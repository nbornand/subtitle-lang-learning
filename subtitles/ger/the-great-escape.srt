1
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:41,144
Go inside.

2
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:45,148
Hurry up.

3
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,148
This way.

4
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:55,104
Hurry up.

5
00:05:06,188 --> 00:05:09,128
Yeah, this'll do.
Which one are you gonna have?

6
00:05:09,148 --> 00:05:11,148
- I...
- No, that's mine.

7
00:05:11,172 --> 00:05:13,176
Allez hup!

8
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,196
How far are the trees, Danny?

9
00:05:52,116 --> 00:05:54,136
Over 200 feet.

10
00:05:54,156 --> 00:05:56,128
Yeah, I'd say 300.

11
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,140
Long ways to dig.

12
00:05:58,172 --> 00:06:02,128
We'll get Cavendish to make a survey.
I wish Big X were here.

13
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:05,124
Willie, you think X got away?

14
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:07,152
He'd have sent us word
somehow if he had.

15
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,160
- Gestapo, you think?
- Either that or he's dead.

16
00:06:26,148 --> 00:06:28,128
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes.

17
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,144
I am Hauptfeldwebel Strachwitz.
Will you accompany me, please?

18
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,124
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.

19
00:06:47,108 --> 00:06:48,188
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

20
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:51,164
Good morning, Group Captain.

21
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,108
I'm Captain Posen, Von Luger's adjutant.
Since you're senior British officer,

22
00:06:57,144 --> 00:07:01,112
you are to be liaison between
the prisoners and the colonel.

23
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,108
He wishes to make clear to you
certain matters of...

24
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:07,124
the word is "policy"?

25
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:08,160
Yes.

26
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,164
Thank you.

27
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,156
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

28
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,128
I am Colonel Von Luger. Please sit down.

29
00:07:37,196 --> 00:07:41,104
Group Captain Ramsey,
in the past four years

30
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,124
the Reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time,

31
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:46,116
energy, manpower and equipment

32
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:49,192
hunting down escaping
prisoner-of-war officers.

33
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:53,100
At least it's rather nice
to know you're wanted, isn't it?

34
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:58,108
For us it's not a matter for levity.
There will be no escapes from this camp.

35
00:07:58,132 --> 00:08:02,108
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn duty
of all officers to try to escape.

36
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,160
If they can't, it is their duty
to cause the enemy

37
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,140
to use an inordinate number
of troops to guard them

38
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:11,124
and their sworn duty to harass
the enemy to the best of their ability.

39
00:08:11,164 --> 00:08:13,144
Yes, I know.

40
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:17,112
The men under your authority
have been most successful.

41
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,196
This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.

42
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,180
Caught in the North Sea, escaped,
recaptured, escaped, recaptured.

43
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:27,164
Archibald "Archie" Ives:
11 escape attempts.

44
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:30,188
Even tried to jump
out of the truck coming here.

45
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:33,100
Dickes, William.

46
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:36,116
Known to have participated
in digging of 11 escape tunnels.

47
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,152
Flight Lieutenant Willinski: four escapes.

48
00:08:38,172 --> 00:08:41,120
MacDonald: nine.
Hendley, the American: five.

49
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:45,104
Haynes: four. Sedgwick: seven.
The list is almost endless.

50
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:48,188
One man here has made
17 attempted escapes.

51
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:51,136
Group Captain, this is close to insanity.

52
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:54,140
- Quite.
- And it must stop!

53
00:08:54,164 --> 00:08:57,152
Colonel, do you expect officers
to forget their duty?

54
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:02,188
No.

55
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,120
It is because we expect the opposite
that we have brought you here.

56
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:10,152
This is a new camp.

57
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:14,108
It has been built
to hold you and your men.

58
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:18,164
It is organised to incorporate all
we have learned of security measures.

59
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:22,188
And in me, you will not be
dealing with a common jailer,

60
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,108
but with a staff officer
personally selected for the task

61
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,124
by the Luftwaffe high command.

62
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:34,100
We have in effect put
all our rotten eggs in one basket,

63
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:37,112
and we intend to watch
this basket carefully.

64
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:39,136
Very wise.

65
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:46,116
You will not be denied the usual facilities.

66
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,144
Sports, a library, a recreation hall,

67
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:54,128
and for gardening we will give you tools.

68
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:57,116
We trust you to use them for gardening.

69
00:09:57,148 --> 00:10:00,112
Devote your energies to these things.

70
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:02,172
Give up your hopeless
attempts to escape.

71
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:06,108
And, with intelligent cooperation,

72
00:10:06,196 --> 00:10:09,120
we may all sit out the war

73
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,128
as comfortably as possible.

74
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:32,196
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.

75
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:36,116
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was only kidding.

76
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:38,172
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.

77
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:41,140
Of course.
Why do you come to Germany?

78
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,124
- Why fight for England, your enemy?
- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?

79
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:48,196
- In 181 2 they burned your capital.
- That's propaganda.

80
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,196
It's in the history books. I read it.

81
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:55,116
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.

82
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:57,120
Yeah. No tools.

83
00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:04,112
Hey, Virgil.

84
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:06,172
Hey, did you see the cooler?

85
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:08,164
Boy, is it ever a big one!

86
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:10,196
- I think they expect a lot of business.
- Yeah.

87
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:15,132
Those two guys who were with us in
the old camp, in hut 14, I can't find them.

88
00:11:15,164 --> 00:11:18,156
- You think the goons left 'em behind?
- I guess.

89
00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:22,116
What were their names?
It was Jackson and...

90
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,140
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.

91
00:11:24,152 --> 00:11:27,140
I'm gonna see who else I can find.
I'll see you later.

92
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,132
Hey, Danny. Who are they?

93
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,128
Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.

94
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,116
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.

95
00:12:01,172 --> 00:12:03,156
Willie, cigarettes.

96
00:12:23,104 --> 00:12:26,148
Danny and I have a blitz in mind. Could
you put on a brief show for the goons?

97
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:29,128
Sure, man. What'll it be? An all-out go?

98
00:12:29,156 --> 00:12:31,192
- Choir practice?
- Knuckles, eh?

99
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:34,192
- Yeah. Knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.

100
00:12:36,152 --> 00:12:39,140
- What are you doing with my coat, mate?
- What? It's mine!

101
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,152
Are you pushing me?

102
00:12:41,184 --> 00:12:43,156
That's mine, you son of a...

103
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:14,188
Stop it! Stop this nonsense!

104
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:18,140
It's all right, mate. We're just
having a friendly little argument.

105
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,128
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.

106
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,100
- Back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.

107
00:13:23,124 --> 00:13:25,112
You, too!

108
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,136
Get away! Get back in your huts!

109
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:32,116
Go on!

110
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:06,140
Hey, Hilts. Looks like there's only
one other American in the whole camp.

111
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:09,100
Some guy named Hendley
in the RAF Eagle squadron.

112
00:14:09,128 --> 00:14:11,176
Hey, you got something goin' already?

113
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:15,104
See the way the goons
got those towers placed?

114
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:18,104
- There's a blind spot through the middle.
- A blind spot?

115
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:20,192
A guy could stand at that wire
and not be seen by either tower.

116
00:14:21,104 --> 00:14:23,184
They'd never see me, especially at night.

117
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:27,168
- You're crazy.
- You think so? Let's find out right now.

118
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:46,188
Now, the next step's a little tricky.

119
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:50,172
- You're not goin' out there?
- Not while they're lookin', I'm not.

120
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:55,128
I think I'll take a little walk.

121
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,116
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- Only one sentence.

122
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:40,120
Let me have it, mate.

123
00:15:47,164 --> 00:15:50,156
- What's it mean?
- I love you.

124
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:52,196
I love you? What bloody good is that?

125
00:15:53,108 --> 00:15:55,168
I don't know.
I wasn't going to use it myself.

126
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:21,136
Out. Out!

127
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:25,140
- Your friend, yes?
- Huh?

128
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:29,176
And who vouches for you,
Lieutenant Willinski?

129
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,172
Get out, Sedgwick.

130
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:09,112
Hold it, hold it!

131
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:14,188
- Your name?
- Ives.

132
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:17,144
Ives.

133
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:21,132
Ives. Oh, yes. Archibald Ives. Scots.

134
00:17:21,176 --> 00:17:23,196
The photograph doesn't do you justice.

135
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,136
I'd like to see one of you
under similar circumstances.

136
00:17:51,128 --> 00:17:53,176
I will not take action against you now.

137
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:58,156
This is the first day here and there has
been much stupidity and carelessness...

138
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:00,180
on both sides.

139
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,156
Hey! Get out!

140
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,112
Don't shoot!

141
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:30,120
You fool! To cross the wire is death!

142
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:33,100
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!

143
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:36,160
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it.
You know that.

144
00:18:36,196 --> 00:18:40,116
But my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?

145
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:43,104
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, OK.

146
00:18:45,128 --> 00:18:48,180
- Gettin' my baseball.
- Stop this! Get over the wire immediately!

147
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:50,180
- OK.
- You stay there!

148
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,116
Out of the way. Out.

149
00:18:57,128 --> 00:18:59,144
What are you doing
over here by the wire?

150
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:01,176
Like I told Max, I was trying to get my...

151
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,160
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like I told Max...

152
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:20,196
I was trying to cut my way through
your wire, because I wanna get out.

153
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:29,140
Do you speak German?

154
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,116
Wire cutters.

155
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:38,180
I have had the pleasure of knowing quite
a number of British officers in this war.

156
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:42,108
And I flatter myself
that we understand one another.

157
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:51,104
You are the first American officer
I have met. Hilts, isn't it?

158
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:53,108
Captain Hilts, actually.

159
00:19:53,128 --> 00:19:55,100
- 17 escape attempts.
- 18, sir.

160
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,192
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

161
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,124
I suppose what's called
in the American army a "hotshot pilot".

162
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,164
Unfortunately,
you were shot down anyway.

163
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:07,148
So we are both grounded
for the duration of the war.

164
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:09,192
Well, you speak for yourself, Colonel.

165
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,132
- You have other plans?
- I haven't seen Berlin yet.

166
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:20,140
I plan on doing so before the war's over.

167
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,180
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?

168
00:20:24,104 --> 00:20:26,168
About 99 per cent.

169
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:29,180
Perhaps while you are with us,
you will have a chance to learn some.

170
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,156
10 days isolation, Hilts.

171
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:35,124
- Captain Hilts.
- 20 days.

172
00:20:35,144 --> 00:20:36,172
Right.

173
00:20:38,132 --> 00:20:41,108
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?

174
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:43,144
Cooler.

175
00:20:51,136 --> 00:20:53,144
- Name?
- Ives.

176
00:20:53,176 --> 00:20:55,136
Flying Officer Ives.

177
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,140
Cooler. 20 days.

178
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:02,164
- Cooler, Ives.
- Pleasure.

179
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,172
- Hilts.
- Yeah?

180
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,188
What did you do in the States?
Play baseball?

181
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,196
No, I was in college.

182
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:47,184
- Say, Ives.
- Aye?

183
00:22:48,112 --> 00:22:51,196
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Four over, seven under.

184
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:57,100
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I am that.

185
00:22:58,192 --> 00:23:01,112
How tall are you, Ives?

186
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:03,104
Five feet four. Why?

187
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:05,164
Oh, just wondering.

188
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:10,152
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?

189
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:14,104
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.

190
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:15,112
Bicycles?

191
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:20,176
Motorcycles. Flat tracks, county fairs.
Picked up a buck here and there.

192
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:24,148
- Helped pay my tuition.
- I did a wee bit of racing myself.

193
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,144
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?

194
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:29,184
No, horse racing. Jockey.

195
00:23:31,196 --> 00:23:33,180
Jockey.

196
00:23:36,188 --> 00:23:37,176
Jockey.

197
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,128
Hilts?

198
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:46,140
Are you there, Hilts?

199
00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:49,176
Yeah, I'm here.

200
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:52,136
Don't you have them in the States?
Jockeys?

201
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,112
Sure.

202
00:23:55,124 --> 00:24:00,148
They were the days. Saturday nights
in towns like Musselburgh and Hamilton.

203
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,144
You had to fight off the birds.

204
00:24:03,156 --> 00:24:05,144
You know, birds.

205
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,140
Girls, man. Girls.

206
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,128
Do you not have them in the States?

207
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,156
Hilts?

208
00:24:14,172 --> 00:24:16,164
Are you there, Hilts?

209
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:19,100
Ives.

210
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:23,152
What?

211
00:24:23,168 --> 00:24:28,100
You know the kind of clay and gravel
we got here in the compound?

212
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,104
How many feet do you think
you could get through in eight hours?

213
00:24:31,128 --> 00:24:35,144
I could go through this dirt here
like the bit on an end of an auger.

214
00:24:36,128 --> 00:24:39,116
But you know it's not the digging.
It's the shoring up with wood

215
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,156
and getting the dirt out -
that's what you've to worry about.

216
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:45,148
No, it isn't, Ives.
You don't have to worry about that.

217
00:24:45,176 --> 00:24:47,184
How are you going to get the dirt out?

218
00:24:48,164 --> 00:24:51,164
- What do they call a mole in Scotland?
- A mole.

219
00:24:53,104 --> 00:24:54,164
Aye.

220
00:24:56,148 --> 00:24:58,180
Well, what do you think?

221
00:24:59,196 --> 00:25:02,132
I must say,
it's an interesting first 20 minutes.

222
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:04,124
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.

223
00:25:04,156 --> 00:25:07,188
As the sergeant out there says,
this is only the first day.

224
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,140
Eric.

225
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:30,140
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.

226
00:25:30,168 --> 00:25:33,124
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.

227
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,144
He has arrived.

228
00:25:44,156 --> 00:25:48,172
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged
into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.

229
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,116
I suggest this prisoner be kept

230
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:03,164
under the strictest
security confinement permanently.

231
00:26:04,152 --> 00:26:07,136
Make a note of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.

232
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,176
We have reason to believe
he is the leader

233
00:26:10,104 --> 00:26:12,164
of numerous criminal escape attempts.

234
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:17,160
Squadron Leader Bartlett
has been three months in your care,

235
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:20,196
and the Gestapo has only
"reason to believe"?

236
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:25,100
If he once more falls into our hands,
he will not be so lucky.

237
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,144
Air-force officer prisoners are
the responsibility of the Luftwaffe,

238
00:26:29,168 --> 00:26:31,136
not the SS,

239
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,100
or the Gestapo.

240
00:26:35,188 --> 00:26:37,160
At present, yes, Herr Oberst.

241
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,120
That is why he is returned
for the moment to your care.

242
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,108
Of course, if the Luftwaffe
is not up to the task,

243
00:26:44,132 --> 00:26:47,120
the prisoners will find themselves
totally in our charge.

244
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,104
We regretfully are not
so professionally understanding.

245
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:57,144
Squadron Leader Bartlett,

246
00:26:58,124 --> 00:27:02,140
if you escape again and be caught,
you will be shot.

247
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,124
Herr Kuhn.

248
00:27:58,188 --> 00:28:00,156
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.

249
00:28:00,168 --> 00:28:02,188
- They dumped you here, too.
- What's this one like?

250
00:28:03,112 --> 00:28:04,192
Well, it's new.

251
00:28:06,108 --> 00:28:08,176
Here. Let's find you a bed.

252
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,168
Thanks.

253
00:28:26,124 --> 00:28:28,100
Come in.

254
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:31,148
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.

255
00:28:32,156 --> 00:28:35,196
- I'll put your bag in your room.
- Thanks, Eric.

256
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:38,184
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.

257
00:28:39,116 --> 00:28:42,124
The fellows wanted to put up
a welcome committee, but that's for later.

258
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:46,156
- I saw Willie and Willinski with Mac.
- A lot of old friends here.

259
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:49,144
- How long have you been here, sir?
- Arrived today.

260
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:52,108
New camp, expert guards, the elite.

261
00:28:53,128 --> 00:28:55,108
You met the commandant?

262
00:28:56,104 --> 00:28:57,196
Yes, I did.

263
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:01,104
What were the Gestapo
and the SS doing with you?

264
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:03,172
They wanted to find out
who helped me to the border.

265
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,164
Who else is here? Cavendish?

266
00:29:05,192 --> 00:29:08,148
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.

267
00:29:08,172 --> 00:29:10,152
- Blythe?
- Yes.

268
00:29:11,152 --> 00:29:13,172
Almost the whole X organisation.

269
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:18,152
Almost. They cleaned out all the other
camps and dumped us in this one.

270
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:22,104
As Von Luger put it:
"All the rotten eggs in one basket."

271
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:25,124
There's madness in their method.

272
00:29:25,136 --> 00:29:27,168
What about Tommy Bristol?

273
00:29:27,192 --> 00:29:29,196
No, but there's an American - Hendley.

274
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,136
Is he a scrounger, blackmailer?

275
00:29:33,192 --> 00:29:36,196
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.

276
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:41,124
Last of the tea until
the Red Cross gets through again.

277
00:29:41,148 --> 00:29:43,152
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.

278
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,140
Did the Gestapo give you a rough time?

279
00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:54,128
Not nearly as rough
as I now intend to give them.

280
00:29:55,124 --> 00:29:59,160
Roger, personal revenge must be
kept out of what we have to do here.

281
00:29:59,184 --> 00:30:01,192
Too many lives are at stake.

282
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:07,192
What my personal feelings are
is of no importance.

283
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:11,196
You appointed me Big X,
and it's my duty to harass,

284
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,176
confound and confuse the enemy
to the best of my ability.

285
00:30:15,108 --> 00:30:17,196
- That's true.
- That's what I intend to do.

286
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:23,128
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink
in this Third Reich of theirs

287
00:30:23,148 --> 00:30:27,132
that thousands of troops'll be
tied up here looking after us.

288
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:28,184
How?

289
00:30:29,116 --> 00:30:31,192
By putting more men out of this

290
00:30:32,104 --> 00:30:34,168
perfect camp of theirs
than have ever escaped before.

291
00:30:34,192 --> 00:30:39,136
Not two or three or a dozen, but 200, 300.
Scatter them all over Germany.

292
00:30:39,168 --> 00:30:41,192
- Think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.

293
00:30:42,124 --> 00:30:46,140
The goons have put every escape artist
in Germany here. You said so yourself.

294
00:30:46,172 --> 00:30:49,112
Have you thought of what it might cost?

295
00:30:51,152 --> 00:30:55,160
I've thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit,

296
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:57,196
knuckle under and crawl.

297
00:30:58,128 --> 00:31:01,112
Surely you don't advocate that,
do you, sir?

298
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:03,180
I have to point out
one thing to you, Roger.

299
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,188
No matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be,

300
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:09,188
the high command have left us
in the hands of the Luftwaffe,

301
00:31:10,124 --> 00:31:12,100
not the Gestapo and the SS.

302
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:17,168
Look, sir, you talk about
the high command of the Luftwaffe,

303
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:19,136
then the SS and the Gestapo.

304
00:31:19,152 --> 00:31:23,120
To me they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.

305
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,124
There's only one way to put it, sir.

306
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:28,176
They are the common enemies of
everyone who believes in freedom.

307
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:31,184
If they didn't approve of Hitler,
why didn't they throw him out?

308
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:34,152
I have no argument with you, Roger.

309
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:38,136
As senior officer, I'm merely
pointing out a pertinent fact.

310
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:44,112
When are you calling a meeting, X?

311
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,184
Tonight.

312
00:32:04,196 --> 00:32:10,140
Gentlemen, no doubt you've heard the
immortal words of our new commandant.

313
00:32:10,168 --> 00:32:13,104
"Devote your energies
to things other than escape

314
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:15,120
and sit out the war
as comfortably as possible."

315
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:20,152
Well, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

316
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,180
We're going to devote our energies
to sports and gardening,

317
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,168
all the cultural pursuits
as far as they're concerned.

318
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,168
In fact, we're going to
put the goons to sleep.

319
00:32:30,144 --> 00:32:33,108
Meanwhile, we dig.

320
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:37,144
Now, even a superficial look
at the compound

321
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,176
shows us that huts 104 and 5
are closest to the woods.

322
00:32:40,188 --> 00:32:43,112
The first tunnel goes out from 105,

323
00:32:43,132 --> 00:32:46,112
directly east
under the cooler and the wire.

324
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:48,132
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.

325
00:32:48,156 --> 00:32:51,120
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.

326
00:32:51,144 --> 00:32:54,172
- I make it just over 335 feet.
- Tell me when you've got an exact one.

327
00:32:55,104 --> 00:32:58,160
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down
30 feet before we go horizontal.

328
00:32:58,188 --> 00:33:01,192
That'll rule out any question
of sound detection or probing.

329
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,132
All right, Roger,
but did you say the first tunnel?

330
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:08,120
I did. There'll be three.

331
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,144
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104.

332
00:33:13,176 --> 00:33:18,140
Dick goes north from the kitchen, and
Harry goes out parallel to Tom from 105.

333
00:33:20,116 --> 00:33:23,100
If the goons find one,
we'll move into the other.

334
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:26,184
How many men do you
plan to take out, Roger?

335
00:33:27,116 --> 00:33:28,112
250.

336
00:33:29,172 --> 00:33:33,188
There'll be no half measures this time.
Identification papers for everyone.

337
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,120
And, Griff, we'll need outfits for the lot.

338
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,164
- 250?
- Mostly civilian clothes.

339
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,176
Yes, but...

340
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:44,188
OK, Roger.

341
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:49,144
Mac. Maps, blankets, rations,
compasses for all the walkers.

342
00:33:49,168 --> 00:33:51,184
- Timetables for every train.
- Right, Roger.

343
00:33:57,148 --> 00:34:00,132
- Sorry I'm late, Roger.
- It's all right, Colin. Sit down.

344
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:02,140
We're going to tunnel.

345
00:34:03,188 --> 00:34:05,156
Splendid.

346
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,112
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings.
Danny, you'll be in charge of traps.

347
00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:14,132
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.

348
00:34:14,172 --> 00:34:19,104
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions. Mac,
of course, will take care of intelligence.

349
00:34:19,136 --> 00:34:21,148
Hendley. We haven't met.

350
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,160
- Scrounger?
- Right.

351
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:26,188
Dennis, maps and surveys.

352
00:34:27,104 --> 00:34:31,120
Colin, you'll take your usual job. Eric,
how are you gonna get rid of this dirt?

353
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,120
Usual places. I hadn't anticipated
three tunnels, but we'll manage.

354
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:39,152
Roger, who's going to handle
security for all this?

355
00:34:39,192 --> 00:34:43,164
You are. I want a system of stooges
covering this compound

356
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:47,140
from front to back,
checking every goon in and out.

357
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:51,164
I want a signal system so perfect
that if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet

358
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,104
of any of the huts in which we're working,
we can shut down without a sign.

359
00:34:57,164 --> 00:35:00,184
Well, I don't think there's much point
in discussing any more now.

360
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:05,164
I'll meet each of you on the exercise
circuit, and we'll pound out the details.

361
00:35:08,128 --> 00:35:10,108
Nothing else, is there, Mac?

362
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,144
I shouldn't think so, Roger.

363
00:35:37,108 --> 00:35:39,112
Oh, hello.

364
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,172
My name's Blythe.

365
00:35:42,108 --> 00:35:43,104
Hendley.

366
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,108
- For birds.
- I used to do a little hunting myself.

367
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,196
Oh, not hunting. Watching.

368
00:35:53,176 --> 00:35:56,152
Oh, a bird watcher?

369
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,124
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and drawing them.

370
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,128
I suppose you have
bird watchers in the States?

371
00:36:05,144 --> 00:36:07,152
Yes, we have some.

372
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,108
Tea?

373
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,156
I only drank tea once, in the hospital.

374
00:36:15,136 --> 00:36:17,112
Where's your kit?

375
00:36:17,128 --> 00:36:21,124
This is it. The rest was confiscated
in the last shakedown.

376
00:36:21,188 --> 00:36:26,124
The goons didn't appreciate
some of my more personal items.

377
00:36:29,176 --> 00:36:31,116
Such as.

378
00:36:31,168 --> 00:36:34,160
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.

379
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:37,128
I'll need a camera.

380
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,188
- What kind?
- A good one.

381
00:36:40,196 --> 00:36:45,192
A 35mm f2.8 with a focal-plane shutter
should do all right.

382
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:49,196
All right.

383
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:52,128
- And film, of course.
- Oh, of course.

384
00:36:54,132 --> 00:36:57,144
Oh, Hendley. I need a pick. Big heavy one.

385
00:36:57,176 --> 00:36:59,196
- Only one?
- Two would be better.

386
00:37:04,136 --> 00:37:06,148
I'm afraid this tea's pathetic.

387
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,152
I must have used these
wretched leaves about 20 times.

388
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:13,112
It's not that I mind so much.

389
00:37:13,128 --> 00:37:15,184
Tea without milk is so uncivilised.

390
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:18,152
Yeah.

391
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:20,124
I'll get our wood.

392
00:37:27,192 --> 00:37:29,160
Close up! Close up!

393
00:37:37,144 --> 00:37:39,124
Close up!

394
00:37:40,164 --> 00:37:42,124
Close up!

395
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,152
Close up!

396
00:37:43,168 --> 00:37:46,156
- No me sprechen the English.
- Close up!

397
00:38:10,156 --> 00:38:12,132
Splendid.

398
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:27,104
Blythe, what are you doing here?

399
00:38:27,196 --> 00:38:31,148
I'm in Photographic Aerial
Reconnaissance lnterpretation.

400
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,132
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
It's my own silly fault.

401
00:38:35,152 --> 00:38:40,100
The aircraft bought it.
Got shot down. Terrifying.

402
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,192
- No, I mean, what do you do here?
- Here?

403
00:38:47,128 --> 00:38:49,108
I'm the forger.

404
00:39:08,108 --> 00:39:10,164
Forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut.

405
00:39:10,196 --> 00:39:12,116
- Sedgwick?
- I'm in 1 10.

406
00:39:12,148 --> 00:39:15,176
- Griffith.
- Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.

407
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,192
109? Right.

408
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:22,128
I'll work in 107. For now, Danny, Willie
and their trap team will be in 104.

409
00:39:22,156 --> 00:39:26,156
I want to take a chance on the tunnels
and press ahead without any shoring-up.

410
00:39:26,184 --> 00:39:29,172
We will need timber for the shafts
and the entrance chambers.

411
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:32,160
Hendley figures
there are 36 empty bunks.

412
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:36,116
We can tear up 1 5 and move the men
around so the goons won't miss them.

413
00:39:36,132 --> 00:39:38,124
The rest will come
from strips off the wall.

414
00:39:38,136 --> 00:39:41,124
- Is Hendley taking care of this himself?
- Not yet.

415
00:39:41,136 --> 00:39:44,112
He's working on some steel
for a pick that Danny needs.

416
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,168
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

417
00:40:03,196 --> 00:40:06,196
Turn the water off! Get your hands away!

418
00:40:08,132 --> 00:40:09,140
Get away!

419
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,124
Hey! What the hell's going on there?

420
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,184
Stop this nonsense!

421
00:40:18,192 --> 00:40:20,100
Get away!

422
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:21,176
Turn the water off!

423
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:22,176
Somewhere!

424
00:41:01,148 --> 00:41:06,108
In the stove, we keep fire burning always.
The goons will not feel like moving it.

425
00:41:06,136 --> 00:41:10,124
- Good.
- Hendley, two tiles, they are chipped.

426
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:13,152
- We need new ones.
- There's some in 1 1 3's washroom.

427
00:41:13,172 --> 00:41:15,144
- Should match perfectly.
- Good.

428
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,176
It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.

429
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:30,104
Not when you're organised, Mac.

430
00:41:34,176 --> 00:41:36,168
- We're ready.
- Big enough?

431
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,152
It's perfect. Right through
the middle of the foundation.

432
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:47,188
Good luck to us, Danny.

433
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:08,116
Why 17?

434
00:42:08,144 --> 00:42:11,120
This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.

435
00:42:41,164 --> 00:42:43,152
All right?

436
00:42:58,104 --> 00:42:59,176
It's good.

437
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,112
It's very good.

438
00:43:46,188 --> 00:43:48,172
Get out! Get out!

439
00:44:11,132 --> 00:44:14,176
You're not in your hut?
What are you doing here?

440
00:44:15,104 --> 00:44:15,184
Mopping up.

441
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,188
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.

442
00:44:27,104 --> 00:44:29,144
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.

443
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:37,112
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.

444
00:45:24,108 --> 00:45:27,180
No. I vote no. Look, we've put
the goons to sleep exactly like you said.

445
00:45:28,104 --> 00:45:32,116
But just one little thing like this
and we're up the creek without a paddle.

446
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,148
- Ives, sit down, won't you?
- Hello, sir.

447
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,136
Hello. Squadron Leader Bartlett,
Captain Hilts.

448
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,192
Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.

449
00:45:41,124 --> 00:45:44,148
I understand you two
are contemplating a blitz-out.

450
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:46,180
Where'd you hear that... sir?

451
00:45:46,188 --> 00:45:50,140
MacDonald. It's Mac's job
to know everything that goes on.

452
00:45:50,172 --> 00:45:53,132
We thought perhaps we might talk it over.

453
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,168
Why? It's only a two-man job.

454
00:45:55,196 --> 00:45:59,136
Everybody in the camp is supposed to
clear all escape attempts in advance

455
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,184
with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.

456
00:46:01,196 --> 00:46:04,132
We don't necessarily want to interfere.

457
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,140
It's just that... well, what sort of blitz
were you contemplating?

458
00:46:10,108 --> 00:46:13,104
We sneak out at night to a spot
I found near the wire - a blind spot.

459
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:16,164
Then we dig down, take the dirt,
spread it on top so it won't make a pile,

460
00:46:16,188 --> 00:46:18,140
and then straight out.

461
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,124
Ives here is a tunnel man, so he digs
in front, pushes the dirt behind him.

462
00:46:22,156 --> 00:46:25,196
I stash it behind me, then we burrow
through the dirt like a couple of moles.

463
00:46:26,128 --> 00:46:30,176
By dawn we're under the wire, across
the open space, into the woods and gone.

464
00:46:37,124 --> 00:46:38,120
Well...

465
00:46:41,108 --> 00:46:43,124
When do you intend to try this?

466
00:46:43,152 --> 00:46:46,100
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.

467
00:46:46,196 --> 00:46:51,120
Hilts, this may not be quite
the right time for this sort of thing.

468
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:54,152
Look, sir, I've been in the bag
nearly three years now,

469
00:46:54,172 --> 00:46:56,176
bloody close to being wire-happy.

470
00:46:56,196 --> 00:46:59,176
It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.

471
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,172
It'll work. I know it will.

472
00:47:10,152 --> 00:47:11,184
Good luck.

473
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,192
Thank you.

474
00:47:15,168 --> 00:47:19,168
- Hilts, um... how do you breathe?
- We got a steel rod with hinges on it.

475
00:47:19,192 --> 00:47:22,128
We shove it up and make air holes
as we go along.

476
00:47:22,148 --> 00:47:24,132
Good night, sir.

477
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:32,172
Now, why didn't anybody
think of that before?

478
00:47:32,196 --> 00:47:36,116
It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.

479
00:47:36,132 --> 00:47:39,112
But it'll bring every goon
in the camp down on top of us.

480
00:47:39,132 --> 00:47:41,156
I don't know.
Perhaps we're being too clever.

481
00:47:41,176 --> 00:47:43,152
If we stop all the breakouts,

482
00:47:43,184 --> 00:47:47,104
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunnelling.

483
00:47:47,136 --> 00:47:52,156
I hope it works. If it doesn't, they're going
to be in the cooler for an awful long time.

484
00:48:36,152 --> 00:48:39,128
- Good, huh?
- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

485
00:48:45,176 --> 00:48:49,112
- This is the dirt from the compound.
- This is from the tunnel.

486
00:48:55,136 --> 00:48:58,128
Wherever we put it,
they're going to spot it a mile away.

487
00:48:58,148 --> 00:49:01,136
Maybe we could put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.

488
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,196
It's the first place the ferrets would look.
I saw one measuring yesterday.

489
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,124
Maybe we could dry it to the same colour.

490
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:11,108
- There are 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.

491
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:14,156
If you must think,
for God's sake, think clearly.

492
00:49:15,156 --> 00:49:17,148
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?

493
00:49:18,196 --> 00:49:22,116
We can't destroy the dirt
and we can't eat it.

494
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:25,128
The only thing left to do is camouflage it.

495
00:49:25,156 --> 00:49:28,104
That's as far as my thinking takes me.

496
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,152
Didn't they teach you
promptness in the RN?

497
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:34,144
You'll never believe it,
but I think I have the solution.

498
00:49:34,176 --> 00:49:38,160
The problem is somehow to get rid of
this tunnel dirt over the compound.

499
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,164
Well, of course.

500
00:49:41,136 --> 00:49:43,128
Would you mind?

501
00:49:52,176 --> 00:49:54,156
Now...

502
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,160
you fill these bags
with the dirt from the tunnel.

503
00:49:59,172 --> 00:50:02,180
Then, wearing them inside your trousers,

504
00:50:03,112 --> 00:50:05,116
you wander out into the compound

505
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:09,120
where you pull these
strings in your pockets.

506
00:50:10,116 --> 00:50:12,132
Out come the pins.

507
00:50:15,104 --> 00:50:19,176
- Eric, it's good.
- All you have to do is kick it in.

508
00:50:20,116 --> 00:50:22,144
Unless you're a fool,
the ferrets won't see a thing.

509
00:50:22,172 --> 00:50:25,144
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger?

510
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:29,160
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.
- I already have. It works.

511
00:50:31,136 --> 00:50:33,176
Mac, this is what we'll do.

512
00:50:48,104 --> 00:50:50,192
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Thank you, Nimmo.

513
00:50:59,132 --> 00:51:01,124
Nice garden you've got, sir.

514
00:51:32,192 --> 00:51:34,176
All right. Let's look sharp.

515
00:51:41,192 --> 00:51:42,184
That looks sharp.

516
00:51:47,124 --> 00:51:48,164
Sir.

517
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:55,196
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.

518
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,192
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.

519
00:52:13,124 --> 00:52:17,100
I am sorry the soil here isn't
better suited to your men's purpose.

520
00:52:17,128 --> 00:52:19,104
We'll manage, sir.

521
00:52:28,128 --> 00:52:32,112
I must say I am surprised with
the extent of this activity, Group Captain.

522
00:52:32,144 --> 00:52:35,196
- Pleased, of course, but surprised.
- Surprised, Colonel?

523
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:41,140
Fliers are gentlemen, not peasants
to dig in the earth. So I am surprised.

524
00:52:41,196 --> 00:52:43,184
The English are keen on gardening.

525
00:52:43,188 --> 00:52:47,168
Oh, yes, but flowers. Is this not so?

526
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:50,172
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.

527
00:52:52,192 --> 00:52:54,172
Good point.

528
00:53:11,116 --> 00:53:14,116
I have the nasty feeling
he knows exactly what we're doing.

529
00:53:14,128 --> 00:53:17,128
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so, do you?

530
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,192
If he does, we'll find out soon enough.

531
00:53:31,132 --> 00:53:33,112
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.

532
00:53:33,136 --> 00:53:36,136
Here we are. Now, let's see.

533
00:53:36,156 --> 00:53:38,188
Biscuits, two packets.

534
00:53:39,112 --> 00:53:41,112
Coffee, two tins.

535
00:53:41,144 --> 00:53:43,148
Bovril, one jar.

536
00:53:43,168 --> 00:53:46,108
Cigarettes, six packets.

537
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,132
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.
Black currant jam, Cavendish.

538
00:53:50,164 --> 00:53:52,156
And marmalade, mine.

539
00:53:52,168 --> 00:53:56,172
Danish butter, Von Luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.

540
00:53:57,104 --> 00:54:01,128
Oh, yes. And Dutch chocolate. Two bars.

541
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:05,156
That cleans out the gift food
for the entire organisation.

542
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:08,164
Now, the first thing we need
is the new form of travel permit.

543
00:54:09,108 --> 00:54:11,168
The forgers have no idea
what it looks like.

544
00:54:11,176 --> 00:54:13,104
I'll see what I can do.

545
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:16,164
And, of course, any other
identity cards, personal papers,

546
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,180
documents you can put your hands on.

547
00:54:19,104 --> 00:54:21,104
- Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.
- Right.

548
00:54:21,128 --> 00:54:23,108
Good luck.

549
00:54:30,188 --> 00:54:34,160
O come all ye faithful

550
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:37,188
Joyful and triumphant

551
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,184
O come ye

552
00:54:40,112 --> 00:54:45,124
O come ye to Bethlehem

553
00:54:45,168 --> 00:54:48,164
Come and behold Him

554
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:51,188
Born the King of Angels

555
00:54:52,108 --> 00:54:55,148
O come let us adore Him

556
00:54:55,172 --> 00:54:58,192
O come let us adore Him

557
00:54:59,104 --> 00:55:03,140
O come let us adore Him

558
00:55:03,152 --> 00:55:05,192
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?

559
00:55:06,124 --> 00:55:07,196
Patience is a virtue, Roger.

560
00:55:08,116 --> 00:55:11,168
Yes, I know, but the diggers
can only work when the trap's open,

561
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,116
and this is holding us up very badly.

562
00:55:16,128 --> 00:55:18,100
- Is it finished?
- Of course.

563
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,188
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.

564
00:55:21,112 --> 00:55:24,120
- Well, when will they be finished?
- One or two days.

565
00:55:24,148 --> 00:55:26,164
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.

566
00:55:27,184 --> 00:55:30,172
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.

567
00:55:31,152 --> 00:55:32,192
Mac.

568
00:55:33,112 --> 00:55:34,188
Excellent.

569
00:55:35,184 --> 00:55:38,108
Have it in by tomorrow night.

570
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:42,124
Christ the Lord

571
00:55:48,148 --> 00:55:50,164
- Got a light?
- Yeah.

572
00:55:53,192 --> 00:55:55,144
Thanks.

573
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:57,160
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

574
00:56:05,176 --> 00:56:07,192
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?

575
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,128
I'll smoke it later when I'm off duty.
Thank you.

576
00:56:13,148 --> 00:56:16,124
You probably have
a couple of roommates, huh?

577
00:56:17,152 --> 00:56:21,188
- Beautiful day.
- Yes, but I think it might rain later.

578
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,148
No, no.

579
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:26,148
Red sky in the morning,
sailor takes warning.

580
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,172
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

581
00:56:28,196 --> 00:56:30,188
It was a red sky last night.

582
00:56:30,188 --> 00:56:32,156
I never heard that before.

583
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,192
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.

584
00:56:35,124 --> 00:56:37,160
- You were a Boy Scout? So was l.
- Really?

585
00:56:37,176 --> 00:56:40,148
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.
- I had 20.

586
00:56:41,144 --> 00:56:44,192
I was working on my 20th when
the government abolished scouting

587
00:56:45,116 --> 00:56:48,164
and sent me into the Hitler Youth instead.

588
00:56:51,176 --> 00:56:55,148
Werner, you think you'll stay
in the army after the war?

589
00:56:55,184 --> 00:56:58,136
No. I'm not a well man.

590
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,128
- And my teeth...
- Your teeth?

591
00:57:00,152 --> 00:57:02,196
Yes. I could tell you
stories about my teeth

592
00:57:03,116 --> 00:57:05,128
that would make your hair stand on end.

593
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:07,168
Our dentist here is a butcher.

594
00:57:09,128 --> 00:57:11,148
But don't tell anyone I said so.

595
00:57:12,144 --> 00:57:14,160
It's a soldier's right to complain.

596
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,112
Maybe in your army, but here?

597
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:21,176
One little criticism,
and... to the Russian front.

598
00:57:22,104 --> 00:57:25,128
Is that so? Terrible.

599
00:57:26,132 --> 00:57:28,104
That's terrible.

600
00:57:33,136 --> 00:57:35,116
Werner.

601
00:57:37,184 --> 00:57:39,196
Why don't we go into my room?

602
00:57:40,108 --> 00:57:42,184
I'd better not.
If Strachwitz should see me...

603
00:57:45,152 --> 00:57:47,196
I was just gonna make some coffee.

604
00:57:50,152 --> 00:57:52,144
Real coffee.

605
00:58:19,156 --> 00:58:22,120
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

606
00:58:22,144 --> 00:58:24,116
Where is it?

607
00:58:30,108 --> 00:58:33,100
My grandmother keeps
sending me this stuff.

608
00:58:38,144 --> 00:58:40,164
Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.

609
00:58:48,176 --> 00:58:50,160
Yeah. Keep it.

610
00:58:50,172 --> 00:58:52,160
Nein. I must go.

611
00:58:53,136 --> 00:58:55,184
It's OK. You can keep it. We're friends.

612
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,188
With you in the cooler,
will we be friends? I must report this.

613
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:04,112
I don't understand you. Report what?
That you and I were chatting in my room?

614
00:59:04,144 --> 00:59:07,100
- I must go.
- Oh, here. It's OK. Look, keep it.

615
00:59:07,124 --> 00:59:10,164
I'll never be able to eat it all.
I've got all I could eat.

616
00:59:10,184 --> 00:59:13,132
I'm sorry. All right. Forget it. Forget it.

617
00:59:44,168 --> 00:59:48,160
And that, I'm sure you'll all remember,
is the voice of the Nelles warbler.

618
00:59:48,196 --> 00:59:52,104
Let's turn our attention to this gentleman -
the masked shrike.

619
00:59:52,132 --> 00:59:54,156
Lanius nubicus. The butcherbird.

620
00:59:54,188 --> 00:59:58,108
The shrike impales his foes
on the spikes of thorn bushes.

621
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:01,192
Not a very lovable character, you see.
Let's have a look at the colouring.

622
01:00:02,108 --> 01:00:05,128
Uniform black above, from head to tail.

623
01:00:05,148 --> 01:00:10,156
A black rump, a black crown with a bold
white flash, and a white line over the eye.

624
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:13,144
The shrike lives
in lightly wooded country...

625
01:00:13,156 --> 01:00:17,132
Ah. Hendley. Sit down. You'll find
drawing materials on the table.

626
01:00:18,124 --> 01:00:21,180
The shrike lives in lightly wooded
country, olive groves and gardens.

627
01:00:22,108 --> 01:00:24,136
Well, Hendley, have you
taken to birds too now?

628
01:00:24,156 --> 01:00:27,100
Yeah. Stick around.
You might learn something.

629
01:00:27,136 --> 01:00:29,176
I have better things to do than draw birds.

630
01:00:30,176 --> 01:00:35,152
The voice is a monotonous succession
of scratchy, complaining notes.

631
01:00:35,188 --> 01:00:39,116
Now, let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a round shape...

632
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,156
An Urlaubsschein. Permission to
cross a frontier. Here's another one.

633
01:01:02,172 --> 01:01:04,196
Which one's the forgery?

634
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:08,140
- That one.
- That's right.

635
01:01:08,172 --> 01:01:10,132
They both are.

636
01:01:10,176 --> 01:01:13,172
What's holding us up now is
the new form of this travel permit.

637
01:01:13,196 --> 01:01:16,152
- We've no idea what they look like.
- Here's one.

638
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,164
And a military identity card.

639
01:01:21,152 --> 01:01:22,180
And a...

640
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:24,152
- An Ausweis.
- Yeah.

641
01:01:24,172 --> 01:01:28,136
- Permission to be on Reich property.
- A ticket to Oden.

642
01:01:28,156 --> 01:01:32,132
What appears to be the ferret
assignments for the next week.

643
01:01:33,104 --> 01:01:35,120
You get 10 out of 10 for this, old boy.

644
01:01:35,136 --> 01:01:39,104
- Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?

645
01:01:40,128 --> 01:01:41,192
It's on loan.

646
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,116
In order to get
the right amount of outfits, Roger,

647
01:01:46,148 --> 01:01:49,160
I suggest that we work
mainly from service uniforms.

648
01:01:49,188 --> 01:01:53,144
I can do double-breasteds,
single-breasteds,

649
01:01:53,172 --> 01:01:56,140
and rather nice lounge suits.

650
01:01:56,148 --> 01:01:58,196
Lapels. I can do quite a lot
of things with those.

651
01:01:59,108 --> 01:02:03,136
I can have them deep like that
or high ones like that.

652
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:07,148
Here's one that
we're working on right now.

653
01:02:07,184 --> 01:02:10,108
Oh, yes. What about buttons?

654
01:02:11,132 --> 01:02:15,168
Take a look at those.
Here's one that I've finished, Roger.

655
01:02:17,184 --> 01:02:23,184
And here's one that I dyed
with a bottle of blue ink.

656
01:02:25,152 --> 01:02:28,140
It's rather good. What's up, Roger?

657
01:02:28,164 --> 01:02:31,128
The goons'd have a field day
if they crashed in on this lot.

658
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:35,156
That's Sorren's department. Now, I've
started working on the other materials.

659
01:02:35,188 --> 01:02:37,176
This blanket.

660
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,176
Particularly the stripes. Marvellous.

661
01:02:40,196 --> 01:02:42,104
- Coats.
- Yes.

662
01:02:42,136 --> 01:02:44,192
I've got the chaps working on these
all over the compound.

663
01:02:45,112 --> 01:02:47,180
Those battle dresses -
I'm afraid they're a bit too short.

664
01:02:48,112 --> 01:02:52,140
I'll have to get the chaps to make those
into some sort of workingman's outfits.

665
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,184
Blanket ticking.

666
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:59,132
Now, I've made these into
rather nice little waistcoats.

667
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:02,196
- Very dapper, yes. Dyed, of course.
- Of course.

668
01:03:03,136 --> 01:03:05,152
Just take a look at this, Roger.

669
01:03:05,184 --> 01:03:10,152
Now, this blanket material, we scrape
this down until it's really smooth,

670
01:03:10,188 --> 01:03:12,180
and then dye it with boot polish.

671
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:16,172
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
I wish we had more of this.

672
01:03:17,112 --> 01:03:19,168
- Where in God's name did you get these?
- Hendley.

673
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,196
- Where did he get them?
- I asked him that.

674
01:03:22,136 --> 01:03:24,160
- What did he say?
- "Don't ask."

675
01:03:24,196 --> 01:03:27,172
Let me show you some of the overcoats
I've been working on.

676
01:03:56,164 --> 01:03:58,144
Good morning, Hilts.

677
01:04:00,104 --> 01:04:02,192
Well, if you're here to find out
if I'm going out again, I am.

678
01:04:03,136 --> 01:04:05,116
- When?
- 17 days. 7th of July.

679
01:04:05,136 --> 01:04:07,104
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.

680
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,152
Is Ives going with you?

681
01:04:09,164 --> 01:04:12,120
Yeah, if he wants to.

682
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:15,160
You know that Ives is close to cracking?

683
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,160
Yeah.

684
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:23,104
- Better for him to go out in the tunnel?
- Safer.

685
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:29,176
Right.

686
01:04:32,104 --> 01:04:35,136
It's possible for one man to get out
through the wire, even get away,

687
01:04:35,152 --> 01:04:40,176
but there are in fact a considerable
number of people besides yourself

688
01:04:41,112 --> 01:04:43,120
in this camp who are trying to escape.

689
01:04:44,132 --> 01:04:46,108
I appreciate that.

690
01:04:48,168 --> 01:04:50,148
Something's coming - I can feel it -

691
01:04:50,172 --> 01:04:54,100
and it's coming right around the corner
at me, Squadron Leader.

692
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,132
- My name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.

693
01:04:56,148 --> 01:04:58,168
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?

694
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:02,140
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.

695
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:07,144
Yes, well, as I was saying, Hilts,

696
01:05:08,184 --> 01:05:11,148
we have maps of Germany -
general maps, that is.

697
01:05:11,172 --> 01:05:15,156
We have all the information we need
for the escape routes out of Germany.

698
01:05:15,184 --> 01:05:17,176
But what we do not have...

699
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:21,120
Is a clear idea of what's 500 yards
beyond those trees.

700
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,120
We've tried every goon in the camp.
No go.

701
01:05:24,132 --> 01:05:27,180
We must know the exact position
of the local town.

702
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:30,172
We want to know where
we hit the main roads.

703
01:05:31,104 --> 01:05:34,124
Where the police stations are,
where they've got their roadblocks.

704
01:05:34,144 --> 01:05:38,148
And most important of all,
we've got to know how to get from here

705
01:05:38,192 --> 01:05:41,116
to the railway station.

706
01:05:41,136 --> 01:05:44,156
No. Absolutely not.
When I get through that wire,

707
01:05:44,188 --> 01:05:47,132
I'm not gonna be
making maps for you guys.

708
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:52,168
I'm gonna be so far away, you won't hear
if they're shooting at me with howitzers.

709
01:05:52,196 --> 01:05:55,156
- Understandable.
- Completely.

710
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,116
I mean, I'd like to help, but...

711
01:06:03,176 --> 01:06:06,100
Interesting idea.

712
01:06:06,124 --> 01:06:09,128
- How many you taking out?
- 250.

713
01:06:11,188 --> 01:06:13,180
250?

714
01:06:14,108 --> 01:06:15,172
Yeah.

715
01:06:16,136 --> 01:06:18,116
You're crazy. You too.

716
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,168
250 guys just walking down the road,
just like that.

717
01:06:21,192 --> 01:06:25,152
Well, some on the road, some by train,
some cross-country.

718
01:06:25,176 --> 01:06:27,188
They'll have forged papers, clothes,

719
01:06:28,116 --> 01:06:29,180
maps, compasses, rations.

720
01:06:30,112 --> 01:06:32,168
You're gonna alert
every goon in the country.

721
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:35,184
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you.

722
01:06:36,116 --> 01:06:40,168
They're gonna swoop down and scoop
you up so fast it'd make your head swim.

723
01:06:43,152 --> 01:06:45,124
Yes, well, thanks, anyway.

724
01:06:45,144 --> 01:06:48,144
- If I can help on the tunnel, let me know.
- That's good of you.

725
01:06:48,168 --> 01:06:50,148
Any time.

726
01:06:51,168 --> 01:06:56,176
Wait a minute. You aren't seriously
suggesting that if I get through the wire

727
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,196
and case everything out there
and don't get picked up,

728
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:02,172
to turn myself in
and get thrown back in the cooler

729
01:07:02,196 --> 01:07:05,112
so you can get the information you need?

730
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:09,176
Yes. One has to ask some very
strange things in the job I have.

731
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,180
- We'll give you a front place.
- I wouldn't do that for my own mother.

732
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,188
- I don't blame you.
- Well, OK, then.

733
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,160
- It's completely understandable.
- Well, OK, then.

734
01:07:20,124 --> 01:07:22,116
Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.

735
01:07:29,112 --> 01:07:31,104
Check.

736
01:07:33,192 --> 01:07:35,160
Herr Hendley, l...

737
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:38,104
Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.

738
01:07:40,196 --> 01:07:44,148
- What's the matter, Werner?
- My wallet, my papers, my identity card.

739
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:47,184
Gone. I lost them. Everything.

740
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:50,156
He lost his wallet.

741
01:07:50,176 --> 01:07:53,192
Do you realise what would happen
if Strachwitz found this out?

742
01:07:54,108 --> 01:07:55,196
- The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.

743
01:07:59,128 --> 01:08:01,160
I've looked every place, every place.

744
01:08:02,156 --> 01:08:05,180
I must have lost them while I was in here.

745
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,116
- No.
- Yes.

746
01:08:08,144 --> 01:08:12,100
Look, I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.

747
01:08:12,128 --> 01:08:14,144
Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.

748
01:08:15,184 --> 01:08:17,140
Werner.

749
01:08:17,164 --> 01:08:20,152
Not now. It might look a little peculiar

750
01:08:20,172 --> 01:08:23,192
if you and I were seen
probing around at this time of night.

751
01:08:25,108 --> 01:08:29,192
Look, I'll find them. I promise you I'll
find 'em if I have to tear this room apart.

752
01:08:36,164 --> 01:08:38,188
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

753
01:08:39,116 --> 01:08:40,148
- Werner.
- Yes?

754
01:08:40,168 --> 01:08:42,188
There is one small favour.

755
01:08:43,124 --> 01:08:45,156
A camera.

756
01:08:46,184 --> 01:08:50,108
We want to take some snapshots.
You know, keepsakes.

757
01:08:51,164 --> 01:08:55,128
35mm with a 2.8 lens and a plane shutter.

758
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,140
Focal-plane shutter.

759
01:08:59,112 --> 01:09:02,124
Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.

760
01:09:03,168 --> 01:09:05,132
Let me know when you got it.

761
01:09:09,192 --> 01:09:14,136
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid,
that Werner, but I like him.

762
01:09:14,156 --> 01:09:16,140
Checkmate.

763
01:09:39,156 --> 01:09:41,160
How soon's our air pump
going to be ready?

764
01:09:41,192 --> 01:09:45,108
- I'll have it for you tomorrow.
- You're badly behind schedule.

765
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,136
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.

766
01:09:47,168 --> 01:09:50,100
- No good?
- Today, three times.

767
01:10:07,116 --> 01:10:08,136
Willie, you all right?

768
01:10:08,136 --> 01:10:10,124
Pull!

769
01:10:37,192 --> 01:10:42,160
You're gonna have to shore up the whole
bloody tunnel, Roger. All 335 feet of it.

770
01:10:42,188 --> 01:10:44,164
Four times today.

771
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:49,132
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.

772
01:10:50,156 --> 01:10:53,156
It's a lot of timber, Roger. Can you get it?

773
01:10:56,144 --> 01:10:59,120
We'll get it. We've gotta get it.

774
01:11:00,152 --> 01:11:03,192
I'll put Hendley on it,
and the new man we got this morning.

775
01:11:04,188 --> 01:11:05,192
OK, Willie.

776
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:09,160
On the first day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

777
01:11:09,188 --> 01:11:12,124
A partridge in a pear tree

778
01:11:12,168 --> 01:11:15,156
On the second day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

779
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:19,108
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

780
01:11:19,168 --> 01:11:22,156
On the fourth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

781
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:24,184
Four calling birds, three French hens

782
01:11:25,104 --> 01:11:28,164
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

783
01:11:28,188 --> 01:11:32,108
On the fifth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

784
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:34,196
Five gold rings

785
01:11:36,144 --> 01:11:40,116
- How's it going with the rafters up there?
- Taking out one in four.

786
01:11:45,192 --> 01:11:46,188
Stay with it.

787
01:11:46,192 --> 01:11:49,180
Five gold rings

788
01:11:50,108 --> 01:11:51,192
Four calling birds, three French hens

789
01:11:52,116 --> 01:11:55,164
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

790
01:11:55,176 --> 01:11:58,196
On the seventh day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

791
01:11:59,136 --> 01:12:01,160
Seven swans a-swimming,
six geese a-laying

792
01:12:01,184 --> 01:12:04,172
Five gold rings

793
01:12:05,104 --> 01:12:06,188
Four calling birds, three French hens

794
01:12:07,116 --> 01:12:11,100
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

795
01:12:23,192 --> 01:12:26,156
Five gold rings, four calling birds...

796
01:12:27,104 --> 01:12:30,108
Bloody singing. I've never worked
so hard in all my life. Hi, Hilts.

797
01:12:30,124 --> 01:12:31,120
Say, Cavendish...

798
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,112
Three French hens, two turtle doves

799
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,112
And a partridge in a pear...

800
01:12:35,136 --> 01:12:37,124
Allez hup!

801
01:12:43,164 --> 01:12:45,136
Never mind.

802
01:12:55,108 --> 01:12:57,160
Here's a present from our friend Werner.

803
01:12:57,176 --> 01:12:59,132
Splendid.

804
01:12:59,152 --> 01:13:01,128
Simply splendid.

805
01:13:02,152 --> 01:13:04,148
This should do very nicely.

806
01:13:08,108 --> 01:13:09,160
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.

807
01:13:09,188 --> 01:13:13,172
He requested permission to dispose
of some of his dirt in our attic.

808
01:14:19,112 --> 01:14:23,108
Tom has reached just beyond
that pile of wood, sir.

809
01:14:23,136 --> 01:14:27,124
- Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.
- How much further to the trees?

810
01:14:27,168 --> 01:14:29,148
We make it 50 feet, sir.

811
01:14:29,168 --> 01:14:32,180
- Dark of the moon is the 7th...
- 8th and 9th.

812
01:14:32,196 --> 01:14:34,172
A day earlier in August.

813
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:42,156
Morning.

814
01:14:43,164 --> 01:14:45,156
There he goes again.

815
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,116
Why is he buying up all
the potatoes in the camp?

816
01:14:48,144 --> 01:14:51,100
I've been working on that,
but I can't find out.

817
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:53,144
Hilts and Hendley
lock themselves in every night.

818
01:14:53,176 --> 01:14:56,168
Sometimes Goff's with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.

819
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:00,172
Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry.
Seal them off.

820
01:15:00,184 --> 01:15:03,148
Put the entire effort into Tom
and press on into the trees.

821
01:15:03,172 --> 01:15:05,112
Right, Roger.

822
01:15:51,136 --> 01:15:52,168
Wow.

823
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,116
Wow.

824
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,136
Wow.

825
01:16:24,188 --> 01:16:26,136
Wow.

826
01:16:32,168 --> 01:16:34,116
Wow.

827
01:16:42,156 --> 01:16:43,188
Wow.

828
01:17:32,152 --> 01:17:33,148
About face!

829
01:17:34,868 --> 01:17:36,458
Forward march!

830
01:17:43,831 --> 01:17:46,580
- What is it?
- They're celebrating the revolution.

831
01:17:48,645 --> 01:17:49,615
It's the 4th of July.

832
01:17:58,939 --> 01:18:00,059
What the devil's this?

833
01:18:05,959 --> 01:18:08,320
Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks.

834
01:18:09,215 --> 01:18:10,389
- A little present from the colonials.
- Down the British.

835
01:18:11,261 --> 01:18:12,196
- Quite right too.
- And a little drink to Tom.

836
01:18:13,292 --> 01:18:14,367
And to getting home.

837
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:16,089
Very well. We accept.

838
01:18:17,134 --> 01:18:18,148
- Up the rebels!
- Down the British!

839
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:21,364
Gentlemen, follow us.

840
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:23,287
About face!

841
01:18:24,331 --> 01:18:24,994
Company, halt!

842
01:18:48,859 --> 01:18:49,719
All right, let's line up down here!

843
01:18:51,892 --> 01:18:53,079
All right, grab a cup!

844
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:55,821
Line it up! Here we go.

845
01:19:03,032 --> 01:19:04,319
That explains what happened
to the potatoes.

846
01:19:05,545 --> 01:19:07,012
No harm in closing down Tom
for one day, Roger.

847
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:10,169
I suppose it'll do us all good
to let off a bit of steam.

848
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:12,642
There's only 14 feet to go, sir, and you
can feel it throughout the whole camp.

849
01:19:15,045 --> 01:19:16,432
- I think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear.

850
01:19:18,528 --> 01:19:19,492
- Drink it up!
- What is this stuff, Hilts?

851
01:19:20,537 --> 01:19:21,387
Moonshine.
American moonshine. Moonshine.

852
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:24,449
Make my moustache grow. Cheers.

853
01:19:26,167 --> 01:19:27,385
Keep it moving.

854
01:19:28,981 --> 01:19:30,179
Hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.

855
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:32,103
- There you go.
- Down with the British.

856
01:19:33,146 --> 01:19:35,810
All right, old cobber. Keep it mo...

857
01:19:37,082 --> 01:19:38,522
- Don't get any on your clothes.
- Cheers!

858
01:19:40,056 --> 01:19:42,846
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?

859
01:19:44,372 --> 01:19:45,047
Keep it moving.

860
01:19:46,612 --> 01:19:47,552
Don't get any on your clothes, sir.

861
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:50,273
American moonshine.
Don't smoke right after you drink it.

862
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:52,881
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.

863
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:10,701
Get good and stoned, my friend.

864
01:20:13,136 --> 01:20:14,224
Keep it going. Keep it...

865
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:18,211
No taxation without representation.

866
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:20,404
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...

867
01:20:23,138 --> 01:20:24,899
Keep it going, fellas. Enjoy yourselves.

868
01:20:26,722 --> 01:20:27,482
Well, let's drink to Tom.

869
01:20:28,659 --> 01:20:29,208
To Tom.

870
01:20:36,272 --> 01:20:40,816
In the three years, seven months
and two weeks that I've been in the bag,

871
01:20:41,978 --> 01:20:42,531
that's the most extraordinary
stuff I've ever tasted.

872
01:20:44,117 --> 01:20:46,419
- It's shattering.
- Well, I think it's rather good.

873
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,257
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll all on kive.

874
01:20:54,632 --> 01:20:55,489
Call on Ives.

875
01:21:01,086 --> 01:21:01,839
Cheers, Hendley!

876
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,348
You know what that is?

877
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:18,375
I'll tell you what it isn't.

878
01:21:19,777 --> 01:21:20,947
It isn't Napoleon brandy.

879
01:21:23,828 --> 01:21:24,685
How do you like it, sir?

880
01:21:26,017 --> 01:21:27,221
Well, it's...

881
01:21:28,332 --> 01:21:29,033
To the colonies.

882
01:21:30,141 --> 01:21:31,048
Independence.

883
01:21:37,815 --> 01:21:40,544
How are you managing over there without
us? Getting along all right, are you?

884
01:21:41,831 --> 01:21:43,022
We seem to be getting along all right,
shir... sir.

885
01:21:52,249 --> 01:21:53,465
Yes, well, it's...

886
01:21:55,717 --> 01:21:57,038
It's good stuff, Hilts.

887
01:21:59,963 --> 01:22:00,809
Thank you, sir.

888
01:22:21,566 --> 01:22:22,908
Danny! Here's to...

889
01:22:30,586 --> 01:22:32,566
Roger, goons in 105.

890
01:22:34,059 --> 01:22:35,307
- Who?
- Strachwitz.

891
01:22:39,145 --> 01:22:41,155
We have to ignore it. If we pay attention,
the goons'll know the hut's important.

892
01:22:44,402 --> 01:22:45,709
Here's to going home.

893
01:23:00,585 --> 01:23:03,286
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.

894
01:23:04,182 --> 01:23:04,749
Home!

895
01:23:17,922 --> 01:23:21,013
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you
in the tunnel with us. To Tom, eh?

896
01:23:24,758 --> 01:23:27,260
Och, never mind. You'll be walking down
Argyle Street in a couple of weeks.

897
01:23:28,225 --> 01:23:32,708
To Tom. You know, Sandy,
I'm just beginning to realise that myself.

898
01:23:33,263 --> 01:23:34,834
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.

899
01:23:36,038 --> 01:23:36,751
We're nearly at the trees, eh?
