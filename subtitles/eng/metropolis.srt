2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,148
More than a quarter of the film
must be regarded as irretrievable, lost.

3
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:26,590
Few other films have been so
systematically changed, mutilated,

4
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:33,440
corrupted as this one. Shots and titles
have been omitted and changed

5
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:46,129
However, of no other such mistreated film
do we know so well

6
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:49,885
what the film originally looked like.

7
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:09,219
Fritz Lang and Thea von Harbou,
different-sex Siamese twins.

8
00:01:09,273 --> 00:01:13,012
Just like their film.

9
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:35,506
The novel: Thea von Harbou's film
behind the, under Fritz Lang's film.

10
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:59,242
At this point, the music started
during the first screening...

11
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:03,026
The Metropolis theme.

12
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:07,022
A fanfare motif...

13
00:02:07,383 --> 00:02:10,880
the orchestra follows...

14
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:14,773
a column of sound emerges.

15
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:26,765
Thea von Harbou's message,
Lang didn't believe in it.

16
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,717
He said: "I am fascinated by machines."

17
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:41,965
Metropolis, the mother city,
city of mothers, mother of all cities.

18
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:59,246
The city, the film...
they too are machines.

19
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:03,286
Flywheels,

20
00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:06,290
a crankshaft,

21
00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:10,237
an eccentric disk,

22
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:15,685
A machine without Workers,
devoid of function,

23
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:20,038
pure movement...
rotating, thrusting...

24
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:26,033
a machine of desire. Round shapes
and jerking movements become one

25
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:29,171
within the image of two clocks.

26
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:39,118
One 12-hour and one 10-hour clock.

27
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:58,013
Day shift and night shift, 10 hours each,
mark the Metropolis working day.

28
00:03:58,066 --> 00:04:02,855
Two groups of Workers,
uniformed, in rows of six,

29
00:04:03,312 --> 00:04:08,897
march in unison,
the exhausted half as fast as the fresh.

30
00:04:10,404 --> 00:04:16,591
"They moved their feet,
but were not walking", reads the novel.

31
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:22,946
The way people move or are moved
is always highly significant

32
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,735
throughout the film.

33
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,238
The Workers' theme - a funeral march.

34
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:03,565
The night shift enters a cage...

35
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:08,463
the grate is raised,

36
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:12,858
the cage sinks, and with it the camera.

37
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,805
A title picks up the movement.

38
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:32,853
"Even the titles", the young Luis Buñuel
wrote in his review of the film,

39
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:37,894
"how they rise and fall,
blend with the movement as a whole,

40
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:41,988
become pictures themselves."

41
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:47,388
The title's movement is carried through
to the movement of the picture.

42
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:52,690
The Workers: Now just a painted
silhouette rising in the background,

43
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:57,034
the design of the
Underground Workers' City.

44
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:03,423
Elevators transport the Workers
up and down between the machine halls

45
00:06:03,482 --> 00:06:08,071
and their living quarters.
A new musical theme:

46
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:12,175
The Theme of the City of the Workers.

47
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:32,760
The main square of the Workers' City.
Simply a transit area for the Workers

48
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:37,700
returning to their quarters.
In the centre a gong,

49
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:41,896
again a kind of alarm clock.

50
00:06:56,247 --> 00:07:01,490
The downward scroll of the title
is answered by a rising,

51
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:05,436
equilateral triangle pointing skywards.

52
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:20,669
The Sports stadium,

53
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:25,774
the contrast is stark between
its openness under sweeping skies

54
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:31,176
and the cramped City of the Workers -
just as stark as the contrast between

55
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:36,373
the liberated and carefree movements
of the youths, dressed in white,

56
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:41,412
and the dull lethargy
of the darkly clothed Workers -

57
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:46,459
and the self-determined horizontal
movement versus the downward ride

58
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:50,456
of the Workers in the lift.

59
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,795
A light-hearted waltz,
no musical leitmotiv,

60
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:12,291
accompanies this scene.
An artificial grotto,

61
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:18,342
columns like stalactites,
young women in rococo carnival costumes,

62
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,591
Orient-inspired head adornments.

63
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:42,181
The tricorn is of Venetian origin.

64
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:52,567
In contrast to the straight course
of the young men -

65
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:57,513
animated turns - anticlockwise -

66
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:01,366
directed by a ringmaster - clockwise.

67
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,144
A playground is the pleasure garden
of the sons, an infantile idyll.

68
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:36,530
Nature, sex,
eroticism in chaste playfulness -

69
00:09:36,594 --> 00:09:41,226
like the water in the fountain:
A transparent dome

70
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:45,030
masking a statue of a siren.

71
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:07,373
The youth in white breeches and the girl
with the Cul de Paris play hide and seek.

72
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:10,820
Their game a dance, a pas-de-deux.

73
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:21,660
Allusion, yet so intensely innocent

74
00:10:21,718 --> 00:10:26,251
that we do not actually expect
a real kiss.

75
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:30,500
Instead an expectant glance -

76
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:40,155
musically accompanied by a new theme,
let us call it the Love Theme...

77
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:05,237
answered by an apparition, "dressed in
light grey", it reads in the screenplay,

78
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:10,276
"from the smallest of décolletés
rises a head with solemn eyes

79
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:14,073
and glowing blonde hair".

80
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,616
"The austere countenance of the virgin,
the sweet countenance of the mother",

81
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:23,567
reads the novel.

82
00:11:27,877 --> 00:11:31,607
The mother without a man...
Freder's dream.

83
00:11:41,162 --> 00:11:44,857
New to the music is the Freder Theme,

84
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:51,360
it describes him as a light-hearted,
harmless soul - A pure fool.

85
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:58,000
The subject of her glance is Freder,
the brother, the son of Fredersen,

86
00:11:58,053 --> 00:12:05,348
the nothing-more-than-son. All names
in Metropolis are steeped in meaning.

87
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:22,078
Heralded by the clarinet -
a new chorale based theme,

88
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:28,629
which from now on will accompany
the entrances of the young woman.

89
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:14,697
A door closes,
communication is interrupted.

90
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,995
This will be repeated at several
decisive moments throughout the film,

91
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:27,546
providing the impetus for further action
on the part of its heros.

92
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,977
"Nothing could help him - nothing",
the novel states at this point.

93
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:51,180
"In a tortuous, ecstatic omnipresence
stood before his eyes the vision,

94
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:56,220
a countenance:
The austere countenance of the virgin,

95
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:59,976
the sweet countenance of the mother."

96
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:19,555
Later, we learn that Freder
lost his mother at birth.

97
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,939
Freder runs.

98
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:49,982
Where will Freder search for the virgin,
the mother?

99
00:14:53,738 --> 00:15:01,533
Not in the Workers' City, as one would
think. Freder arrives in a machine hall.

100
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,716
In this film, we can never be sure
whether what we see,

101
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:18,763
what the characters see,
actually represents reality

102
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:26,413
or is a hallucination, a vision, a dream
which sometimes becomes a nightmare.

103
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,406
Freder searches for a woman -
and finds a machine.

104
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:48,649
In the novel, he now comes face to face
with a machine of his own construction.

105
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:54,050
He strokes it, feels its limbs,
presses his face to its bulk.

106
00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:59,091
In the film, the machine is also
a living organism.

107
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:05,784
Freder in the novel: "Tonight I shall
allow myself to be embraced by you,

108
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:11,787
pour my life into you and discover
whether I can give you life."

109
00:16:11,842 --> 00:16:16,888
Blood pressure and temperature
of the film machine rise.

110
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:21,925
"Perhaps I will feel your trembling
and the sprouting of pulse

111
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:26,973
in your rigid body. Perhaps I shall
experience the intoxication

112
00:16:27,032 --> 00:16:32,375
with which you hurl yourself into
your vast element, bearing me,

113
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:36,165
the man who made you."

114
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:43,612
But Freder also knows,
Freder in the novel:

115
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:48,804
"Nothing in this world is more vengeful
than the jealousy of a machine

116
00:16:48,863 --> 00:16:52,602
that feels neglected."

117
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:04,850
In the film, the machine is called
the M Machine.

118
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:09,694
M as in mother?

119
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,392
M as in Moloch.
The Moloch theme -

120
00:17:19,098 --> 00:17:22,077
a threatening musical gesture.

121
00:17:34,884 --> 00:17:41,064
The film of the future is also a film
of Antiquity, a biblical film.

122
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:46,182
Moloch, the God of the Ammonites, to whom
the Israelites also sacrificed children,

123
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:52,017
to the chagrin of Moses and his God.
The film is littered with associations

124
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:56,313
to the Old and New Testaments.

125
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:25,145
In the music, the Moloch Theme switches
to the Theme of the Workers' City.

126
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:30,492
Platoons of Workers, in rows of six,
march into the mouth of Moloch,

127
00:18:30,553 --> 00:18:34,545
which transforms back into the machine.

128
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:57,228
A machine, which produces nothing,
which requires the tribute

129
00:18:57,286 --> 00:19:02,274
of the dead and injured -
like the bloody battles of the war,

130
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:07,819
which occurred only ten years before
the film was made.

131
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:44,234
Freder runs again...

132
00:20:12,282 --> 00:20:16,576
"Towering structures",
it says in the novel,

133
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:22,316
"packed together in blocks,
tower up either side of the streets -

134
00:20:22,374 --> 00:20:27,369
more like mountain ranges than homes,
stone cliffs interspersed

135
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:32,415
with glass-and-concrete buildings -
wide pavements rise above

136
00:20:32,474 --> 00:20:36,767
car-only streets -
and long-distance trains,

137
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:41,713
electrical express trains
intersect the streets,

138
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:45,855
aeroplanes hover..."
And in the background

139
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:50,549
"the New Tower of Babel,
towering above all."

140
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,883
In the music,
the Fredersen theme portrays him

141
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:27,481
as a self-confident autocrat.
Joh Fredersen, Joh with h -

142
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,726
Jehova
He is both monopolist and dictator.

143
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:43,769
In Thomas Pinchon's novel
"Gravity's Rainbow", Franz Pökler,

144
00:21:43,828 --> 00:21:48,517
a kind of Wernher von Braun,
remembers the film,

145
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:54,458
which he saw as a student in Berlin,
"Great movie." Exactly the world Pökler,

146
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:59,507
and evidently quite a few others,
were dreaming about,

147
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:04,850
a corporate City-State, in which
technology was the source of power,

148
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:10,198
and in which engineers worked closely
with administrators,

149
00:22:10,258 --> 00:22:15,940
and ultimate power
lay with a single leader at the top..."

150
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:42,080
No sooner had Freder entered this room,
according to Thea's novel,

151
00:22:42,138 --> 00:22:50,028
"than he was once again a boy of ten".
Nothing more than the son of this father.

152
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:02,669
The music, the Moloch theme, tells us
what Freder is speaking about.

153
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:19,009
The gestures of the son, unlike those of
the father, display trust, seek contact.

154
00:23:47,748 --> 00:23:53,431
Fredersen looks past him,
his gaze rests on the secretary.

155
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:14,519
Fredersen's glances are orders,
as are his words, his gestures.

156
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:55,387
Camera movements are rare in Metropolis
and are always significant.

157
00:24:55,449 --> 00:25:00,438
Here, the camera is guided
by the movements of the actors,

158
00:25:00,496 --> 00:25:05,782
the pace of the discussion
moves the camera, stops it,

159
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:11,783
moves it on...

160
00:25:12,942 --> 00:25:16,681
first it progresses...

161
00:25:23,332 --> 00:25:27,072
Then it pans with father and son.

162
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:26,883
It is in the children, not the adults,
that Freder recognises his siblings -

163
00:26:29,491 --> 00:26:33,785
himself as the infant prodigy
of the virgin,

164
00:26:34,188 --> 00:26:36,878
the motherly,

165
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,672
a kind of infant Jesus.

166
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:13,548
Fredersen is not only ruler
but also builder of Metropolis.

167
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:21,008
His city - an architectural dream,

168
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:26,052
a dazzling futuristic city,

169
00:27:26,106 --> 00:27:29,701
constructivist towering structures -

170
00:27:30,005 --> 00:27:34,991
as the urban crownof the New Tower of Babel.

171
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:26,265
First from the strings,
then the horns,

172
00:28:27,317 --> 00:28:32,602
allegro alla marcia,
the Theme of the Uprising begins.

173
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:11,982
A video telephone on the wall behind.

174
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:17,830
Fredersen's office is the control,
communication and command centre.

175
00:29:17,885 --> 00:29:22,172
His power is based on information.

176
00:29:55,006 --> 00:30:02,102
Above Fredersen on the wall, the lower
edge of the 10-hour clock is now visible.

177
00:30:02,156 --> 00:30:09,846
Fredersen's power lies in his ability
to control the time of his subordinates.

178
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:40,275
The Worker, the capitalist,

179
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:44,822
the clerk -
the model of modern class society.

180
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:13,897
The position of the seemingly
privileged employee is, in fact,

181
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:17,696
the most precarious.

182
00:32:24,013 --> 00:32:27,610
Again a door closes behind somebody,

183
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,146
this person's disappearance

184
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:37,055
motivating Freder to dedicate himself
to this person:

185
00:32:55,546 --> 00:33:00,534
"That people are consumed by
the machines", explains the father

186
00:33:00,592 --> 00:33:05,578
to the son in the novel, "does not prove
that the machines are greedy,

187
00:33:05,637 --> 00:33:10,625
but rather portrays the defective
material of the people themselves."

188
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:14,920
In industry as well as in war.

189
00:33:22,373 --> 00:33:26,114
Again, Freder runs.

190
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:30,970
For the father
the door closes behind him.

191
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,715
For the father
the door closes behind him.

192
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:18,881
Two rooms, two scenes,
screened in parallel,

193
00:34:18,936 --> 00:34:23,528
interrelated, contrasting,
the characters, too,

194
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:28,872
one commenting on the other -
here the staircase,

195
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:38,668
there Fredersen's office - this becomes
one of the film's narrative techniques.

196
00:35:03,612 --> 00:35:06,593
Freder has followed Josaphat -

197
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,887
Fredersen, on the other hand,
summons "The Slim One".

198
00:36:15,064 --> 00:36:18,599
Fredersen in right profile.

199
00:36:27,002 --> 00:36:32,744
The Slim One in left profile.
Take note of just how differently

200
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:36,140
Lang stages dialogue.

201
00:36:45,343 --> 00:36:50,528
Freder again heading downstairs
- "into the depths" -

202
00:37:03,783 --> 00:37:08,317
- and again in an act of viewing.

203
00:37:23,468 --> 00:37:28,853
Once again he is confronted with the
spectacle of a machine. In the novel,

204
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:33,903
it is called "the Paternoster machine"
- so let's keep it so -,

205
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:38,947
it keeps the elevator system
in the New Tower of Babel moving.

206
00:37:39,005 --> 00:37:45,603
In the film it has no obvious function,
it is purely metaphorical -

207
00:37:51,251 --> 00:37:54,989
an allegorical machine, if you like.

208
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:17,690
The change of clothing manifests
Freder's rebellion against the father.

209
00:39:23,887 --> 00:39:28,882
This is the beginning of the incarnation
of the son of Jehovah, his passion.

210
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:11,755
This cut is, up to now, the most serious
intervention carried out by the adaptors.

211
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:16,801
The critic Roland Schacht
praised the missing sequence:

212
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:21,845
Illusions similar to that
of the Yoshiwara pleasure palace,

213
00:40:21,904 --> 00:40:26,894
which distract Georgy from fulfilling
his task, have been used

214
00:40:26,952 --> 00:40:32,196
in French avant-garde films -
"but never to such tremendous,

215
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:37,137
synthetic, characteristic effect
as in this false,

216
00:40:37,294 --> 00:40:41,331
dazzling 'wax make-up' way".

217
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:51,670
In ancient times, reads the novel,
a magician from the Orient

218
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:55,473
built the house in seven days.

219
00:41:00,481 --> 00:41:04,473
Then, from a far distance
came Rotwang and,

220
00:41:04,526 --> 00:41:09,315
overcoming great resistance,
took it for his own.

221
00:41:13,274 --> 00:41:19,255
The Rotwang musical theme
is reminiscent of the Moloch music.

222
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:34,153
Fredersen is the only person in
Metropolis who respects Rotwang's genius.

223
00:41:52,547 --> 00:42:00,435
The removal of this figure is the gravest
manipulation executed by the adaptors.

224
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:05,630
The Hel of the Nordic sagas
was the ruler of the underworld,

225
00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:09,521
motherly Goddess of Death.

226
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:19,163
In Hel, Rotwang has lost his lover,

227
00:42:27,572 --> 00:42:30,416
Fredersen his wife,

228
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:38,266
Freder his mother - the loss inspires
each of them in their actions.

229
00:42:48,862 --> 00:42:52,457
How Lang stages a dramatic dialogue.

230
00:43:05,646 --> 00:43:08,846
Fredersen in right profile -

231
00:43:15,987 --> 00:43:20,081
Rotwang frontal,
eyes towards the camera -

232
00:43:22,238 --> 00:43:24,026
both,

233
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:31,723
Fredersen in right profile,
Rotwang in left profile.

234
00:43:43,022 --> 00:43:49,102
The audience alternating, at times
addressee, at times distanced observer.

235
00:44:15,054 --> 00:44:20,793
Curtain up for Rotwang's first scene,
the entry of the mechanical woman,

236
00:44:20,848 --> 00:44:23,890
the New Hel.

237
00:44:23,948 --> 00:44:28,341
On the wall a pentagram,
the magical symbol -

238
00:44:28,996 --> 00:44:33,685
the tip pointing downwards
suggests the satanic.

239
00:44:33,992 --> 00:44:39,035
A metallic phallus with female
physical attributes, with breasts

240
00:44:39,086 --> 00:44:44,670
and on the abdomen, mounted and
exhibited, the genitalia.

241
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:09,113
The music echoes the most important
components of the Mechanical Woman Theme.

242
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:15,211
It comprises three motifs, attributed
to the various aspects of the being,

243
00:45:15,267 --> 00:45:20,850
and which at times appear separately,
at times in unison.

244
00:46:32,515 --> 00:46:37,501
Rotwang's artificial limb is steel,
steel from the steel of the creature

245
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:41,299
to whom he sacrificed his hand.

246
00:47:17,788 --> 00:47:22,974
Another parallel scene -
Freder still at the machine,

247
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:29,219
Fredersen with Rotwang -
determines the next sequence.

248
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:05,595
The plan... Fredersen's copy

249
00:48:15,998 --> 00:48:20,191
and the one which Freder finds...

250
00:48:21,046 --> 00:48:26,032
acts as the pivot between
both strands of the plot.

251
00:49:13,908 --> 00:49:17,648
Rotwang's library
- Ancient tomes -

252
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:24,795
and a neon spiral lamp - Rotwang caught
between Middle Ages and future -

253
00:49:26,354 --> 00:49:31,795
Fredersen in contrast,
with a Chronomètre Movado on his wrist,

254
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:35,545
is the epitome of twenties modernity.

255
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:34,648
Freder's Passion
- the factory is his Golgotha -

256
00:50:35,007 --> 00:50:40,690
his cross the clock,
the Father-God's instrument of power.

257
00:52:42,573 --> 00:52:46,273
The omnipotent is not omniscient.

258
00:52:46,523 --> 00:52:52,803
Lack of information is the motivation
for Fredersen's departure.

259
00:53:00,664 --> 00:53:05,610
For the first time we see him
physically in motion,

260
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:10,194
moving from one scene to another.

261
00:53:47,735 --> 00:53:52,821
Fredersen and Rotwang descend
- from right to left -

262
00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:00,820
left-right the Workers
- Freder between them -

263
00:54:06,823 --> 00:54:11,016
both groups heading towards
the same scene.

264
00:54:41,297 --> 00:54:46,284
Freder, hand on heart again
- the Love Theme from the garden scene

265
00:54:46,342 --> 00:54:50,635
in the background -,
sees "a type of crypt",

266
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:57,637
it states in the screenplay,
with "eight or ten tall, rough crosses,

267
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:01,422
but no crucifix.

268
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:08,779
Countless niches in the walls, the bones
and skulls of thousands of departed

269
00:55:08,831 --> 00:55:11,916
barely visible in the shadows."

270
00:55:14,926 --> 00:55:20,814
A mixture of early Christian place
of worship (Sienkiewicz's Quo Vadis

271
00:55:20,876 --> 00:55:26,161
had just been filmed with Emil Jannings)
And pagan underworld

272
00:55:26,221 --> 00:55:32,302
is the place where Freder meets
the Virgin, the mother, again.

273
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:41,198
"Look at me, Virgin, his eyes prayed",
it says in the novel,

274
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:44,999
"Mother, look at me"

275
00:55:56,549 --> 00:56:01,733
Both strands of the plot intertwine
in Rotwang's and Fredersen's

276
00:56:01,795 --> 00:56:05,733
glance down into the crypt.

277
00:56:06,142 --> 00:56:10,236
They do not recognise
Freder in the scene.

278
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:28,778
The preacher is reciting a screenplay,

279
00:56:43,471 --> 00:56:47,266
which Freder turns into a film for us.

280
00:56:53,113 --> 00:56:57,308
The Creative Man, priest,
ruler, architect.

281
00:56:59,954 --> 00:57:07,051
Accompanied by the music, played during
the opening credits of the film.

282
00:57:23,947 --> 00:57:28,935
What here looks like a mammoth
construction in panoramic shot

283
00:57:28,994 --> 00:57:36,180
turns out to be a model, around which
a group of architects has gathered.

284
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:46,114
New to the music:
The Tower of Babel Theme.

285
00:58:12,412 --> 00:58:17,402
Five groups of Workers, a metaphor:
Like the fingers on a hand.

286
00:59:53,644 --> 00:59:58,831
End of the simile, the sermon,
end of the projection.

287
01:00:06,489 --> 01:00:10,982
A look into the camera,
into our eyes.

288
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:24,869
The epigram.
This is awarded its own musical motif.

289
01:01:05,346 --> 01:01:09,086
Thus we learn her name.

290
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:14,233
In the novel Freder asks:
"What should I call you?"

291
01:01:14,292 --> 01:01:18,232
She answers: "Mary." He answers:

292
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:23,376
"Only this can be your name."

293
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:53,261
Allegro alla marcia:
The Theme of the Uprising.

294
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:07,454
Fredersen believes he has seen enough.

295
01:02:29,745 --> 01:02:35,982
What Rotwang sees, however, and wants
to prevent Fredersen from seeing,

296
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:40,529
because a new plan
is germinating in his mind:

297
01:02:46,837 --> 01:02:52,620
A dialogue is opening.
Freder's gaze is searching for Mary.

298
01:02:53,578 --> 01:02:57,320
His hand beckons her,

299
01:03:06,122 --> 01:03:09,863
he begins to speak,

300
01:03:15,219 --> 01:03:18,653
his eyes follow her,

301
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:25,113
the camera assumes his gaze,
which become one with her movements,

302
01:03:32,803 --> 01:03:38,394
scans her gaze,
sweeps her gaze directly into the camera,

303
01:03:42,197 --> 01:03:45,933
moving gently to him,

304
01:03:47,143 --> 01:03:53,545
unites both in the picture...
the speaker always in semi-profile,

305
01:03:53,793 --> 01:03:57,390
the listener laterally from behind.

306
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:22,515
An erotic dialogue,
regardless of what the titles say.

307
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:35,606
The Love Theme is playing

308
01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:44,556
- now stops -

309
01:04:44,611 --> 01:04:49,599
and is replaced by
the Rotwang and Fredersen Themes

310
01:04:49,658 --> 01:04:53,390
in accentuated variations.

311
01:05:32,379 --> 01:05:38,659
The couple is musically threatened
by the Theme of the Uprising.

312
01:06:20,999 --> 01:06:25,788
Will Rotwang give up his project
to recreate Hel,

313
01:06:26,043 --> 01:06:33,536
or will he extend it, if it can be used
to steal his rival's son from him...

314
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,020
the son of Hel,

315
01:06:49,878 --> 01:06:53,177
who he himself expected from her?

316
01:08:46,654 --> 01:08:51,741
Mary's light is candlelight,
natural, soft like her.

317
01:10:14,742 --> 01:10:18,440
The realm of death, the realm of Hel.

318
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:23,930
Is Freder's dead mother jealous
of her son's love,

319
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:28,777
is this why she joins forces
with her destroyer?

320
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:00,509
Rotwang's lamp is a mechanical tool,
like his steel hand,

321
01:11:00,567 --> 01:11:04,760
the entire man
a hybrid of man and machine.

322
01:11:05,564 --> 01:11:11,842
Lucifer, "the bringer of light",
is one of the Evil One's names.

323
01:11:19,903 --> 01:11:24,847
He showed this scene to a
Hollywood specialist, wrote Lang.

324
01:11:24,898 --> 01:11:29,886
"This beam of light which impales
the prey on a sharp needle,

325
01:11:29,944 --> 01:11:34,933
refuses to release it, driving it
before him in relentless pursuit,

326
01:11:34,992 --> 01:11:40,577
onwards into a state of abject panic,
caused the mild-mannered American

327
01:11:40,637 --> 01:11:46,825
to confess naively: 'We can't do this'
They could do it", said Lang,

328
01:11:46,888 --> 01:11:52,231
"they just did not think of it", and:
"Light and shadow should not only

329
01:11:52,283 --> 01:11:59,966
be used to convey a mood, but should
also play a decisive role in the action."

330
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:06,930
The cathedral:
A second piece of the Middle Ages

331
01:13:07,287 --> 01:13:12,273
"Mysticism, gothic, grandeur,

332
01:13:12,331 --> 01:13:16,824
ceremony, incense",
it says in the screenplay,

333
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:22,217
"in the centre of the scene,
a column reaching towards the heavens

334
01:13:22,275 --> 01:13:27,264
like the trunk of a palm." In the novel
the cathedral harbours a fanatical sect,

335
01:13:27,323 --> 01:13:32,905
the Gothics, who persistently
offer Fredersen resistance.

336
01:13:59,302 --> 01:14:05,893
The adaptors of the film reduced
this strand of the plot even more.

337
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:30,320
Again, a parallel action which interferes
in the current action,

338
01:14:30,378 --> 01:14:34,613
transforms it into a fantasia.

339
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:49,757
The music in the cathedral scene:
The "Dies irae",

340
01:14:49,915 --> 01:14:53,808
musical epitome for death and disaster.

341
01:14:54,112 --> 01:14:59,102
In the original version of the film,
the musical leitmotif is intertwined

342
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:06,157
with the memory of the penitential
sermon of the monk at the cathedral.

343
01:16:11,816 --> 01:16:17,402
This is the longest piece
to have been cut from the film.

344
01:17:44,854 --> 01:17:48,252
The story of Freder, the good boy,

345
01:17:49,948 --> 01:17:54,937
Rotwang, the sorcerer and the abducted
Mary gives Metropolis

346
01:17:54,995 --> 01:18:00,586
the air of a fairytale
in a particularly unambiguous way.

347
01:18:29,178 --> 01:18:34,566
Many fairytales are based on
the abduction of a person.

348
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:48,258
The evil character
captures or imprisons someone,

349
01:18:48,317 --> 01:18:52,409
he foists another person
onto this person,

350
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:59,706
he transforms the person into another or
presents another person as the captive...

351
01:18:59,755 --> 01:19:03,253
as Rotwang intends to do with Mary.

352
01:19:04,502 --> 01:19:08,838
The hero, searching for the object
or person he is missing,

353
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:13,888
reaches the place
where the captive is being held.

354
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:32,159
The hero, the searcher is shown the way.

355
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:21,403
"Like the trail of a scent",
says the novel,

356
01:20:21,509 --> 01:20:26,305
"the glow in front of him
led him up the stairs."

357
01:20:51,486 --> 01:20:57,075
The old house sucks Freder in,
it makes him its prisoner,

358
01:20:57,438 --> 01:21:01,580
it draws him into the depths.

359
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:48,377
The machinery of the old house is like
a model of the narrative mechanism,

360
01:21:48,435 --> 01:21:52,734
which keeps both
hero and audience moving...

361
01:21:53,737 --> 01:22:00,146
always being shown something,
before it quickly disappears again.

362
01:22:37,178 --> 01:22:41,320
Another sign... Mary's scarf.

363
01:23:22,569 --> 01:23:29,072
And once again Freder's call for
the virgin, the mother is answered by...

364
01:23:33,778 --> 01:23:37,519
a vision, a staging.

365
01:24:13,936 --> 01:24:18,933
An earlier concept for the film
presented medieval and modern ages

366
01:24:18,990 --> 01:24:23,289
in different forms.
"Mrs. Von Harbou and l",

367
01:24:24,043 --> 01:24:29,794
remembers Lang forty years later,
"included a battle between modern science

368
01:24:29,847 --> 01:24:35,301
and occultism in the screenplay,
the sorcerer was the evil force

369
01:24:35,355 --> 01:24:42,156
behind all events" - but they deviated,
Lang says, from this concept.

370
01:24:46,362 --> 01:24:49,251
Although not entirely:

371
01:24:49,316 --> 01:24:54,312
"Centuries behind, centuries ahead",
it says in the screenplay,

372
01:24:54,371 --> 01:25:00,560
Rotwang's laboratory was "half a quack's
kitchen from the year 1500

373
01:25:00,623 --> 01:25:06,619
and half experimental laboratory
of a man from the year 2000."

374
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:12,828
In Rotwang's character Harbou and Lang
merged both magic and modernity

375
01:25:12,885 --> 01:25:19,393
in one entity. A hermaphrodite,
like the film in which he appears.

376
01:25:19,994 --> 01:25:24,986
That could have been conceived and
staged by him, just like the transformation

377
01:25:25,045 --> 01:25:29,644
of the mechanical woman
into the image of Mary.

378
01:25:36,059 --> 01:25:41,407
His staging combines both feminine
and masculine form and movement,

379
01:25:41,459 --> 01:25:45,161
translated into a spectacle of light.

380
01:25:45,413 --> 01:25:49,114
A Luciferic act of procreation.

381
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:56,669
Rotwang endows his machine
with Mary's attributes...

382
01:25:56,727 --> 01:26:01,718
but he also allows the feminine
sexuality, which is repressed

383
01:26:01,778 --> 01:26:06,876
in the figure of the virgin-mother,
to be unleashed in the double.

384
01:26:06,935 --> 01:26:11,929
The chaste Mary, the white and merciful,
the virgin,

385
01:26:11,989 --> 01:26:16,188
and the hot, destructive,
the red, the vamp

386
01:26:16,545 --> 01:26:20,344
are two aspects of the same character.

387
01:26:37,412 --> 01:26:42,406
Rotwang's experimental table,
with Mary as Snow White waiting

388
01:26:42,463 --> 01:26:47,461
in her glass coffin to be awakened,
can be seen as the couch

389
01:26:47,518 --> 01:26:52,714
of Rotwang the psychoanalyst.
Her subconscious manifests itself

390
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:59,576
in the arcs of light stretching
between her and the mechanical woman.

391
01:27:38,267 --> 01:27:45,067
Freder, like awakening from a nightmare,
sees himself in another one.

392
01:27:58,132 --> 01:28:02,931
Hel's room...
her memorial is behind the curtain.

393
01:28:25,254 --> 01:28:29,055
Mary's Theme, agitato, in a minor key.

394
01:28:57,384 --> 01:29:02,338
The false Mary,
flesh of the flesh of the true Mary,

395
01:29:02,389 --> 01:29:08,583
while at the same time
a remote-controlled machine at the core.

396
01:29:21,705 --> 01:29:26,858
Why is Fredersen so doggedly determined,
to destroy the true Mary?

397
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:43,473
In the figure of the merciful preacher,
he seems to sense a female challenge

398
01:29:43,526 --> 01:29:50,428
- that of matriarchy - to his patriarchal
principle of absolute power.

399
01:29:52,536 --> 01:29:56,577
Freder's Oedipus experience.

400
01:30:08,297 --> 01:30:14,545
The shock causes Freder to see father
and mother - whom he images as Mary -

401
01:30:14,601 --> 01:30:21,009
rotating around each other. At this point
in the novel Freder chokes his father:

402
01:30:21,059 --> 01:30:26,057
"I want to kill you I want to
destroy you I want to murder you"

403
01:30:26,115 --> 01:30:30,964
In the film, a fall
- "downwards, into the depth" -

404
01:30:31,016 --> 01:30:34,521
into the chasm of his subconscious.

405
01:30:39,874 --> 01:30:43,019
Freder in bed,

406
01:30:43,177 --> 01:30:48,129
the father in tails.
An obvious feeling of helplessness

407
01:30:48,183 --> 01:30:52,382
in front of his father's
aura of authority.

408
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:59,681
The son remains in the care of the,
in part female, staff.

409
01:30:59,741 --> 01:31:03,046
A sick child.

410
01:31:49,686 --> 01:31:55,782
Freder's unconscious state
again fades into a Rotwang staging.

411
01:32:01,546 --> 01:32:06,544
Can it be that Freder and Rotwang
are not so much rivals

412
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:12,649
as the alter egos of each other?
They love the same woman, the dead Hel.

413
01:32:12,706 --> 01:32:17,702
The absence of the mother,
the lover provides the inspiration

414
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:23,657
for Freder's visions just as much as
for Rotwang's stagings.

415
01:32:28,724 --> 01:32:33,717
Rotwang's audience consists
entirely of men, old and young,

416
01:32:33,775 --> 01:32:36,982
fathers and sons.

417
01:32:42,032 --> 01:32:46,630
"Like a blasphemous halo",
says the screenplay,

418
01:32:47,036 --> 01:32:54,938
the diadem on the woman's head appears
in the round opening of the domed roof...

419
01:32:58,297 --> 01:33:02,298
that fades out. Rotwang's show is a film,

420
01:33:04,455 --> 01:33:10,699
another of Rotwang's light productions,
with footlights and counter lighting.

421
01:33:31,728 --> 01:33:36,424
Rotwang's show and Freder's delirium
become one.

422
01:33:41,189 --> 01:33:46,143
An important strand in this mesh,
Freder's reminiscence

423
01:33:46,191 --> 01:33:53,395
of the monk's sermon in the cathedral,
has again been cut by the adaptors.

424
01:34:21,874 --> 01:34:27,762
Diverges from the action which was shown:

425
01:34:27,825 --> 01:34:32,823
Isolated, edited gestures
and the positions of the dancer,

426
01:34:32,882 --> 01:34:36,623
combined with the picture
of the audience

427
01:34:36,683 --> 01:34:40,483
- groups, singles, only eyes finally -

428
01:34:41,239 --> 01:34:47,033
Rotwang's production becomes Lang's...
pure montage cinema.

429
01:35:29,131 --> 01:35:34,126
Rotwang's show
now clearly becomes Freder's vision,

430
01:35:37,587 --> 01:35:42,784
the memory of the seven deadly sins
in the cathedral,

431
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:51,538
of the monk's sermon
on the Whore of Babylon,

432
01:35:51,601 --> 01:35:56,657
which he associates with the image
of the false Mary, the New Hel,

433
01:35:56,708 --> 01:36:00,450
the mother-whore...

434
01:36:06,013 --> 01:36:12,208
which becomes one with that
of the Metropolis, the Mother City.

435
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:03,258
Freder, convalescent, is reading.

436
01:37:04,668 --> 01:37:10,656
A copy of the page which was shown
at this point in the film.

437
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:54,210
Again, two parallel scenes, the second
once more cut by the adaptors.

438
01:37:54,411 --> 01:37:58,412
The spy reports to the father,

439
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:03,159
the friend to the son.

440
01:38:12,325 --> 01:38:17,322
Nothing remains of this scene,
but screenplay and score

441
01:38:17,381 --> 01:38:22,375
lead to the assumption
that these takes were repeated here.

442
01:39:17,531 --> 01:39:22,529
Only very few of the Yoshiwara takes
have remained intact,

443
01:39:22,588 --> 01:39:26,385
this one in a copy found in Australia,

444
01:39:26,991 --> 01:39:33,693
incomplete, the end is missing,
as one of the sons shoots the other.

445
01:40:54,270 --> 01:40:58,312
Freder and Josaphat set off,

446
01:41:00,725 --> 01:41:03,926
Fredersen gives Slim an order...

447
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:13,275
A third reporting situation
is blended in after the other two.

448
01:41:27,997 --> 01:41:31,741
Rotwang tells Mary.

449
01:41:55,874 --> 01:41:59,618
Included in his report,

450
01:42:01,227 --> 01:42:07,877
as a parallel action, is the activity
about which Rotwang is speaking.

451
01:42:07,936 --> 01:42:12,277
Like the group of rich sons
in the dancehall,

452
01:42:12,341 --> 01:42:19,939
the group of Workers in the catacombs,
too, fall under the spell of the vamp.

453
01:42:54,074 --> 01:42:59,526
Like the evil character in a fairy tale,
Rotwang pretends his own child

454
01:42:59,581 --> 01:43:03,323
to be the one he keeps as a prisoner.

455
01:44:09,291 --> 01:44:14,033
Ufa regarded the "red" Mary's speech
as "inciting"

456
01:44:14,097 --> 01:44:20,287
and ordered a milder form for
the second version. Instead of...

457
01:44:20,351 --> 01:44:25,305
the title became:
"Who wants to work himself to death

458
01:44:25,357 --> 01:44:29,596
for the rulers of Metropolis?"

459
01:44:30,510 --> 01:44:33,399
Instead of...

460
01:44:33,813 --> 01:44:39,108
"Who is the life force
of the machines of Metropolis?"

461
01:44:55,686 --> 01:44:58,173
Instead of...

462
01:44:58,236 --> 01:45:05,037
in the revised version it became:
"Who are the slaves of Metropolis?"

463
01:45:10,697 --> 01:45:13,442
And for...

464
01:45:14,098 --> 01:45:18,398
the false Mary had to say:
"Let them rot..."

465
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:44,321
Freder, who only had visions before,
has gained a critical, perceiving view.

466
01:45:51,533 --> 01:45:55,276
He sees through the double.

467
01:47:33,272 --> 01:47:38,269
The adaptors found the construction with
Rotwang's report as the framework

468
01:47:38,328 --> 01:47:43,320
around the second catacomb scene
too complicated.

469
01:48:27,873 --> 01:48:32,822
Georgy's martyrdom not only seals
Freder's new role

470
01:48:32,872 --> 01:48:38,170
as a critical perceiver,
but also shows him as a future saviour,

471
01:48:38,229 --> 01:48:41,972
as a new Messiah.

472
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:16,464
The central square of the Workers' City
has become a stage

473
01:49:16,516 --> 01:49:20,358
in the theatre of the revolution.

474
01:49:26,771 --> 01:49:31,827
The first beats of the Marseillaise.
Not only the music is imbued

475
01:49:31,878 --> 01:49:36,874
with the character of a citation.
The way the false Mary whips the crowd

476
01:49:36,933 --> 01:49:42,324
into a frenzy corresponds to her
performance in front of the rich sons.

477
01:49:42,384 --> 01:49:47,381
The gong podium is a tribune for the
performance in which not only she

478
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:51,184
takes part but an ecstatic ensemble.

479
01:50:08,712 --> 01:50:14,001
The elevators. Earlier we saw the night
shift advancing into the elevators

480
01:50:14,062 --> 01:50:19,058
for transportation into the depths...
now they are being stormed

481
01:50:19,117 --> 01:50:24,172
by men and women, who use them
to go upwards. In a later scene,

482
01:50:24,224 --> 01:50:32,122
the movement accelerated and reversed,
we will see them - empty - crashing down.

483
01:50:50,945 --> 01:50:55,941
In the beginning only men were
present here, now we see women,

484
01:50:55,999 --> 01:50:59,501
the workers' wives, female workers.

485
01:50:59,804 --> 01:51:04,799
The face of the repressed masses
"was male; only with the uprising,"

486
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:10,854
unleashed, does this face obtain female
traits, does its female base appear,

487
01:51:10,916 --> 01:51:16,406
hitherto oppressed by organisation,
control, discipline.

488
01:51:18,021 --> 01:51:22,119
Again the same venues
as in the beginning,

489
01:51:22,426 --> 01:51:27,423
in reverse order and viewing direction.
At the start the Workers,

490
01:51:27,476 --> 01:51:32,929
silently waiting for the raising
of the grating - now the unleashed mass,

491
01:51:32,984 --> 01:51:38,080
men and women,
deliriously determined to blow it up.

492
01:52:15,922 --> 01:52:22,015
The children, abandoned by their
biological fathers and mothers,

493
01:52:22,078 --> 01:52:28,778
offered for adoption by Mary,
the maternal, and Freder, the brother.

494
01:53:15,374 --> 01:53:19,119
Again two people,

495
01:53:20,227 --> 01:53:23,672
two venues, alternating,

496
01:53:23,732 --> 01:53:29,427
audio-visually bound by the
video-telephone in Fredersen's office,

497
01:53:29,489 --> 01:53:34,582
control and command tool
of the ruler of Metropolis.

498
01:53:41,798 --> 01:53:45,542
Subordinate and superior.

499
01:54:32,141 --> 01:54:39,442
Back to the sounds of the Marseillaise,
the storming of the Heart Machine.

500
01:55:09,725 --> 01:55:13,524
The two Marys, now in parallel action:

501
01:55:14,029 --> 01:55:21,131
The true, the white, finally free
to continue her reconciliation work...

502
01:55:29,492 --> 01:55:36,000
and the false, the red, the force
behind uprising and destruction.

503
01:55:52,014 --> 01:55:56,214
Mary on her way
to the City of the Workers,

504
01:55:57,065 --> 01:56:02,061
to save the children abandoned
by their fathers and mothers.

505
01:56:10,829 --> 01:56:15,783
Like a counter-manoeuvre
to her own creation by Rotwang,

506
01:56:15,836 --> 01:56:21,188
as a light show, electric pyrotechnic
sorcery, the false Mary instigates

507
01:56:21,241 --> 01:56:25,140
the destruction of the Heart Machine...

508
01:56:32,150 --> 01:56:36,548
before leaving the stage
via a back stairway,

509
01:56:36,704 --> 01:56:41,696
a shadow ascending a staircase,
exit to another theatre,

510
01:56:41,754 --> 01:56:45,658
another audience, the sons of the rich.

511
01:57:01,326 --> 01:57:06,318
Arm movements as though in parody
of the rotating of the disk,

512
01:57:06,377 --> 01:57:12,571
still identifying with the machine
even during its destruction.

513
01:57:51,819 --> 01:57:56,415
The elevators now finally descending,
plunging.

514
01:58:25,499 --> 01:58:29,797
The water. "It was said",
records the novel,

515
01:58:30,503 --> 01:58:35,502
"deep under the city there wanders
a stream." Joh Fredersen constructed

516
01:58:35,561 --> 01:58:40,709
a path for the stream when he built
the City of the Workers.

517
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:45,913
"It was also said that the stream
was feeding a large reservoir

518
01:58:45,966 --> 01:58:51,221
and that there was a pumping station
there, powerful enough, to fill or empty

519
01:58:51,273 --> 01:58:54,974
the reservoir in less than 10 hours."

520
01:58:55,277 --> 01:59:00,274
The subterranean streams had been
channelled, disciplined,

521
01:59:00,331 --> 01:59:05,324
obstructed by Fredersen and coupled
to the machines - as had the people.

522
01:59:05,382 --> 01:59:12,389
Now the unleashed waters of the depths
join the uprising of the humans.

523
01:59:16,741 --> 01:59:21,894
We have seen Rotwang working the levers
in his laboratory and the other Mary

524
01:59:21,947 --> 01:59:26,944
working the levers of the Heart Machine.
Now she is moving the levers

525
01:59:27,003 --> 01:59:32,299
of the gong machine.
The gong podium, the alarm clock,

526
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:38,862
the tribune hosting the revolt,
is now used to save the children.

527
02:00:02,232 --> 02:00:07,030
The square fills with the water
and the children.

528
02:00:07,239 --> 02:00:12,192
It is almost as if the children
are involved in the flood,

529
02:00:12,243 --> 02:00:17,198
even though their own lives are
in danger, as if they perceive

530
02:00:17,248 --> 02:00:22,242
the absence of adults and breaching
of the banks as a liberation.

531
02:01:49,981 --> 02:01:54,977
The upper city too has been robbed
of electric light through

532
02:01:55,035 --> 02:02:00,028
the destruction of the Heart Machine,
causing Fredersen to reach for

533
02:02:00,086 --> 02:02:04,427
his flashlight...
to receive Slim in its glow.

534
02:03:20,312 --> 02:03:23,555
No more doubt:

535
02:03:31,568 --> 02:03:35,314
A couple of lovers...

536
02:03:46,981 --> 02:03:50,881
but more like a couple of parents,

537
02:03:50,935 --> 02:03:56,532
without act of procreation,
through adoption, by saving the children,

538
02:03:56,590 --> 02:04:00,392
abandoned by their biological parents.

539
02:04:12,505 --> 02:04:16,249
Not just a couple, but three, a trinity,

540
02:04:16,308 --> 02:04:22,303
of which there soon will be more,
with interchanging members.

541
02:04:29,070 --> 02:04:34,068
They take care of the children,
the innocent offspring of the Workers,

542
02:04:34,126 --> 02:04:37,926
who have refused to be rescued by them.

543
02:05:40,984 --> 02:05:45,081
A last climb through the airshaft
from the depths of the Workers' City

544
02:05:45,136 --> 02:05:48,879
to the Club of the Sons.

545
02:05:58,548 --> 02:06:03,503
The flying camera simulates
the pressure of the explosion

546
02:06:03,555 --> 02:06:07,555
which rocks the city to its foundations.

547
02:06:53,650 --> 02:06:56,338
Finale with Mary's theme...

548
02:07:04,008 --> 02:07:07,453
general pause...

549
02:07:10,361 --> 02:07:14,659
then again the Theme of the Uprising,
men and women dancing in two

550
02:07:14,714 --> 02:07:22,913
concentric circles, as though still under
the spell of the machines they destroyed.

551
02:07:28,029 --> 02:07:33,024
Four, actually five venues and actions
with various characters

552
02:07:33,083 --> 02:07:36,827
are now interconnected:

553
02:07:44,793 --> 02:07:47,283
Fredersen's office...

554
02:07:56,454 --> 02:07:58,947
Fredersen, Slim...

555
02:08:02,610 --> 02:08:08,301
then the machine hall
with the destroyed Moloch machine...

556
02:09:24,829 --> 02:09:28,633
This question is musically answered...

557
02:09:33,739 --> 02:09:38,734
by a motif from the
Mechanical Woman's Theme.

558
02:09:45,498 --> 02:09:50,751
Thirdly, the Yoshiwara,
where - to a foxtrot - the false Mary

559
02:09:50,805 --> 02:09:55,800
leads the sons of the rich
to dance on the volcano.

560
02:10:30,289 --> 02:10:34,288
The Workers abandon the scene of action.

561
02:10:54,660 --> 02:10:59,258
Fourthly, the entrance
of the Club of the Sons,

562
02:11:03,116 --> 02:11:09,526
with Freder. Here, a shot with Mary
has been cut by the adaptors.

563
02:11:11,875 --> 02:11:15,276
And the children.

564
02:11:15,828 --> 02:11:20,169
A square beneath this one,
which the Workers,

565
02:11:20,233 --> 02:11:24,831
ascending from the machine halls,
have reached.

566
02:11:36,346 --> 02:11:40,788
And finally, fifthly,
Rotwang's attic room,

567
02:11:40,852 --> 02:11:45,648
where Fredersen's down and out
opponent recovers.

568
02:12:58,372 --> 02:13:03,523
This plot of interwoven strands again
proved too complicated for the adaptors,

569
02:13:03,574 --> 02:13:07,319
they rearranged, they condensed.

570
02:13:32,553 --> 02:13:37,548
They edited the film, giving the
impression that the false Mary

571
02:13:37,608 --> 02:13:44,211
is the only victim of the witch-hunt
and that the true Mary is in no danger.

572
02:13:44,261 --> 02:13:49,856
By readjusting this shot
the true Mary becomes the other.

573
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:11,880
Only when you carefully look,
you see - here -

574
02:14:12,286 --> 02:14:17,982
Mary running across the screen
escaping from her pursuers,

575
02:14:18,444 --> 02:14:22,244
who manage to couple her double.

576
02:14:51,318 --> 02:14:57,925
Fittingly, the Workers construct
a stake in front of the cathedral.

577
02:15:03,034 --> 02:15:07,825
The stake is made from metal,
the wrecks of cars,

578
02:15:08,033 --> 02:15:12,033
partly with their headlights
illuminated.

579
02:15:27,004 --> 02:15:31,046
The false Mary tied to the stake.

580
02:15:31,357 --> 02:15:37,146
She who was created by electrical sparks,
totally in her element,

581
02:15:37,209 --> 02:15:41,109
in a display of masochistic lust.

582
02:16:05,084 --> 02:16:08,826
Josaphat and Freder separated.

583
02:16:54,028 --> 02:16:58,226
Rotwang had awakened,
it says in the novel,

584
02:16:58,381 --> 02:17:03,077
"but he knew he had died.
And this realisation filled him

585
02:17:03,136 --> 02:17:08,135
with the deepest satisfaction.
He only wanted his Hel.

586
02:17:08,192 --> 02:17:13,189
Upon finding Hel he would no longer
have reason to quarrel

587
02:17:13,247 --> 02:17:15,735
with anything on earth."

588
02:17:20,954 --> 02:17:25,552
"Hel", he says in the novel.
"I am not a ghost,

589
02:17:25,958 --> 02:17:30,952
although I have died,
I had to die to come to you."

590
02:17:39,568 --> 02:17:45,063
Mary, the virgin, and her double,
both in mortal danger,

591
02:17:45,325 --> 02:17:49,068
a mirror image in one scene.

592
02:17:52,479 --> 02:17:57,335
The red Mary at the stake,
the white in the cathedral,

593
02:17:57,385 --> 02:18:01,129
pursued by Rotwang.

594
02:18:22,709 --> 02:18:27,108
The bells of the cathedral
come to her aid...

595
02:18:30,916 --> 02:18:34,659
beckoning the saviour,

596
02:18:35,472 --> 02:18:39,570
like the gong before
in the Workers' City.

597
02:18:57,135 --> 02:19:02,631
As Freder watches, the fire burns away
the flesh of the false Mary

598
02:19:02,693 --> 02:19:06,437
revealing her mechanical core,

599
02:19:06,797 --> 02:19:11,993
musically triumphant, accompanied by
one of the Mechanical Woman motifs

600
02:19:12,051 --> 02:19:15,695
in vibrant major.

601
02:19:27,264 --> 02:19:32,262
The scene on the cathedral roof
is reminiscent of Victor Hugo's

602
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:40,022
"Hunchback of Notre Dame". The novel had
recently been filmed with Lon Chaney.

603
02:19:41,125 --> 02:19:45,125
An unmistakable reference:
The gargoyles.

604
02:19:52,238 --> 02:19:57,192
After the demise of the evil
half of the female double pair,

605
02:19:57,238 --> 02:20:00,985
the final battle between
the two male rivals

606
02:20:01,045 --> 02:20:05,046
is enacted on the roof of the cathedral.

607
02:20:15,306 --> 02:20:20,760
Freder, the naive fool, has learnt
through his passion to differentiate

608
02:20:20,814 --> 02:20:26,262
between truth and lies. Then in the face
of the needs of the children

609
02:20:26,315 --> 02:20:31,313
he has ripened to an active person,
now he is capable of dealing

610
02:20:31,372 --> 02:20:35,112
with his antagonist.

611
02:20:43,582 --> 02:20:49,077
Fredersen kneeling...
he too maturing through suffering.

612
02:20:50,836 --> 02:20:55,435
Slim and Josaphat
- another antagonistic pair -

613
02:20:55,843 --> 02:21:00,085
unite to offer him assistance.

614
02:21:19,913 --> 02:21:24,909
And finally Grot, the foreman,
less class-conscious

615
02:21:25,020 --> 02:21:28,761
than loyal to his rulers.

616
02:22:05,704 --> 02:22:11,501
In Pynchon's "Gravity's Rainbow",
Pökler remembers how Rotwang carried Mary

617
02:22:11,562 --> 02:22:16,554
onto the roof of the cathedral.
He was "taken by Klein-Rogge

618
02:22:16,613 --> 02:22:22,706
playing the mad inventor,
who he himself and his fellow students

619
02:22:22,772 --> 02:22:26,512
would have loved to be.

620
02:22:28,923 --> 02:22:33,920
Indispensable to those who ran
the Metropolis, yet at the end

621
02:22:33,979 --> 02:22:39,874
the untameable lion who could let it
all crash, girl, State,

622
02:22:39,936 --> 02:22:42,981
masses, himself,

623
02:22:43,038 --> 02:22:49,284
asserting his reality against them all
in one last roaring plunge

624
02:22:49,341 --> 02:22:53,739
from rooftop to street",
so remembers Pökler.

625
02:23:11,162 --> 02:23:17,114
In Harbou's novel the chastened
Fredersen finds comfort with his mother,

626
02:23:17,165 --> 02:23:22,960
who does not appear in the film,
she gives him a letter from his dead wife

627
02:23:23,023 --> 02:23:27,421
who pledges her love
throughout all eternity.

628
02:23:27,477 --> 02:23:30,978
A female trinity has the last word:

629
02:23:31,281 --> 02:23:35,180
Mary, Fredersen's mother, Hel.

630
02:23:36,084 --> 02:23:42,133
In Harbou's screenplay, Mary - acting
on an appeal from the Workers' wives -

631
02:23:42,188 --> 02:23:48,280
calls on Freder to be a mediator.
In the film as shot by Lang,

632
02:23:48,798 --> 02:23:55,554
the women retreat totally into
the underground and background.

633
02:24:11,214 --> 02:24:15,257
For the finale: The Mediator Theme.

634
02:24:26,131 --> 02:24:31,123
The Workers, as at the beginning
of the film, disciplined,

635
02:24:31,181 --> 02:24:38,232
darkly clothed and uniformed, marching
in unison in triangular formation,

636
02:24:38,292 --> 02:24:43,982
the loyal foreman at the vanguard,
ascend the steps at the cathedral

637
02:24:44,042 --> 02:24:49,141
to meet the triumvirate
awaiting them in the portal.

638
02:24:54,806 --> 02:24:59,299
The Mediator Theme culminates
in a combination

639
02:24:59,807 --> 02:25:03,605
of the Mary and the Metropolis Themes.

640
02:25:05,314 --> 02:25:11,602
The rest is dealt with by the chiefs,
the representatives of State and People,

641
02:25:11,666 --> 02:25:15,414
of Capital and Labour.

642
02:25:20,475 --> 02:25:25,074
The social partners still require
mutual trust.

643
02:25:34,439 --> 02:25:40,130
They need a mediator,
removed from the parties' interests.

644
02:25:51,505 --> 02:25:56,499
Mary, as a woman is permitted
to deliver the cue,

645
02:26:09,668 --> 02:26:13,412
thus completing her task.

646
02:26:14,225 --> 02:26:18,823
A male trinity analogous to the Father,
the Son

647
02:26:19,230 --> 02:26:23,130
and the Holy Spirit has been formed.

648
02:26:53,998 --> 02:26:59,950
Metropolis is a film of superlatives
also insofar as no other film

649
02:27:00,006 --> 02:27:04,959
provoked as much criticism,
analysis and interpretation,

650
02:27:05,012 --> 02:27:10,461
at least not since the nineteen-eighties,
simultaneously and in conjunction

651
02:27:10,514 --> 02:27:15,469
with new versions, new recordings,
reconstruction attempts,

652
02:27:15,521 --> 02:27:18,862
and allusions to this film in new ones.

653
02:27:18,921 --> 02:27:24,918
The film, its metaphors,
its allegory require interpretation.

654
02:27:26,032 --> 02:27:31,724
The interpretation is part of the
film's story, even if contradictory,

655
02:27:31,786 --> 02:27:38,291
bizarre and excessive. There is no need
to believe or accept any of them,

656
02:27:38,338 --> 02:27:44,131
but they should be acknowledged as this
is one of the pleasures the film offers,

657
02:27:44,195 --> 02:27:49,648
which are unthinkable without a certain
degree of light-hearted detachment.

658
02:27:49,702 --> 02:27:54,652
The commentary you have heard
was compiled by Enno Patalas,

659
02:27:54,703 --> 02:28:00,696
read by David Cooke, notes on the music
