RENTON: Choose life.
Choose a job.

3
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:36,043
Choose a career.
Choose a family.

4
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,634
Choose a fucking
big television.

5
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:40,107
Choose washing machines, cars,
compact-disc players,

6
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:41,927
and electrical tin openers.

7
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:54,081
Choose good health,
low cholesterol,

8
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:55,430
and dental insurance.

9
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:57,702
Choose fixed-interest
mortgage repayments.

10
00:00:57,803 --> 00:01:00,585
Choose a starter home.
Choose your friends.

11
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:04,069
Choose leisurewear
and matching luggage.

12
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,893
Choose a three-piece suite
on hire purchase

13
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:07,717
in a range of fucking fabrics.

14
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,818
Choose D.I.Y. and wondering who
you are on a Sunday morning.

15
00:01:10,922 --> 00:01:12,776
Choose sitting,
watching mind-numbing,

16
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,400
spirit-crushing game shows,

17
00:01:14,506 --> 00:01:17,189
stuffing fucking junk food
into your mouth.

18
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:25,569
Tommy, go!

19
00:01:25,674 --> 00:01:27,397
Choose rotting away
at the end of it,

20
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:29,090
pissing your last
in a miserable home.

21
00:01:29,193 --> 00:01:30,982
An embarrassment
to the selfish,

22
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:33,732
fucked-up brats that you've
spawned to replace yourself.

23
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,419
Choose your future.
Choose life.

24
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:40,611
# Here comes Johnny Yen again #

25
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:42,369
# With the liquor and drugs #

26
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:44,893
But why would I want to do
a thing like that?

27
00:01:45,543 --> 00:01:49,340
# He's gonna do
another striptease #

28
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:51,355
I chose not to choose life.

29
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:53,219
I chose something else.

30
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:54,780
And the reasons?

31
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,606
There are no reasons.

32
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,446
Who needs reasons
when you've got heroin?

33
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:03,331
# Yeah, something called love #

34
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:07,489
# Well, that's like
hypnotizing chickens #

35
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:10,720
[Baby cooing]

36
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:13,276
"Goldfinger's"
better than "Dr. No."

37
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,920
Both of them are a lot better
than "Diamonds Are Forever."

38
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:20,639
A judgment reflected
in its relatively poor showing

39
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,301
at the box office.

40
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:24,955
In which field, of course,

41
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:29,469
"Thunderball"
was a notable success.

42
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:31,994
People think it's all
about misery and desperation

43
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,818
and death and all that shite,
which is not to be ignored.

44
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:37,818
Fuck off!
Doss cunt!

45
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:42,402
But what they forget
is the pleasure of it.

46
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:44,986
Wild hands like me!

47
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,871
You prick!

48
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:51,771
Otherwise we wouldn't do it.

49
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,241
- Do you want me to do it?
- Yeah.

50
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:57,186
Beaut as the driven snow,
that shit, Danny.

51
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:03,362
After all,
we're not fucking stupid.

52
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,947
Well, at least, we're not
that fucking stupid.

53
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:19,928
Take the best orgasm
you ever had,

54
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:24,187
multiply it by 1, 000, and
you're still nowhere near it.

55
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,419
That beats any meat injection.

56
00:03:29,695 --> 00:03:33,623
That beats any fucking cock
in the world.

57
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:36,924
When you're on junk, you have
only one worry. Scoring.

58
00:03:37,024 --> 00:03:40,799
When you're off it, you worry
about all sorts of other shite.

59
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:42,304
Got no money.
Can't get drunk.

60
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:43,774
Got money.
Drinking too much.

61
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:45,465
Can't get a girl.
No chance of a ride.

62
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:47,640
Got a girl.
Too much hassle.

63
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:49,882
You have to worry about bills,
about food,

64
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:51,893
about some football team
that never wins,

65
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,492
about human relationships

66
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:55,485
and all of the things
that don't matter

67
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:59,259
when you've got a sincere
and truthful junk habit.

68
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:03,893
I'd say, in those days,
he was a muscular actor.

69
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:08,314
With all the presence of someone
like Cooper or Lancaster,

70
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:11,032
but combined with a sly wit...

71
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:15,123
...to make him a formidable
romantic lead.

72
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:18,837
Closer in that respect
to Cary Grant.

73
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:20,731
Aah.

74
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:26,458
# Hey, man,
where'd ya get that lotion? #

75
00:04:26,556 --> 00:04:30,931
# Your skin starts itching
once you buy the gimmick #

76
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:33,304
# About something called love #

77
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:34,832
# Love, love, love #

78
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,386
# Well, that's like
hypnotizing chickens #

79
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,872
The only drawback, or at least
the principal drawback,

80
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:44,467
is that you have to endure
cunts telling you...

81
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,865
"No way would I poison my body
with that shite."

82
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:51,156
All the fucking chemicals.

83
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,458
No fucking way.

84
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a waste of your life, Mark,

85
00:04:58,106 --> 00:05:00,407
poisoning your body
with that shite.

86
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:04,019
Every chance you've had, son,
you've blown it.

87
00:05:04,122 --> 00:05:06,542
Stuffing your veins
with that filth.

88
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:09,845
From time to time, even I
have uttered the magic words.

89
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:16,887
Never again, Swanney.
I'm off the scag.

90
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:17,847
Are you serious?

91
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:20,912
Yeah. No more.
I'm finished with that shite.

92
00:05:21,017 --> 00:05:21,877
It's up to you.

93
00:05:21,976 --> 00:05:24,463
I'm going to get it sorted out,
get off it for good.

94
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:26,510
I sure have heard
that one before.

95
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:28,274
The Sick Boy method.

96
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,284
Well, it really worked
for him, eh?

97
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:32,213
He's always been lacking
in moral fiber.

98
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:33,555
He knows a lot
about Sean Connery.

99
00:05:33,655 --> 00:05:35,760
That's hardly a substitute.

100
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:37,619
You need one more hit.

101
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:38,733
No, I don't think so.

102
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,977
For the long night
that lies ahead.

103
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,051
We called him Mother Superior

104
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:46,157
on account of the length
of his habit.

105
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:48,171
Of course
I'd have another shot.

106
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:49,738
After all, I had work to do.

107
00:06:05,685 --> 00:06:08,848
Relinquishing junk, stage one.
Preparation.

108
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:15,790
For this you will need one
room, which you will not leave.

109
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:19,634
Soothing music.
Tomato soup, 10 tins of.

110
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:24,331
Mushroom soup, 8 tins of
for consumption cold.

111
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:27,564
Ice cream, vanilla,
one large tub of.

112
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:29,610
Magnesia, milk of, one bottle.

113
00:06:29,715 --> 00:06:31,985
Paracetamol,
mouthwash, vitamins,

114
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:36,240
mineral water,
Lucozade, pornography.

115
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:38,513
One mattress.

116
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:42,407
One bucket for urine, one
for feces, and one for vomitus.

117
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:44,754
One television.

118
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:47,403
One bottle of Valium, which
I procured from my mother,

119
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:50,604
who is, in her own domestic
and socially acceptable way,

120
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:52,559
also a drug addict.

121
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,579
And now I'm ready.

122
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:59,143
All I need is one final hit

123
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:02,861
to soothe the pain while
the Valium takes effect.

124
00:07:04,945 --> 00:07:07,846
Mikey. Hi.
Yeah, it's Mark Renton.

125
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:10,373
Look, could you help me out?

126
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,163
This was typical
of Mikey Forrester.

127
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,915
What the fuck are these?

128
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:16,997
Under the normal run of things

129
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,215
I would have had nothing to do
with the cunt,

130
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,294
but this was not
the normal run of things.

131
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,854
Opium suppositories.

132
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,782
Ideal for your purposes.

133
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,556
Slow release.
Bring you down gradually.

134
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:31,526
Custom-fucking-designed
for your needs.

135
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:33,061
I want a fucking hit!

136
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:34,477
That's all I've got, man.

137
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:36,297
Take it or leave it.

138
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:48,684
Are you feeling better now?

139
00:07:48,781 --> 00:07:50,242
For all the good
they've done me,

140
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:52,934
I might as well have
stuck them up my arse.

141
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:56,964
Heroin makes you constipated.

142
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:59,076
The heroin from my last hit
is fading away.

143
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,384
The suppositories
have yet to melt.

144
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:03,077
Ohh!

145
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:05,893
I'm no longer constipated.

146
00:08:13,548 --> 00:08:16,843
I fantasize about massive
pristine convenience.

147
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,353
Brilliant gold taps,
virginal-white marble,

148
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,654
a seat carved from ebony,
a cistern full of Chanel No. 5,

149
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:27,780
and a flunky handing me
pieces of raw silk toilet roll.

150
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,110
But under the circumstances,
I'll settle for anywhere.

151
00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:44,031
Ohh.

152
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:45,250
[Gags]

153
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:52,319
Fuck.

154
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:54,312
Ohh! Oh!

155
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,019
[Defecating]

156
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,048
Ahh.

157
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:01,984
[Laughs]

158
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:06,213
[Breathing heavily]

159
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,929
[Defecating]

160
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:23,075
[Gags]

161
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,554
[Coughs, spits]

162
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:24,028
Yes, a fucking Godsend!

163
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:01,918
And now.

164
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,640
Now I'm ready.

165
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:06,299
The downside of coming off junk

166
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,286
was I knew I would mix
with my friends

167
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:10,238
in a state of full
consciousness.

168
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,612
It was awful.

169
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,053
They reminded me of myself.

170
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:14,842
I could hardly bear
to look at them.

171
00:11:14,943 --> 00:11:16,470
Take Sick Boy, for instance.

172
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,199
He came off junk
at the same time.

173
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,025
Not because he wanted to.

174
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:21,053
Just to annoy me.

175
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,124
Just to show me
how easily he could do it,

176
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:25,531
thereby downgrading
my own struggle.

177
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:27,571
Sneaky fucker, don't you think?

178
00:11:27,677 --> 00:11:30,645
When I wanted to lie there
and feel sorry for myself,

179
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,440
he insisted on telling me
once again

180
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,428
about his unifying theory
of life.

181
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:37,721
It's certainly a phenomenon
in all walks of life.

182
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:39,065
What do you mean?

183
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:42,195
Well, at one point,
you've got it.

184
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,755
Then you lose it,
and it's gone forever.

185
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,486
All walks of life.

186
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,292
Georgie Best, for example,
had it, lost it.

187
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:52,851
Or David Bowie, or Lou Reed.

188
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:54,865
Lou Reed? Some of his
solo stuff's not bad.

189
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:57,621
No, it's not bad, but it's not
great either, is it?

190
00:11:57,723 --> 00:11:59,130
In your heart, you kind of know

191
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:03,504
that although it sounds all
right, it's actually just shite.

192
00:12:05,178 --> 00:12:07,032
So who else?

193
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:11,473
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven,
Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley.

194
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:14,961
Okay, okay, so what is the point
you're trying to make?

195
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:19,473
All I am trying to do, Mark,
is to help you understand

196
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:22,326
that "The Name of the Rose"
is merely a blip

197
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:25,361
on an otherwise uninterrupted
downward trajectory.

198
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,637
And what about
"The Untouchables"?

199
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:30,256
I don't rate that at all.

200
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:32,401
Despite the Academy Award?

201
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:34,838
That means fuck all.

202
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:36,824
It's a sympathy vote.

203
00:12:38,361 --> 00:12:42,005
So we all get old, we can't hack
it anymore, and that's it?

204
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:43,958
Yeah.

205
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:45,911
That's your theory?

206
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,242
Yeah.

207
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:51,540
Beautifully fucking illustrated.

208
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:54,706
Give me the gun.

209
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:56,879
Give me the gun.

210
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,263
[Imitating Sean Connery]
Do you see the beast?

211
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:07,571
Have you got it in your sights?

212
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,037
Clear enough, Miss Moneypenny.

213
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:14,673
This should present
no significant problems.

214

[Gunshot, dog barking,
man screaming]

215
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:22,675
Aah! No!
Fuck! Aah!

216
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:27,344
For a vegetarian, Rents,
you're a fucking evil shot.

217
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:29,417
No! Get off!

218
00:13:29,844 --> 00:13:31,883
Without heroin,
I attempted to lead a useful

219
00:13:31,988 --> 00:13:33,961

as a good citizen.

[Burps]

221
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:41,323
- Good luck, Spud.
- Cheers, Cowboy.

222
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:44,395
Remember, if they think you're
not trying, you're in trouble.

223
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,288
First hint of that,
they'll be on to the DHSS.

224
00:13:46,388 --> 00:13:48,046
"This cunt is not trying."

225
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:50,187
And your giro is
fucking finished, right?

226
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:51,721
But then again, try too hard...

227
00:13:51,827 --> 00:13:53,550
You might get the fucking job.

228
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:54,414
Exactly.

229
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:55,278
Nightmare.

230
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:57,834
It's a tightrope, Spud.
It's a fucking tightrope.

231
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,459
See, I just get pure shy
with the interviewer cats.

232
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:02,733
I get all nervous.
I can't answer the questions.

233
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:06,129
I'm a footballer, and I get
nerves on the big occasion, man.

234
00:14:06,226 --> 00:14:07,370
Try some of this, Spud.

235
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:10,508
Yeah, a little dab of speed
is just the ticket, man.

236
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,965
No, I went to Craigy.
Craig Newton.

237
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:16,815
I just put down Royal Edinburgh
College to help get the job.

238
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:18,823
There's too much discrimination
in this town.

239
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:20,042
They're both schools.

240
00:14:20,145 --> 00:14:21,640
We're all in this together.

241
00:14:21,744 --> 00:14:24,363
I want to put across the general
idea rather than the details.

242
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,926
People get hung up on details.

243
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,268
Which school did I go to?
How many grades did I get?

244
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,026
It could be six.
Could be none.

245
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:31,306
It's not important.

246
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:34,375
What is important
is that I am, yes?

247
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,221
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you
lied on your application?

248
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:39,432
No!

249
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:42,469
Yes, only to get my foot
in the door.

250
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:43,819
Showing initiative and that.

251
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:45,925
You were referred by
the Department of Employment.

252
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,780
There was no need for you to get
your "foot in the door,"

253
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,341
as you put it.

254
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:53,032
Cool. Whatever you say, man.
Sorry.

255
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:54,925
You're the man,
the dude in the chair.

256
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:58,252
I am merely here.
But obviously I'm here.

257
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:00,490
Mr. Murphy,
what exactly attracts you

258
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,444
to the leisure industry?

259
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,961
In a word, pleasure.

260
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:08,265
Like, my pleasure
in other people's leisure.

261
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,626
Do you see yourself
as having any weaknesses?

262
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,426
Oh, yes, 'cause I'm a bit
of a perfectionist, actually.

263
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:17,386
Yes, I am.

264
00:15:17,485 --> 00:15:20,451
See, for me, it's got to be the
best, or it's nothing at all.

265
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:23,143
Like, if things get a bit dodgy,
I cannot be bothered.

266
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:26,474
But I've got good vibes about
this interview thing today.

267
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:29,191
Seems to me like
it's going pretty well.

268
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:32,328
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

269
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:35,115
We'll let you know.

270
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:36,226
The pleasure was mine.

271
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:38,787
Spud had done well.
I was proud of him.

272
00:15:38,892 --> 00:15:42,666
He fucked up good and proper.
You had to hand it to Spud.

273
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,119
BEGBIE:
Picture the scene.

274
00:15:46,218 --> 00:15:48,640
The other fucking week,
doing the fucking volley.

275
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:50,022
Me and Tommy playing pool.

276
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:52,293
I'm playing like
Paul fucking Newman by the way.

277
00:15:52,394 --> 00:15:55,176
Giving the boy here
the tanning of a lifetime.

278
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,377
So it comes to the last shot.

279
00:15:57,482 --> 00:15:59,521
The deciding ball
of the whole tournament.

280
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,120
I'm on the black,
and he's in the corner,

281
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:03,135
looking all fucking
biscuit-arsed,

282
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:05,281
when this hard cunt comes in.

283
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:08,004
Obviously fucking
fancied himself, like.

284
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:09,764
Starts staring at me.

285
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:11,392
Looking at me,
right fucking at me,

286
00:16:11,498 --> 00:16:14,050
as if to say,
"Come ahead, square, go."

287
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:15,101
You know me.

288
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,348
I'm not a type of cunt
that goes looking for bother.

289
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:19,936
At the end of the day,
I'm the cunt with the pool cue,

290
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,357
and he can get the fire end
in his puss anytime he wanted.

291
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:26,366
So I squares up, casual like.

292
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:30,246
What does the hard cunt do?
Or the so-called hard cunt?

293
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:31,522
Shites it.

294
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:35,333
Puts down his drink, turns,
and gets the fuck out of there.

295
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:39,457
And after that,
well, the game was mine.

296
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:44,803
And that was it.

297
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,626
That was Begbie's story.

298
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:48,995
At least that was Begbie's
version of the story.

299
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:51,941
But a couple of days later
I got the truth from Tommy.

300
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:53,760
You always got the truth
from Tommy.

301
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:55,552
It was one of
his major weaknesses.

302
00:16:55,654 --> 00:16:57,660
He never told lies,
he never took drugs,

303
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:59,620
and he never cheated
on anyone.

304
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:01,666
TOMMY:
It was Wednesday morning.

305
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:03,588
We were in the volley
playing pool.

306
00:17:03,686 --> 00:17:05,028
That much is true.

307
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:09,086
But Begbie is playing
absolutely fucking gash.

308
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:11,774
He's got a hangover so bad
he can hardly hold the cue,

309
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:13,284
never mind pot a ball.

310
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:15,289
I'm doing my best to lose,
you know.

311
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:18,046
Trying to humor him, like,
but it's not doing any good.

312
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:20,636
Every time I touch a ball,
I seem to pot something.

313
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,358
Every time Begbie goes near
the table, he fucks it up.

314
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,848
Oh, fuck's sake.

315
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:29,763
So he's got the hump, right?

316
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,088
But finally I manage to set it
up so all he has to do

317
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:35,129
is to pot the black
to win one game

318
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:36,828
to salvage a little bit of pride

319
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,420
and maybe not kick
my head in, right?

320
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:43,418
So he's on the black,
pressure shot.

321
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,219
And it all goes wrong, big-time.

322
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:50,946
Fuck!

323
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:52,698
Aah!

324
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,454
TOMMY: He picks on this specky
wee gadgee at the bar

325
00:17:55,553 --> 00:17:57,790
and accuses him of putting him
off by looking at him.

326
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:58,817
Can you believe it?

327
00:17:58,914 --> 00:18:00,701
The cunt hasn't glanced
in our direction.

328
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,847
Fuck off!

329
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:04,124
He was going to chib him,
I tell you.

330
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:06,526
Then I thought
he was going to do me.

331
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:11,835
The beggar's
fucking psycho, man.

332
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:16,346
But he's a mate, you know,
so what can you do?

333
00:18:16,448 --> 00:18:18,074
Can I borrow this?

334
00:18:18,176 --> 00:18:20,182
What indeed could one do?

335
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:22,874
Just stand back and watch
and try not to get involved.

[Glass shatters,
woman screams]

337
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,486
Begbie didn't do drugs, either.
He just did people.

338
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:31,259
That's what he got off on.
His own sensory addiction.

339
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,284

and no cunt leaves here till
we find out what cunt did it.

342

Who the fuck are you?

343

Yes!

Oh, Lizzy!

Oh, Lizzy!

350
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:13,495
Oh, Tom, come in me!

351
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:14,708
And as I sat watching

352
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:17,080
the intimate
and highly personal video,

353
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,247
stolen only hours earlier
from one of my best friends,

354
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:22,290
I realized
that something important

355
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:25,178
was missing from my life.

356
00:19:26,811 --> 00:19:29,494
# Leave no track #

357
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:31,855
# Don't look back #

358
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:34,166
# All I desire #

359
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:35,476
# Temptation #

360
00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:09,999
I read it in "Cosmopolitan."

361
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:11,598
It's an interesting theory.

362
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:13,197
Actually, it's a nightmare.

363
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:14,710
I've been desperate for a shag,

364
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:17,905
but watching him suffer
was just too much fun.

365
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:19,534
You should try it with Tommy.

366
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:22,867
What, and deny myself the only
pleasure I get from him?

367
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:24,429
Did I tell you about
my birthday?

368
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:25,232
What happened?

369
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:27,702
He forgot.
Useless motherfucker.

370
00:20:53,717 --> 00:20:56,105
BOTH:
What are you two talking about?

371
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:57,962
BOTH:
Football!

372
00:20:58,069 --> 00:20:59,377
What are you talking about?

373
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:00,817
BOTH:
Shopping.

374
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,242
The situation
was becoming serious.

375
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:07,406
Young Renton noticed the haste
with which the successful,

376
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:09,330
in the sexual sphere,
as in all others,

377
00:21:09,428 --> 00:21:12,275
segregated themselves
from the failures.

378
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,346
# I can't break away #

379
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:17,767
# Keep us from temptation #

380
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,258
# Keep us from temptation #

381
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,784
Heroin had robbed Renton
of his sex drive,

382
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:26,312
but now it returned
with a vengeance.

383
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,484
And as the impotence of
those days faded into memory,

384
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:33,099
grim desperation took a hold
in his sex-crazed mind.

385
00:21:33,202 --> 00:21:36,519
His post-junk libido, fueled
by alcohol and amphetamine,

386
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:40,401
taunted him remorselessly with
his own unsatisfied desire.

387
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:42,952
Dot, dot, dot.

388
00:21:43,056 --> 00:21:44,682
# You think
that you're right now #

389
00:21:44,785 --> 00:21:45,930
# Temptation #

390
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:48,072
# You're gonna face it
tonight now #

391
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:49,583
# Temptation #

392
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,819
# Oh, give me a breakdown #

393
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:53,130
# Temptation #

394
00:21:53,232 --> 00:21:55,566
# Because it's time
for a shakedown #

395
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:57,932
# Temptation #

396
00:21:58,031 --> 00:21:59,690
# Temptation #

397
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,286
# Temptation #

398
00:22:37,612 --> 00:22:41,955
And with that,
Mark Renton had fallen in love.

399
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,519
Excuse me,
I don't mean to harass you,

400
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,008
but I was very impressed
with the capable manner

401
00:22:55,116 --> 00:22:56,545
in which you dealt with that.

402
00:22:56,652 --> 00:22:58,987
I was thinking to myself,
"This girl's special."

403
00:22:59,084 --> 00:23:00,010
Thanks.

404
00:23:00,107 --> 00:23:01,929
- What's your name?
- Diane.

405
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:04,035
- Where are you going, Diane?
- I'm going home.

406
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:05,797
- Where's that?
- It's where you live.

407
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:06,793
Great.

408
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:07,938
What?

409
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:11,338
I'll come back with you,
but I'm not promising anything.

410
00:23:11,434 --> 00:23:13,736
Do you find that this approach
usually works?

411
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:16,200
Or, let me guess,
you've never tried it before.

412
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:19,232
In fact, you don't normally
approach girls, am I right?

413
00:23:19,338 --> 00:23:22,120
The truth is that you're
a quiet, sensitive type,

414
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:23,974
but if I'm prepared to
take a chance,

415
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:26,146
I might just get to know
the inner you.

416
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:30,471
Witty, adventurous, passionate,
loving, loyal.

417
00:23:30,568 --> 00:23:32,391
Taxi!

418
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:34,790
A little bit crazy,
a little bit bad.

419
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:38,686
But, hey, don't us girls
just love that?

420
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:42,791
Well, what's wrong, boy?

421
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:44,295
Cat got your tongue?

422
00:23:44,393 --> 00:23:46,368
I left something.

423
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:49,247
Are you getting in or not, pal?

424
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:11,484
Do you understand?

425
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,721
I expect you to be a considerate
and thoughtful lover.

426
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:16,764
Generous but firm.

427
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,567
What?

428
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:20,867
Failure on your part to live up
to these reasonable expectations

429
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:25,374
will result in swift resumption
of a non-sex situation.

430
00:24:25,477 --> 00:24:26,754
Right?

431
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,030
Diane.

432
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:41,146
Shh!

433
00:24:41,251 --> 00:24:41,850
What?

434
00:24:41,954 --> 00:24:43,995
Shut up!

435
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,478
Wake up, Spud.

436
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,519
Wake up.

437
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,348
Sex.

438
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:29,464
[Snoring]

439
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,357
Casual sex.

440
00:25:38,368 --> 00:25:40,953
Tommy, let's put the tape on.

441
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:41,982
Now?

442
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,632
I want to watch ourselves
while we're screwing.

443
00:25:44,735 --> 00:25:47,354
So let's see what I'm missing.

444
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,159
Not much.

445
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:06,362
MAN ON TV:
Pushed forward again.

446
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:08,319
And there's the captain,
Archie Gemmill,

447
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:10,269
picking it up from the outside.

448
00:26:10,365 --> 00:26:11,740
I think he wants to go himself.

449
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:13,942
He's gonna go.
He's going all the way.

450
00:26:14,046 --> 00:26:15,355
And he scores!

451
00:26:15,454 --> 00:26:18,040
Oh, what a magnificent goal!

452
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:20,148
Gemmill at his very best!

453
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:23,220
What a penetrating goal
that was!

454
00:26:23,324 --> 00:26:24,918
I haven't felt that good

455
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,281
since Archie Gemmill scored
against Holland in 1978.

456
00:26:31,932 --> 00:26:33,339
You can't sleep here.

457
00:26:33,437 --> 00:26:35,576
- What?
- Out.

458
00:26:35,676 --> 00:26:36,821
Come on!

459
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:39,510
No argument. You can sleep on
the sofa in the hall or go home.

460
00:26:39,612 --> 00:26:40,986
It's up to you.

461
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,602
And don't make any noise.

462
00:26:45,468 --> 00:26:47,094
Jesus!

463
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,158
What do you mean, "It's gone"?

464
00:26:55,258 --> 00:26:58,803
- Where has it gone, Tommy?
- It'll be here somewhere!

465
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:02,452
I might have returned it
by mistake.

466
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:03,534
Returned it?

467
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:07,318
Where?
The video shop, Tommy?

468
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,905
The fucking video shop?

469
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,199
So every punter in Edinburgh
is jerking off to our video?

470
00:27:14,777 --> 00:27:17,809
Oh, God, Tommy, I feel sick.

471
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:22,805
[Jet approaches]

472
00:27:26,904 --> 00:27:29,043
[Rattling]

473
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:37,202
[Fly buzzing]

474
00:27:40,631 --> 00:27:42,519
# Oh, you've got green eyes #

475
00:27:42,615 --> 00:27:44,077
# Oh, you've got blue eyes #

476
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:46,899
# Oh, you've got gray eyes #

477
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,347
# And I've never seen anyone #

478
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:51,152
Hi.

479
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:53,196
Hello.

480
00:27:53,303 --> 00:27:56,498
# No, I've never met anyone #

481
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:58,987
# Quite like you before #

482
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,204
Fuck.

483
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:19,565
[Screams]

484
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:24,172
Eh?

485
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:37,064
Come in and sit down.

486
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:38,829
Like some coffee?

487
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:39,694
Aye.

488
00:28:41,747 --> 00:28:42,892
You must be Mark.

489
00:28:42,995 --> 00:28:44,521
Aye, that's me.

490
00:28:49,843 --> 00:28:51,404
You're a friend of Diane's?

491
00:28:51,507 --> 00:28:53,100
More of a friend
of a friend, no?

492
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:54,282
Right.

493
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,664
Are you her flatmates, like?

494
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:02,096
Flatmates?

495
00:29:02,194 --> 00:29:03,949
I must remember that one.

496
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:06,793
DIANE:
Morning.

497
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:22,630
Good morning, Spud.

498
00:29:22,736 --> 00:29:25,736
Gail.
Mr. Houston, Mrs. Houston.

499
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,806
Good morning, Spud. Sit down
and have some breakfast.

500
00:29:31,407 --> 00:29:33,130
I'm sorry about last night,
by the way.

501
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:36,198
That's all right.
I slept fine on the sofa.

502
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,940
I had a bit much to drink.
I had a bit of an accident.

503
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:42,980
Don't worry, son.
These things happen.

504
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:46,218
It does a man good to cut loose
once in a while.

505
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:49,100
This one could do with being
tied up once in a while.

506
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:50,856
I'll put the sheets
in the machine.

507
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,932
No, no, no, I'll wash them.

508
00:29:53,037 --> 00:29:54,729
- There's no need.
- It's no problem.

509
00:29:54,831 --> 00:29:55,779
It's no problem for me.

510
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:57,446
I'd rather take care
of it myself.

511
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,695
Honestly, it's no problem.

512
00:29:58,798 --> 00:29:59,692
Really, no!

513
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:01,894
Spud, they're my sheets!

514
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:15,011
I don't see why not.

515
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:16,741
Because it's illegal.
That's why not.

516
00:30:16,844 --> 00:30:17,859
What? Holding hands?

517
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:19,044
Not holding hands.

518
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:20,641
In that case, you can do it.

519
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:21,851
You were quite happy to do
a lot more last night.

520
00:30:21,884 --> 00:30:22,954
You were quite happy to do
a lot more last night.

521
00:30:23,052 --> 00:30:24,513
Yeah, and that's what's illegal.

522
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,113
Do you know what they'd do
to me inside?

523
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:28,522
They cut your balls off and
flush them down the toilet.

524
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,529
Calm down.
You're not going to jail.

525
00:30:30,636 --> 00:30:32,774
Well, that's very easy
for you to say, Diane.

526
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,657
- Can I see you again?
- Certainly not!

527
00:30:35,754 --> 00:30:38,983
If you don't see me again,
I'll tell the police.

Doesn't it make you proud
to be Scottish?

It's shite being Scottish!

sold them, swapped them,
forged them, photocopied them,

towards the day
that it would all go wrong.

686
00:40:09,922 --> 00:40:12,988
Because no matter how much you
stash or how much you steal,

be long before we meet again.

Since I last saw him,

as a pimp and a pusher

to mix business and pleasure,

01:12:53,966 --> 01:12:55,625
and I did what had to be done.

1225
01:12:55,726 --> 01:12:59,140
[Breathing heavily]

1226
01:12:59,244 --> 01:13:01,068
It's good.

1227
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:04,132
Oh, it's really fucking good.

1228
01:13:04,845 --> 01:13:08,008
Mmm. Ohh.
[Exhales deeply]

1229
01:13:08,109 --> 01:13:10,498
Yeah, that hit was good.

1230
01:13:10,605 --> 01:13:13,386
I promised myself another one
before I got to London.

1231
01:13:13,484 --> 01:13:16,745
Just the one like.
For old time's sake.

1232
01:13:16,844 --> 01:13:19,462
Just to piss Begbie off.

1233
01:13:19,564 --> 01:13:21,221
This was his nightmare.

1234
01:13:21,323 --> 01:13:23,941
The dodgiest scam
in a lifetime of dodgy scams

1235
01:13:24,043 --> 01:13:25,865
being perpetrated with three
of the most useless

1236
01:13:25,962 --> 01:13:29,378
and unreliable fuck-ups
in town.

1237
01:13:29,483 --> 01:13:30,977
I knew what was going on
in his mind.

1238
01:13:31,082 --> 01:13:33,472
Any trouble in London, and
he would dump us immediately.

1239
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:34,507
One way or another.

1240
01:13:34,603 --> 01:13:35,945
He had to.

1241
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:38,183
If he got caught
with a bagful of scag,

1242
01:13:38,285 --> 01:13:39,714
on top of
that armed-robbery shit,

1243
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:42,306
he was going down for 15 to 20.

1244
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:44,487
Begbie was hard,
but not so hard

1245
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:47,434
that he didn't shite it
off 20 years in Sultan.

1246
01:13:54,442 --> 01:13:56,897
This was to be my final hit.

1247
01:13:57,001 --> 01:13:58,757
But let's be clear about this.

1248
01:13:58,857 --> 01:14:01,791
There's final hits
and final hits.

1249
01:14:01,897 --> 01:14:03,784
What kind was this to be?

1250
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:10,373
Did you bring the cards?

1251
01:14:10,633 --> 01:14:11,909
- What?
- The cards.

1252
01:14:12,009 --> 01:14:14,463
The last thing I told you
was to mind the cards.

1253
01:14:14,568 --> 01:14:16,608
Well, I've not brought them.

1254
01:14:18,505 --> 01:14:20,774
Fucking boring after a while
without the cards.

1255
01:14:20,872 --> 01:14:22,912
I'm sorry.

1256
01:14:23,016 --> 01:14:25,120
- Bit fucking late.
- Why didn't you bring them?

1257
01:14:25,224 --> 01:14:28,801
'Cause I fucking told you
to bring them, you doss cunt!

1258
01:14:29,574 --> 01:14:30,719
Christ.

1259
01:15:16,197 --> 01:15:17,723
These are your friends, right?

1260
01:15:17,827 --> 01:15:20,762
These are the guys
I told you about.

1261
01:15:20,868 --> 01:15:23,169
- Well, is he here?
- Yeah, he's here.

1262
01:15:23,267 --> 01:15:25,090
You didn't get followed,
did you?

1263
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:27,162
[Scoffs]
We didn't get followed.

1264
01:15:27,266 --> 01:15:28,575
Okay.

1265
01:15:44,898 --> 01:15:46,043
All right.

1266
01:15:46,146 --> 01:15:47,258
Aye.

1267
01:15:49,826 --> 01:15:52,281
Straightaway he clocked us
for what we were.

1268
01:15:52,385 --> 01:15:55,255
Small-time wasters
with an accidental big deal.

1269
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,386
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1270
01:16:48,541 --> 01:16:50,034
[Door opens]

1271
01:16:58,557 --> 01:17:02,997
So how much would you like
for this?

1272
01:17:05,372 --> 01:17:06,899
20,000.

1273
01:17:08,508 --> 01:17:11,508
Well, I don't think it's worth
much more than  15,000.

1274
01:17:11,611 --> 01:17:13,335
This was a real drag to him.

1275
01:17:13,435 --> 01:17:15,257
He didn't need to negotiate.

1276
01:17:15,355 --> 01:17:17,494
What the fuck were we going
to do if he didn't buy it?

1277
01:17:17,595 --> 01:17:20,148
Sell it on the streets?
Fuck that!

1278
01:17:20,251 --> 01:17:21,975
Well,  19,000.

1279
01:17:22,076 --> 01:17:24,758
I'm terribly sorry.
I can't go to  19,000.

1280
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:29,560
Well, fucking  16,000, then.

1281
01:17:31,514 --> 01:17:32,408
Okay.

1282
01:17:32,507 --> 01:17:34,994
Well, fucking  16,000
it is, then.

1283
01:17:39,193 --> 01:17:42,358
These, gentlemen,
are 2,000 bundles.

1284
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:45,108
Here's two.

1285
01:17:45,209 --> 01:17:46,867
That's four.

1286
01:17:46,969 --> 01:17:49,270
We settled on 16, 000.

1287
01:17:49,369 --> 01:17:52,980
He had more in the suitcase,
but it was better than nothing.

1288
01:17:59,768 --> 01:18:02,223
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

1289
01:18:02,328 --> 01:18:04,816
I'd like to say it's been
a pleasure haggling with you.

1290
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,058
Fucking brand-new,
by the way.

1291
01:18:09,432 --> 01:18:10,359
Okay.

1292
01:18:12,727 --> 01:18:14,702
- Yes!
- Yes!

1293
01:18:14,806 --> 01:18:16,148
Fucking...

1294
01:18:17,014 --> 01:18:19,665
And just for a moment,
it felt really great.

1295
01:18:19,766 --> 01:18:21,587
Like we were in it together,
like friends.

1296
01:18:21,685 --> 01:18:23,114
Like it meant something.

1297
01:18:23,222 --> 01:18:25,589
A moment like that
can touch you deep inside.

1298
01:18:25,686 --> 01:18:27,124
But it doesn't last long,
not like 16, 000.

1299
01:18:27,157 --> 01:18:28,562
But it doesn't last long,
not like 16, 000.

1300
01:18:28,661 --> 01:18:31,660
So what about you, Spud, any
investments on the horizon?

1301
01:18:31,765 --> 01:18:33,904
Gonna buy yourself
a wee island in the sun?

1302
01:18:34,004 --> 01:18:34,987
For four fucking grand?

1303
01:18:35,093 --> 01:18:38,989
One palm tree, a couple
of rocks, and a sewage outflow.

1304
01:18:39,862 --> 01:18:42,065
[Snorts]
I don't know, man.

1305
01:18:42,166 --> 01:18:44,533
I'm gonna get something
for my ma.

1306
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:48,655
Get some good speed, no bicarb.

1307
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:50,698
And get a girl, take her out,
treat her right.

1308
01:18:50,805 --> 01:18:51,753
Shag her senseless.

1309
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:53,836
No, man!
True love.

1310
01:18:53,941 --> 01:18:55,281
True love.

1311
01:18:55,379 --> 01:18:56,721
Hey, but I could handle

1312
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:59,602
some hot sex
with a Jewish Princess.

1313
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:01,674
- You daft cunt!
- Or a Catholic!

1314
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:02,707
If you're gonna waste it
on a bird,

1315
01:19:02,803 --> 01:19:05,191
you may as well fucking
leave all of it to me.

1316
01:19:05,298 --> 01:19:06,640
Now get the drinks.

1317
01:19:06,738 --> 01:19:09,738
- I got the last one.
- It's your round, Franco.

1318
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:13,107
Okay.
Same again?

1319
01:19:13,204 --> 01:19:15,537
Right.
I'm off for a pish.

1320
01:19:15,634 --> 01:19:18,090
See when I get back
the money's still here, okay?

1321
01:19:18,195 --> 01:19:19,950
The moment your back's turned,
we're out the door.

1322
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:21,577
I'll be right fucking after you.

1323
01:19:21,683 --> 01:19:24,235
You'll never catch us,
you flabby bastard.

1324
01:19:24,337 --> 01:19:26,509
By the way,
see when I get back.

1325
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:29,030
Be halfway down the street
with the money.

1326
01:19:29,137 --> 01:19:30,479
Fucking kill you.

1327
01:19:30,578 --> 01:19:32,717
I thought you might, Franco.

1328
01:19:32,817 --> 01:19:34,278
I thought you might.

1329
01:19:38,577 --> 01:19:40,714
Are you game for it?

1330
01:19:40,815 --> 01:19:42,277
What?

1331
01:19:43,888 --> 01:19:45,295
Well?

1332
01:19:46,352 --> 01:19:47,879
Are you serious?

1333
01:19:55,568 --> 01:19:56,496
Don't know.

1334
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:58,021
What do you think?

1335
01:19:59,312 --> 01:20:00,424
Still here, I see.

1336
01:20:00,528 --> 01:20:02,829
Oh, well, we wouldn't
run out on a mate, eh?

1337
01:20:02,927 --> 01:20:05,163
Why not?
I know I would.

1338
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,625
Where's Franco?

1339
01:20:10,094 --> 01:20:12,484
For fuck's sake!

1340
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:13,735
Sorry, mate.

1341
01:20:13,838 --> 01:20:17,003
You ruined my fucking suit,
you fucking idiot.

1342
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:18,510
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1343
01:20:18,607 --> 01:20:20,582
Sorry's not gonna
dry me off, you cunt.

1344
01:20:20,687 --> 01:20:23,533
Cool down, Franco.
The man says he's sorry.

1345
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:26,729
Not sorry enough
for being a fat cunt.

1346
01:20:26,829 --> 01:20:28,869
If you can't hold a pint,
you shouldn't be in the pub.

1347
01:20:28,973 --> 01:20:29,955
Fuck off.

1348
01:20:34,156 --> 01:20:35,815
[Garbled]
Aah.

1349
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:38,217
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, no!

1350
01:20:45,259 --> 01:20:47,233
Come on, Franco, move away.
Aah!

1351
01:20:47,339 --> 01:20:49,608
Aah!
Fuck's sake!

1352
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:52,096
Oh, fucking nice one, Franco!

1353
01:20:52,204 --> 01:20:53,797
- Shut it!
- You cut me, man!

1354
01:20:53,899 --> 01:20:55,907
You were in my fucking way.

1355
01:20:56,012 --> 01:20:57,255
Help!

1356
01:20:58,379 --> 01:20:59,656
[Weakly] Oh, no.

1357
01:20:59,756 --> 01:21:02,854
Anybody else want to get
in my fucking way?

1358
01:21:02,955 --> 01:21:04,132
You?

1359
01:21:06,443 --> 01:21:07,523
You?

1360
01:21:12,298 --> 01:21:17,480
Hey, Rent Boy, you bring me down
a fucking smoke.

1361
01:21:17,578 --> 01:21:20,424
- I think we'd better go, Franco!
- Go to the hospital!

1362
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:24,133
You're not going to any fucking
hospital, and you're staying.

1363
01:21:27,018 --> 01:21:30,017
You bring me down
a fucking cigarette.

1364
01:21:35,561 --> 01:21:37,088
And the bag.

1365
01:22:46,723 --> 01:22:50,170
# Drive boy, dog boy,
dirty, numb, angel boy #

1366
01:22:50,275 --> 01:22:53,503
# In-the-doorway boy,
she was a lipstick boy #

1367
01:22:53,602 --> 01:22:56,766
# She was a beautiful boy,

1368

# And you just groan, boy #

01:23:08,802 --> 01:23:10,941
# She said,
"Come over, come over" #

1374
01:23:11,042 --> 01:23:13,529
# She smiled at you #

01:23:13,634 --> 01:23:17,430

01:24:24,539 --> 01:24:26,612
# You're real, boy,
speak to me, boy #

1394
01:24:26,716 --> 01:24:28,985
# Dog-dirty,
numb-cracking boy #

1395
01:24:29,084 --> 01:24:30,293
# You get wet, boy #

1396
01:24:30,395 --> 01:24:31,889
# Big, big-time boy #

1397
01:24:31,996 --> 01:24:33,403
# Acid-bear boy #

1398
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:36,499
# Babes and babes and babes
and babes and babes #

1399
01:24:36,603 --> 01:24:38,838
# And remembering nothing,
boy #

1400
01:24:38,938 --> 01:24:41,240
# Will you like
my tin horn, boy? #

1401
01:24:41,339 --> 01:24:47,003
# And get wet like an angel,
derail #

1402
01:24:58,745 --> 01:25:02,007
Now, I've justified this
to myself in all sorts of ways.

1403
01:25:02,106 --> 01:25:04,626
It wasn't a big deal,
just a minor betrayal.

1404
01:25:04,729 --> 01:25:08,471
Or we'd outgrown each other.
You know, that sort of thing.

1405
01:25:08,569 --> 01:25:10,479
But let's face it.
I ripped them off.

1406
01:25:10,585 --> 01:25:12,788
My so-called mates.

1407
01:25:12,888 --> 01:25:15,027
But Begbie. I couldn't give
a shit about him.

1408
01:25:15,129 --> 01:25:16,623
And Sick Boy.
He'd have done the same to me

1409
01:25:16,728 --> 01:25:18,485
if he'd only thought
of it first.

1410
01:25:20,025 --> 01:25:22,708
And Spud. Well, okay,
I felt sorry for Spud.

1411
01:25:22,808 --> 01:25:24,565
He never hurt anybody.

1412
01:25:30,712 --> 01:25:33,493
- BEGBIE: Bastard!
- [Glass shattering]

1413
01:25:38,774 --> 01:25:40,814
Bastard!

1414
01:25:43,862 --> 01:25:45,836
Fuck! Fuck!

1415
01:25:45,942 --> 01:25:47,599
All right, move away, people.

1416
01:25:47,701 --> 01:25:49,457
What's going on in there?

1417
01:25:50,581 --> 01:25:53,069
Open up.
Open up now!

1418
01:25:53,174 --> 01:25:54,865
Bastard!

1419
01:25:55,542 --> 01:25:56,970
Bastard!

1420
01:25:57,078 --> 01:25:59,314
So why did I do it?

1421
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:02,892
I could offer
a million answers, all false.

1422
01:26:02,996 --> 01:26:04,972
The truth is
that I'm a bad person,

1423
01:26:05,078 --> 01:26:06,451
but that's gonna change.

1424
01:26:06,549 --> 01:26:08,305
I'm going to change.

1425
01:26:08,405 --> 01:26:10,315
This is the last
of that sort of thing.

1426
01:26:10,421 --> 01:26:12,013
I'm cleaning up
and I'm moving on.

1427
01:26:12,117 --> 01:26:14,321
Going straight
and choosing life.

1428
01:26:14,421 --> 01:26:16,559
I'm looking forward to it
already.

1429
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:18,668
I'm going to be just like you.

1430
01:26:18,772 --> 01:26:21,291
The job, the family,
the fucking big television,

1431
01:26:21,395 --> 01:26:22,889
the washing machine, the car,

1432
01:26:22,996 --> 01:26:24,883
the compact disc,
and electrical tin opener,

1433
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:27,118
good health, low cholesterol,
dental insurance,

1434
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:29,838
mortgage, starter home,
leisurewear, luggage,

1435
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:32,175
three-piece suite,
D.I.Y., game shows,

1436
01:26:32,275 --> 01:26:34,185
junk food, children,
walks in the park,

1437
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:36,712
9:00 to 5:00, good at golf,
washing the car,

1438
01:26:36,819 --> 01:26:38,641
choice of sweaters,
family Christmas,

1439
01:26:38,739 --> 01:26:42,153
indexed pension, tax exemption,
clearing gutters, getting by,

1440
01:26:42,258 --> 01:26:44,810
looking ahead
to the day you die.
