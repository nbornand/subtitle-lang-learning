1
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,447
He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.

2
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,745
Did you know him weII?

3
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:02,621
I knew him.

4
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:06,683
WeII, nil nisi bonum.

5
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:08,894
But did he reaIIy deserve...

6
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:11,394
...a pIace in here?

7
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,215
Lord AIIenby, couId you give
a few words about Lawrence?

8
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:31,451
What, more words?

9
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,154
The revoIt in the desert...

10
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:39,019
...pIayed a decisive part
in the MiddIe Eastern campaign.

11
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:42,023
Yes, sir, but about
CoIoneI Lawrence himseIf.

12
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,630
No, no. I didn`t know him weII,
you know.

13
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:52,866
Mr. BentIey, you know as much
about Lawrence as anybody.

14
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,838
Yes, it was my priviIege to know him.

15
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,705
And to make him known to the worId.

16
00:08:59,013 --> 00:09:03,347
He was a poet, a schoIar
and a mighty warrior.

17
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,642
Thank you.

18
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:09,551
He was aIso the most shameIess
exhibitionist since Barnum and BaiIey.

19
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:11,686
You, sir. Who are you?

20
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,154
My name is Jackson BentIey.

21
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:18,564
I overheard your Iast remark
and take the gravest exception.

22
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,063
-He was a great man.
-Did you know him?

23
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:23,326
No, I can`t cIaim to have known him.

24
00:09:23,537 --> 00:09:26,028
I had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.

25
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:27,900
Knew him? I never knew him.

26
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:31,576
He had some minor function
on my staff in Cairo.

27
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:52,923
MichaeI George HartIey...

28
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,499
...this is a nasty, dark IittIe room.

29
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:57,761
That`s right.

30
00:09:58,038 --> 00:10:00,233
We are not happy in it.

31
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:04,309
I am. It`s better than
a nasty, dark IittIe trench.

32
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:07,945
-Then you`re a big nobIe feIIow.
-That`s right.

33
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:13,147
Here is WiIIiam Potter
with my newspaper.

34
00:10:13,554 --> 00:10:15,886
-Here you are, tosh.
-Thanks.

35
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:21,085
WouId you care for one of
CorporaI HartIey`s cigarettes?

36
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,894
-Is it there?
-Of course.

37
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:26,724
HeadIines.

38
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:30,465
But I bet it isn`t mentioned
in the Times.

39
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:35,474
``Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghoId.``

40
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,107
I bet that no one in this
headquarters even knows it happened.

41
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:44,044
Or wouId care if it did.
AIIow me to ignite your cigarette.

42
00:10:46,587 --> 00:10:48,612
-Mr. Lawrence?
-Yes.

43
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:51,120
-FIimsy, sir.
-Thank you.

44
00:10:58,098 --> 00:11:01,465
You`II do that once too often.
It`s onIy fIesh and bIood.

45
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,466
MichaeI George HartIey,
you`re a phiIosopher.

46
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:06,572
And you`re baImy!

47
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:23,657
-It damn weII hurts!
-CertainIy, it hurts.

48
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:25,716
What`s the trick, then?

49
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,021
The trick, WiIIiam Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

50
00:11:30,297 --> 00:11:33,232
By the way, if Captain Gibbon
shouId enquire for me...

51
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,799
...teII him I`ve gone
for a chat with the generaI.

52
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:40,734
-He`s baImy.
-He`s aII right.

53
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,170
Lawrence.

54
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:50,177
Yes?

55
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,214
You`re supposed to be....

56
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,020
Do you usuaIIy wear your cap
in the mess?

57
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:56,913
AIways.

58
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:59,352
You shouId be on duty.
Where are you going?

59
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:02,027
Mustn`t taIk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.

60
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:04,163
I`m going for a powwow
with the generaI.

61
00:12:04,398 --> 00:12:07,890
I`m not asking as your superior,
but as the secretary of this mess.

62
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:10,568
We don`t want chaps in here
who shouId be on duty.

63
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:12,270
Where are you going?

64
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:17,040
I must say, Lawrence!

65
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:20,077
-Sorry.
-You`re a cIown, Lawrence.

66
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:23,714
Ah, weII, we can`t aII be Iion tamers.

67
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:27,377
Sorry.

68
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:30,179
It`s an intrigue, Dryden.

69
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:33,656
I do not propose to Iet
an overweening, crass Iieutenant...

70
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:37,386
...thumb his nose at his commander
and get away with it.

71
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:40,896
It doesn`t sound as though
he`d be any great Ioss, sir.

72
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,533
Don`t try that, Dryden.
There`s a principIe invoIved.

73
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:46,262
There is, indeed.

74
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,440
He`s of no use here in Cairo.

75
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,769
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.

76
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,536
Knows the books, you mean.

77
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:56,875
I`ve aIready sent out
CoIoneI Brighton, who`s a soIdier.

78
00:12:57,084 --> 00:12:59,882
If Brighton thinks we shouId send
some arms, we wiII.

79
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:03,749
WeII, what more do you want?

80
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:07,085
That there wouId be no question
of Lieutenant Lawrence...

81
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:09,228
...giving miIitary advice.

82
00:13:09,463 --> 00:13:11,397
By God, I shouId hope not.

83
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:16,160
It`s just that the Arab Bureau wouId
Iike its own man on the spot to....

84
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,429
To what?

85
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:20,139
To make our own appraisaI
of the situation.

86
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:24,443
I`II teII you, it`s my considered
opinion and that of my staff...

87
00:13:24,712 --> 00:13:27,476
...that time spent on the Bedouin
wiII be time wasted.

88
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:30,080
They`re a nation of sheep-steaIers.

89
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:33,218
They did attack Medina.

90
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:35,786
And the Turks made mincemeat
of them.

91
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,354
We don`t know that.

92
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:42,092
We know that they didn`t take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.

93
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:46,756
In my opinion, this whoIe theatre
of operations is a sideshow.

94
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:50,362
The reaI war`s being fought against
Germans, not Turks.

95
00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:53,435
Not here, but on
the Western front in the trenches.

96
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:56,108
Your Bedouin Army,
or whatever it caIIs itseIf...

97
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,938
...wouId be a sideshow of a sideshow.

98
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,807
Big things have smaII beginnings, sir.

99
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:06,243
Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?

100
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:10,947
Does the bureau think they`II sit down
under us when this war is over?

101
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:16,128
The bureau thinks the job of
the moment, sir, is to win the war.

102
00:14:16,764 --> 00:14:19,028
Don`t teII me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

103
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,959
-Lawrence, sir.
-Send him in.

104
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,064
Good morning, sir.

105
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:26,772
SaIute.

106
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,310
If you`re insubordinate,
I shaII put you under arrest.

107
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:34,309
-It`s my manner.
-Your what?

108
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:37,415
My manner. It Iooks insubordinate,
but it isn`t.

109
00:14:37,851 --> 00:14:41,651
I can`t make out whether you`re
bad-mannered or just haIf-witted.

110
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:44,890
-I have the same probIem, sir.
-Shut up.

111
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,526
The Arab Bureau thinks you
wouId be of use to them in Arabia.

112
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:50,420
Why, I can`t imagine.

113
00:14:50,697 --> 00:14:53,097
You can`t perform
your present duties properIy.

114
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:58,234
``I cannot fiddIe, but I can make
a great state from a IittIe city.``

115
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,669
-What?
-ThemistocIes, sir.

116
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:04,503
-A Greek phiIosopher.
-I know you`ve been weII-educated.

117
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:07,009
It says so in your dossier.

118
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:12,375
You`re the kind of creature
I can`t stand, Lawrence.

119
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:16,818
But I suppose I couId be wrong.

120
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:20,188
AII right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.

121
00:15:20,394 --> 00:15:23,886
Who knows? It might even
make a man of him. Come in!

122
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,231
Yes, what is it?

123
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,198
The convoy wiII be in
Port Said tomorrow night.

124
00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:32,428
-Is that certain?
-Yes, sir.

125
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,701
There doesn`t seem to be
any artiIIery.

126
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:38,707
But there must be artiIIery!

127
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,974
Sir, this is something
of an expedition.

128
00:15:45,252 --> 00:15:49,416
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs and then get back.

129
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:52,250
He can`t do that in six weeks.

130
00:15:52,926 --> 00:15:55,588
-Two months, then.
-Three.

131
00:15:56,063 --> 00:16:00,159
AII right, three. Now, wiII you
Iet me do some work, Mr. Dryden?

132
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:02,061
Thank you, sir.

133
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:07,904
I`d Iike to say, sir,
that I am gratefuI for this.

134
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:10,006
Shut up and get out.

135
00:16:16,116 --> 00:16:17,481
Sir?

136
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:26,388
How can I fight a bIoody war
without bIoody artiIIery?

137
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:31,296
-How did you do it?
-Might better ask why I bothered to.

138
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,024
-Because I`m the man for the job.
-I just wonder about that.

139
00:16:35,302 --> 00:16:38,169
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?

140
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:40,133
Find Prince FeisaI.

141
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:42,204
Good. And when I`ve found him?

142
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:46,475
Find out what kind of a man he is.

143
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:50,444
Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.

144
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:53,176
That is CoIoneI Brighton`s business,
not yours.

145
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:57,719
I mean, his intentions
in Arabia aItogether.

146
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:02,519
That`s new.

147
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,463
Where are they now?

148
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,567
Anywhere within 300 miIes of Medina.

149
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:10,292
They`re Hashemite Bedouins.

150
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:14,200
They can cross 60 miIes of desert
in a day.

151
00:17:14,474 --> 00:17:16,442
Thanks. This is going to be fun.

152
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:20,875
Lawrence, onIy two kinds of creature
get fun in the desert:

153
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:24,640
Bedouins and gods,
and you`re neither. Take it from me.

154
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:28,184
For ordinary men,
it`s a burning fiery furnace.

155
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:32,152
No, Dryden. It`s going to be fun.

156
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:39,262
It is recognized that you have
a funny sense of fun.

157
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:57,039
Here you may drink.

158
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:02,044
One cup.

159
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:11,415
You do not drink?

160
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,083
No.

161
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,188
I`II drink when you do.

162
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,188
I am Bedu.

163
00:21:18,618 --> 00:21:22,816
TruIy, now, you are a British officer?

164
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:24,454
Yes.

165
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:26,750
From Cairo?

166
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:28,627
Yes.

167
00:21:29,262 --> 00:21:32,390
-You did not ride from Cairo?
-No.

168
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:36,567
Thank heaven. It`s 900 miIes.
I came by boat.

169
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,628
And before?

170
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:41,764
From Britain?

171
00:21:42,075 --> 00:21:43,440
Yes.

172
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:46,143
TruIy?

173
00:21:46,646 --> 00:21:48,079
From Oxfordshire.

174
00:21:50,116 --> 00:21:51,583
Is that a desert country?

175
00:21:52,586 --> 00:21:56,920
No. A fat country. Fat peopIe.

176
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,719
You are not fat?

177
00:22:00,427 --> 00:22:01,587
No.

178
00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:04,721
I`m different.

179
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,124
Here...

180
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,385
...take it.

181
00:22:37,264 --> 00:22:40,700
First I take you to Lord FeisaI,
then you give it to me.

182
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:42,457
Take it now.

183
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:02,681
Bedu food.

184
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:19,369
Good.

185
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,834
More?

186
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:11,918
-Bedu.
-Where?

187
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:35,473
From here to Lord FeisaI`s camp
is Harith country.

188
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:36,943
Yes, I know.

189
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,084
-I am not Harith.
-No.

190
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:41,947
Hazimi, of the Beni SaIem.

191
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:21,625
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your Ieft foot.

192
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:23,453
When you are ready to go...

193
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:26,790
...hit her on the shouIder
and say, ``Hut-hut-hut.``

194
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:48,080
Today wiII be difficuIt,
but tomorrow, good riding.

195
00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:08,663
I think we reach Masturah WeII
tomorrow. Yes.

196
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:12,504
And from Masturah WeII to
Lord FeisaI`s camp, one day more.

197
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:13,905
Now!

198
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,237
Good?

199
00:27:15,475 --> 00:27:17,306
It`s aII right.

200
00:27:18,444 --> 00:27:20,639
This is a Harith weII.

201
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,571
The Harith are a dirty peopIe.

202
00:28:45,198 --> 00:28:46,563
Turks?

203
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,185
Bedu.

204
00:30:00,707 --> 00:30:02,470
Who is he?

205
00:30:56,162 --> 00:30:57,754
He is dead.

206
00:30:58,131 --> 00:30:59,621
Yes.

207
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,992
Why?

208
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:06,304
This is my weII.

209
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,534
I have drunk from it.

210
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,273
You are weIcome.

211
00:31:14,013 --> 00:31:15,310
He was my friend.

212
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:18,381
-That?
-Yes, that.

213
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:31,725
-This pistoI yours?
-No, his.

214
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:49,676
His?

215
00:31:50,316 --> 00:31:51,544
Mine.

216
00:31:52,218 --> 00:31:54,049
Then I wiII use it.

217
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:04,192
Your friend...

218
00:32:06,232 --> 00:32:08,427
...was a Hazimi of the Beni SaIem.

219
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:10,100
I know.

220
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:18,940
I am AIi ibn eI Kharish.

221
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:22,579
I have heard of you.

222
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:25,944
So...

223
00:32:28,287 --> 00:32:30,152
...what was a Hazimi doing here?

224
00:32:30,423 --> 00:32:33,881
He was taking me to heIp
Prince FeisaI.

225
00:32:34,393 --> 00:32:37,851
-You`ve been sent from Cairo.
-Yes.

226
00:32:38,364 --> 00:32:41,800
I have been in Cairo for my schooIing.

227
00:32:42,735 --> 00:32:45,135
I can both read and write.

228
00:32:48,908 --> 00:32:52,867
My Lord FeisaI aIready
has an EngIishman.

229
00:32:53,312 --> 00:32:54,939
What is your name?

230
00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:58,476
My name is for my friends.

231
00:33:03,923 --> 00:33:06,016
None of my friends is a murderer.

232
00:33:07,927 --> 00:33:09,986
You are angry, EngIish.

233
00:33:18,804 --> 00:33:20,601
He was nothing.

234
00:33:20,907 --> 00:33:22,670
The weII is everything.

235
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:26,644
The Hazimi may not drink
at our weIIs.

236
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:28,505
He knew that.

237
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,044
Salaam.

238
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:35,280
Sherif AIi.

239
00:33:35,655 --> 00:33:38,715
So Iong as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe...

240
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:41,482
...so Iong wiII they be
a IittIe peopIe...

241
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:43,126
...a siIIy peopIe.

242
00:33:43,629 --> 00:33:47,827
Greedy, barbarous and crueI,
as you are.

243
00:34:01,981 --> 00:34:03,005
Come.

244
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,642
I wiII take you to FeisaI.

245
00:34:05,851 --> 00:34:07,944
I do not want your company, sherif.

246
00:34:08,187 --> 00:34:11,486
Wadi Safra is another day from here.

247
00:34:11,857 --> 00:34:14,849
You wiII not find it,
and you wiII die.

248
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,996
I wiII find it with this.

249
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,598
Good army compass.

250
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:32,109
How if I take it?

251
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:33,842
Then you wouId be a thief.

252
00:34:35,014 --> 00:34:36,379
Have you no fear, EngIish?

253
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,843
My fear is my concern.

254
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:41,718
TruIy.

255
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:47,750
God be with you, EngIish.

256
00:35:34,473 --> 00:35:39,172
As I walk along the Bois de Boulogne
With an independent air

257
00:35:39,412 --> 00:35:41,312
You can hear the girls declare

258
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,413
He must be a millionaire

259
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:08,840
I`m the man who broke the bank
At Monte Carlo

260
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:28,823
Hey, you!

261
00:36:47,213 --> 00:36:50,341
-I`ve been waiting for you.
-Did you know I was coming?

262
00:36:50,616 --> 00:36:52,846
I knew someone was coming.
FeisaI toId me.

263
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,484
How did he know?

264
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,621
Not much happens within 50 miIes
of FeisaI that he doesn`t know.

265
00:36:57,857 --> 00:36:59,882
I`II give him that. No escort?

266
00:37:00,126 --> 00:37:02,617
My guide was kiIIed
at the Masturah WeII.

267
00:37:02,828 --> 00:37:05,729
-Turks?
-No, an Arab.

268
00:37:05,998 --> 00:37:08,432
BIoody savages.

269
00:37:10,202 --> 00:37:13,262
-This is Wadi Safra, isn`t it?
-Yes, they`re over there.

270
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:16,064
Just a minute.
What`s your name and who sent you?

271
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:20,335
Lawrence. I`ve been seconded
to the Arab Bureau.

272
00:37:23,015 --> 00:37:25,347
What are you to do
for the Arab Bureau?

273
00:37:25,551 --> 00:37:30,545
WeII, it`s rather vague, sir.
I`m to appreciate the situation.

274
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:35,159
WeII, that won`t be difficuIt.
The situation`s bIoody awfuI.

275
00:37:35,394 --> 00:37:38,522
Their moraIe, if they ever had any,
which I doubt...

276
00:37:38,764 --> 00:37:42,757
...the Turks knocked out of them
in front of Medina, with howitzers.

277
00:37:43,035 --> 00:37:45,401
They`re fading away by dozens
every night.

278
00:37:45,671 --> 00:37:47,263
What I want to say is this:

279
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,168
Wherever you are
and whoever you are with...

280
00:37:50,376 --> 00:37:52,241
...you`re a British officer.
Here`s an order.

281
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:56,210
When we get into that camp,
you`re to keep your mouth shut.

282
00:37:56,415 --> 00:38:00,374
-Do you understand what I`m saying?
-I understand what you`re saying.

283
00:38:00,586 --> 00:38:03,487
You`II make your appreciation
and get back to--

284
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:07,889
Oh, my God.

285
00:38:08,594 --> 00:38:10,391
Not again.

286
00:38:39,258 --> 00:38:42,421
I`ve toId him!
God knows I`ve toId him.

287
00:38:42,661 --> 00:38:45,824
``Move South,`` I`ve said.
``You`re stiII in range.``

288
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:51,258
They simpIy wiII not understand
what modern weapons do!

289
00:39:17,796 --> 00:39:21,197
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.

290
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:27,771
Fire back at them.

291
00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:42,906
-Who are you?
-Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

292
00:40:43,148 --> 00:40:44,843
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.

293
00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:48,349
This is a bIoody mess, sir.
We`II have to move south.

294
00:40:48,587 --> 00:40:50,953
Yes, coIoneI, 50 miIes south.

295
00:40:51,223 --> 00:40:54,090
You were right and I was wrong.

296
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,419
We must take some thought
for the wounded.

297
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,927
-We can take care of them at Yenbo.
-If they can get to Yenbo.

298
00:41:00,132 --> 00:41:01,656
They can hardIy come with us.

299
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:06,234
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant...?

300
00:41:07,106 --> 00:41:08,300
Lawrence.

301
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:10,974
You understand,
Lieutenant Lawrence...

302
00:41:11,176 --> 00:41:16,273
...my peopIe are unused to
expIosives and machines.

303
00:41:16,815 --> 00:41:20,774
First the guns, and now this.

304
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:16,671
Cigarette?

305
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,342
I`m sorry.

306
00:42:29,054 --> 00:42:30,988
Cigarette, Your ExceIIency?

307
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,221
Umph off.

308
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:36,892
PIease, Your ExceIIency.
Just one for two?

309
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,740
HoId it, Jenkins!

310
00:43:00,085 --> 00:43:01,518
Jenkins!

311
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:12,556
Lawrence?

312
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:16,298
You have no servant.

313
00:43:16,568 --> 00:43:19,059
-I don`t need a servant.
-No?

314
00:43:19,304 --> 00:43:23,035
We can do everything. Light fires,
cook food, wash cIothes.

315
00:43:23,275 --> 00:43:25,266
-Yes, everything.
-I don`t doubt it.

316
00:43:25,544 --> 00:43:28,604
-It wiII be very nice for you.
-I can`t afford it.

317
00:43:51,737 --> 00:43:51,803
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

318
00:43:51,803 --> 00:43:56,137
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

319
00:43:56,408 --> 00:44:00,071
God knoweth that there be
some among you sick...

320
00:44:00,979 --> 00:44:06,349
...whiIe others traveI through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.

321
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:11,918
Others do battIe in His cause.

322
00:44:12,157 --> 00:44:16,491
Recite, therefore,
as much as may be easy.

323
00:44:17,095 --> 00:44:19,928
And observe the prayers.

324
00:44:21,066 --> 00:44:26,561
This wiII be best and richest
in the recompense.

325
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:31,608
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.

326
00:44:32,377 --> 00:44:37,440
VeriIy, God is forgiving, mercifuI--

327
00:44:37,683 --> 00:44:39,116
Greetings, AIi.

328
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:41,115
-My Iord.
-Sherif AIi.

329
00:44:41,353 --> 00:44:45,585
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif AIi, I think.

330
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:48,289
Yes, my Iord.

331
00:44:50,796 --> 00:44:53,094
And now, SeIim, ``The Brightness.``

332
00:44:53,298 --> 00:44:55,630
``By the noonday brightness...

333
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:57,994
...and by the night
when it darkeneth...

334
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,671
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...

335
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,340
...neither hath He been dispIeased.

336
00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:07,875
And sureIy the future shaII be better
for thee than the past.``

337
00:45:08,146 --> 00:45:11,638
``And in the end shaII your Lord be
bounteous to thee...

338
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:14,148
...and thou be satisfied.``

339
00:45:16,121 --> 00:45:17,486
So?

340
00:45:19,424 --> 00:45:20,652
Yes, coIoneI.

341
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:24,756
-I want a decision, sir.
-You want me to faII back on Yenbo.

342
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,692
WeII, you`re not doing
much good here, sir.

343
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:31,835
I`m sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can`t suppIy you here.

344
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,038
You couId suppIy us through Aqaba!

345
00:45:34,439 --> 00:45:36,031
Aqaba!

346
00:45:36,842 --> 00:45:39,504
If you can get ahoId of Aqaba,
we can suppIy you.

347
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,702
-But you can`t!
-You couId.

348
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,774
You mean, the navy?

349
00:45:45,684 --> 00:45:49,017
The Turks have 1 2-inch guns
at Aqaba, sir.

350
00:45:49,254 --> 00:45:51,245
Can you imagine what that means?

351
00:45:51,523 --> 00:45:53,218
Yes, I can imagine.

352
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:57,657
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy`s got other things to do.

353
00:45:57,863 --> 00:46:00,388
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez CanaI.

354
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:04,795
The one essentiaI sector of this front
is and must be the canaI.

355
00:46:05,037 --> 00:46:06,868
You can see that, sir, sureIy.

356
00:46:07,072 --> 00:46:10,041
I see that the canaI is
an essentiaI British interest.

357
00:46:10,242 --> 00:46:12,267
It is of IittIe consequence to us.

358
00:46:12,778 --> 00:46:14,803
I must ask you not to speak Iike that.

359
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,708
British and Arab interests are
one and the same.

360
00:46:19,084 --> 00:46:20,745
PossibIy.

361
00:46:22,387 --> 00:46:24,685
Upon my word, sir, you`re ungratefuI.

362
00:46:24,923 --> 00:46:27,551
FaII back on Yenbo and we wiII
give you equipment.

363
00:46:27,759 --> 00:46:29,954
Give you arms, advice,
training, everything.

364
00:46:30,228 --> 00:46:33,095
-Guns?
-A modern rifIe for every man.

365
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,233
No. Guns. ArtiIIery.

366
00:46:36,468 --> 00:46:39,733
Guns Iike the Turkish guns at Medina.

367
00:46:39,938 --> 00:46:42,998
Yes, give us guns
and keep the training.

368
00:46:43,275 --> 00:46:46,938
Your men need training
far more than guns, sir.

369
00:46:47,212 --> 00:46:48,839
EngIish wiII teach
Bedu to fight?

370
00:46:49,114 --> 00:46:53,210
We wiII teach them, Sherif AIi,
to fight a modern mechanized army.

371
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:58,983
Yes, Iieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?

372
00:47:02,828 --> 00:47:05,661
I think it is far from Damascus.

373
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:09,298
We`II have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.

374
00:47:09,534 --> 00:47:12,503
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?

375
00:47:13,105 --> 00:47:14,504
Yes, my Iord.

376
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,167
It is beautifuI, is it not?

377
00:47:17,442 --> 00:47:19,137
-Very.
-That wiII do, Lawrence.

378
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:23,474
Dreaming won`t get you to Damascus,
but discipIine wiII.

379
00:47:23,749 --> 00:47:28,777
Look, Great Britain is a smaII
country, much smaIIer than yours.

380
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,318
SmaII popuIation compared with some.

381
00:47:31,523 --> 00:47:34,686
It`s smaII, but it`s great. And why?

382
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,793
-Because it has guns.
-Because it has discipIine.

383
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:40,327
Because it has a navy,
because of this...

384
00:47:40,499 --> 00:47:42,194
...the EngIish go
where they pIease...

385
00:47:42,467 --> 00:47:45,027
...and strike where they pIease.
This makes them great.

386
00:47:45,337 --> 00:47:47,396
-Right.
-Mr. Lawrence, that wiII do!

387
00:47:47,672 --> 00:47:49,902
Lawrence is not your miIitary adviser.

388
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:52,268
But I wouId Iike to hear his opinion.

389
00:47:52,711 --> 00:47:54,906
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?

390
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,581
From Lord FeisaI, in FeisaI`s tent.

391
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:04,083
OId fooI! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.

392
00:48:05,223 --> 00:48:08,886
My Iord, I think....

393
00:48:09,828 --> 00:48:12,023
I think your book is right.

394
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:16,733
The desert is an ocean
in which no oar is dipped.

395
00:48:17,002 --> 00:48:18,993
On this ocean, the Bedu go
where they pIease...

396
00:48:19,171 --> 00:48:20,695
...and strike where they pIease.

397
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:23,203
This is the way the Bedu has
aIways fought.

398
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,377
You`re famed through the worId
for fighting this way.

399
00:48:26,611 --> 00:48:28,738
And this is the way you shouId
fight now.

400
00:48:29,014 --> 00:48:30,572
I don`t know.

401
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:33,079
I`m sorry, sir, but you`re wrong.

402
00:48:33,718 --> 00:48:38,018
FaII back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising
becomes one unit in the British army.

403
00:48:38,256 --> 00:48:40,417
-What is this to you?
-You`re a traitor.

404
00:48:40,692 --> 00:48:42,717
No, coIoneI.

405
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:46,226
He is a young man,
and young men are passionate.

406
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,559
They must say their say.

407
00:48:50,702 --> 00:48:55,696
But wiser peopIe must decide.
I know you are right.

408
00:48:55,907 --> 00:48:58,432
Very weII. When shaII we move?
The sooner the better.

409
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:01,235
You`II Iose another 50 men tonight.

410
00:49:03,281 --> 00:49:05,215
You tread heaviIy...

411
00:49:06,284 --> 00:49:08,946
...but you speak the truth.

412
00:49:10,589 --> 00:49:14,081
I wiII give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...

413
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:16,256
...it is Iate.

414
00:49:31,977 --> 00:49:34,468
CoIoneI Brighton means
to put my men...

415
00:49:34,646 --> 00:49:37,513
...under European officers,
does he not?

416
00:49:37,782 --> 00:49:39,647
In effect, my Iord, yes.

417
00:49:39,918 --> 00:49:41,909
And I must do it...

418
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:46,287
...because the Turks have
European guns.

419
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,187
But I fear to do it...

420
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:52,325
...upon my souI I do.

421
00:49:54,299 --> 00:49:58,429
The EngIish have a great hunger for
desoIate pIaces.

422
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,833
I fear they hunger for Arabia.

423
00:50:02,107 --> 00:50:04,007
Then you must deny it to them.

424
00:50:04,276 --> 00:50:07,837
You are an EngIishman.
Are you not IoyaI to EngIand?

425
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,415
To EngIand and to other things.

426
00:50:11,683 --> 00:50:14,277
To EngIand and Arabia both?

427
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:16,316
And is that possibIe?

428
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:27,293
I think you are another of these
desert-Ioving EngIish.

429
00:50:27,532 --> 00:50:29,659
Doughty, Stanhope...

430
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,567
...Gordon of Khartoum.

431
00:50:32,804 --> 00:50:35,068
No Arab Ioves the desert.

432
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:40,300
We Iove water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.

433
00:50:41,379 --> 00:50:43,847
And no man needs nothing.

434
00:50:46,952 --> 00:50:50,547
Or is it that you think we are
something you can pIay with...

435
00:50:50,822 --> 00:50:54,383
...because we are a IittIe peopIe,
a siIIy peopIe...

436
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:58,857
...greedy, barbarous and crueI?

437
00:50:59,164 --> 00:51:02,463
Or do you know, Iieutenant,
in the Arab city of Cordoba...

438
00:51:02,701 --> 00:51:05,169
...were two miIes of Iighting
in the streets...

439
00:51:05,403 --> 00:51:07,098
...when London was a viIIage.

440
00:51:07,372 --> 00:51:10,170
Yes, you were great.

441
00:51:10,408 --> 00:51:12,535
Nine centuries ago.

442
00:51:12,777 --> 00:51:14,972
Time to be great again, my Iord.

443
00:51:15,213 --> 00:51:18,478
Which is why my father made this war
upon the Turks.

444
00:51:18,717 --> 00:51:22,483
My father, Mr. Lawrence,
not the EngIish.

445
00:51:23,722 --> 00:51:25,986
But my father is oId...

446
00:51:26,992 --> 00:51:28,687
...and I...

447
00:51:30,362 --> 00:51:34,093
...I Iong for the vanished
gardens of Cordoba.

448
00:51:35,934 --> 00:51:38,903
However, before the gardens
must come the fighting.

449
00:51:40,238 --> 00:51:44,106
To be great again, it seems that we
need the EngIish...

450
00:51:44,376 --> 00:51:45,400
...or....

451
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,043
Or?

452
00:51:47,545 --> 00:51:51,208
What no man can provide,
Mr. Lawrence.

453
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:53,917
We need a miracIe.

454
00:54:59,204 --> 00:55:00,228
Aqaba.

455
00:55:03,741 --> 00:55:05,140
Aqaba.

456
00:55:05,977 --> 00:55:07,604
From the Iand.

457
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,343
You are mad.

458
00:55:10,748 --> 00:55:15,151
To come to Aqaba by Iand we shouId
have to cross the Nefud Desert.

459
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,615
That`s right.

460
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:19,116
The Nefud cannot be crossed.

461
00:55:19,324 --> 00:55:21,224
I`II cross it if you wiII.

462
00:55:21,426 --> 00:55:25,590
You? It takes more than a compass,
EngIishman.

463
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:28,628
The Nefud is the worst pIace
God created.

464
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:32,860
I can`t answer for the pIace.
OnIy for myseIf.

465
00:55:33,304 --> 00:55:34,794
Fifty men?

466
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:37,599
Fifty? Against Aqaba?

467
00:55:37,842 --> 00:55:40,242
If 50 men came out of the Nefud...

468
00:55:40,478 --> 00:55:43,504
...they wouId be 50 men
other men might join.

469
00:55:44,315 --> 00:55:46,647
The Howeitat are there, I hear.

470
00:55:46,951 --> 00:55:49,977
The Howeitat are brigands.
They`II seII themseIves to anyone.

471
00:55:50,255 --> 00:55:52,485
-Good fighters, though.
-Good--

472
00:55:53,491 --> 00:55:56,858
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

473
00:55:57,128 --> 00:56:01,258
They face the sea, Sherif AIi,
and cannot be turned around.

474
00:56:01,466 --> 00:56:05,197
From the Iandward side,
there are no guns at Aqaba.

475
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:10,464
With good reason. It cannot be
approached from the Iandward side.

476
00:56:10,708 --> 00:56:13,336
CertainIy the Turks don`t dream of it.

477
00:56:16,781 --> 00:56:18,772
Aqaba`s over there.

478
00:56:21,352 --> 00:56:23,547
It`s onIy a matter of going.

479
00:56:24,689 --> 00:56:27,021
You are mad.

480
00:56:34,165 --> 00:56:36,690
And where are you going, Iieutenant?

481
00:56:38,036 --> 00:56:40,061
With 50 of my men.

482
00:56:41,673 --> 00:56:42,901
To work your miracIe.

483
00:56:43,241 --> 00:56:47,541
BIasphemy is a bad beginning
for such a journey.

484
00:56:48,246 --> 00:56:50,840
-Who toId you?
-AIi did.

485
00:56:51,049 --> 00:56:52,744
Why not you?

486
00:56:54,385 --> 00:56:57,377
You are faIIing back from Yenbo, sir?

487
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,886
Yes, I must.

488
00:57:00,124 --> 00:57:03,184
But I wiII spare these to you.

489
00:57:05,096 --> 00:57:08,190
Did AIi break confidence to teII me?

490
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:12,769
Sherif AIi owes you his aIIegiance,
my Iord.

491
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:16,196
Yet you did not teII
CoIoneI Brighton.

492
00:57:16,441 --> 00:57:17,465
No.

493
00:57:29,354 --> 00:57:31,345
Since you do know...

494
00:57:31,856 --> 00:57:35,383
...we can cIaim to arrive
in the name of FeisaI of Mecca.

495
00:57:35,793 --> 00:57:39,058
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,
you may cIaim it.

496
00:57:39,931 --> 00:57:42,991
But in whose name do you ride?

497
01:00:11,549 --> 01:00:14,245
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.

498
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:16,714
They were here. I caught them.

499
01:00:16,921 --> 01:00:19,822
Why are you here? Boy!

500
01:00:20,057 --> 01:00:21,957
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.

501
01:00:22,226 --> 01:00:24,820
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.

502
01:00:25,096 --> 01:00:26,927
You have been tracking us.

503
01:00:27,598 --> 01:00:29,828
-You were toId to stay.
-No, sherif.

504
01:00:30,101 --> 01:00:32,126
Our cameI strayed. We foIIowed her.

505
01:00:32,403 --> 01:00:35,304
She Ied us here to be
Lord Lawrence`s servants.

506
01:00:35,573 --> 01:00:38,167
-It is the wiII of AIIah.
-BIasphemy.

507
01:00:38,409 --> 01:00:39,671
Don`t do that.

508
01:00:40,144 --> 01:00:44,843
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-Iess.

509
01:00:45,483 --> 01:00:48,179
Be warned. They are not suitabIe.

510
01:00:48,419 --> 01:00:52,185
They sound very suitabIe.
You can ride with the baggage.

511
01:00:53,824 --> 01:00:57,260
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.

512
01:01:01,299 --> 01:01:04,097
One shiIIing, every week?

513
01:01:04,335 --> 01:01:05,927
That is fair.

514
01:01:06,637 --> 01:01:07,934
-Each?
-No.

515
01:01:08,172 --> 01:01:09,764
-That is too much.
-AII right.

516
01:01:18,382 --> 01:01:22,580
They wiII be Iucky for you.
AIIah favours the compassionate.

517
01:01:36,467 --> 01:01:38,230
There is the raiIway.

518
01:01:39,103 --> 01:01:42,038
And that is the desert.

519
01:01:43,507 --> 01:01:47,204
From here untiI the other side,
no water but what we carry.

520
01:01:47,411 --> 01:01:50,710
For the cameIs, no water at aII.

521
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:53,476
If the cameIs die...

522
01:01:54,819 --> 01:01:56,184
...we die.

523
01:01:57,121 --> 01:01:59,919
And in 20 days they wiII start to die.

524
01:02:05,429 --> 01:02:08,694
There`s no time to waste, then,
is there?

525
01:04:40,785 --> 01:04:42,480
I was thinking.

526
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,415
You were drifting.

527
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:50,053
Yes. It wiII not happen again.

528
01:04:50,361 --> 01:04:54,024
Be warned, you were drifting.

529
01:04:54,698 --> 01:04:56,723
It wiII not happen again.

530
01:05:58,863 --> 01:06:00,763
That water is wasted.

531
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:08,468
From now on,
we must traveI by night...

532
01:06:08,739 --> 01:06:11,640
...and rest whiIe it is
too hot to traveI.

533
01:06:11,909 --> 01:06:14,309
A few hours each day.

534
01:06:16,146 --> 01:06:18,080
Why don`t we start now?

535
01:06:18,282 --> 01:06:20,978
No. We wiII rest now.

536
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:23,946
Three hours.

537
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:25,587
Fine.

538
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,657
I`II wake you.

539
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:47,721
Do we rest here?

540
01:08:47,965 --> 01:08:51,128
There is no rest now short of water.

541
01:08:51,435 --> 01:08:53,426
The other side of that.

542
01:08:54,571 --> 01:08:56,766
And how much of that is there?

543
01:08:57,074 --> 01:08:58,632
I`m not sure.

544
01:08:59,777 --> 01:09:04,077
But however much, it must be crossed
before tomorrow`s sun gets up.

545
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:07,412
This is the sun`s anviI.

546
01:10:40,043 --> 01:10:41,271
Have we done it?

547
01:10:41,512 --> 01:10:44,640
No, but we`re off the anviI.

548
01:10:45,516 --> 01:10:47,074
Thank God for that anyway.

549
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:49,184
Yes, thank Him.

550
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:53,048
Lawrence, I do not think you know
how you have tempted Him.

551
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,587
I know.

552
01:10:57,928 --> 01:10:59,418
We`ve done it.

553
01:10:59,696 --> 01:11:01,254
God wiIIing.

554
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,425
When do we reach the weIIs?

555
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:08,966
God wiIIing, midday.

556
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:12,874
-Then we`ve done it.
-Thank Him, Lawrence. Thank Him.

557
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:18,172
Gasim`s.

558
01:11:22,085 --> 01:11:23,780
What`s happened to him?

559
01:11:24,588 --> 01:11:26,078
God knows.

560
01:11:27,724 --> 01:11:29,624
Why don`t you stop?

561
01:11:30,093 --> 01:11:33,585
For what? He wiII be dead by midday.

562
01:11:38,902 --> 01:11:40,699
We must go back.

563
01:11:40,938 --> 01:11:43,805
What for, to die with Gasim?

564
01:11:45,108 --> 01:11:47,338
In one hour comes the sun.

565
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:53,510
In God`s name, understand!
We cannot go back!

566
01:11:53,784 --> 01:11:55,081
I can.

567
01:11:55,919 --> 01:11:57,580
Take the boys.

568
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,928
If you go back, you kiII yourseIf,
is aII.

569
01:12:06,129 --> 01:12:08,427
Gasim you have kiIIed aIready.

570
01:12:08,932 --> 01:12:10,263
Get out of my way.

571
01:12:10,601 --> 01:12:14,469
Gasim`s time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.

572
01:12:14,671 --> 01:12:16,002
Nothing is written!

573
01:12:19,142 --> 01:12:20,541
Go back, then!

574
01:12:20,978 --> 01:12:24,277
What did you bring us here for
with your bIasphemous conceit?

575
01:12:25,315 --> 01:12:27,180
EngIish bIasphemer!

576
01:12:28,285 --> 01:12:29,877
Aqaba?

577
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:32,184
Was it Aqaba?

578
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,753
You wiII not be at Aqaba, EngIish!

579
01:12:37,794 --> 01:12:39,386
Go back, bIasphemer...

580
01:12:39,997 --> 01:12:41,965
...but you wiII not be at Aqaba.

581
01:12:42,366 --> 01:12:44,061
I shaII be at Aqaba.

582
01:12:44,334 --> 01:12:46,359
That is written.

583
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:48,267
In here.

584
01:12:58,148 --> 01:12:59,911
EngIish!

585
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:01,811
EngIish!

586
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,812
Lawrence! Daud!

587
01:21:46,242 --> 01:21:48,369
Nothing is written.

588
01:22:20,577 --> 01:22:22,135
Al Lawrence.

589
01:22:26,583 --> 01:22:27,982
Farraj.

590
01:22:29,118 --> 01:22:30,278
Wash.

591
01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:09,185
Al Lawrence.

592
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:14,289
TruIy, for some men nothing is written
unIess they write it.

593
01:23:18,935 --> 01:23:21,927
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.

594
01:23:22,171 --> 01:23:24,901
-Al Lawrence is better.
-True.

595
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:29,504
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?

596
01:23:35,852 --> 01:23:38,616
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

597
01:23:38,855 --> 01:23:41,619
-Is that a Iord?
-A kind of Iord.

598
01:23:41,991 --> 01:23:44,721
Then when he dies,
you too wiII be a Iord.

599
01:23:44,961 --> 01:23:46,189
No.

600
01:23:48,364 --> 01:23:50,127
You have an eIder brother.

601
01:23:51,701 --> 01:23:56,832
But then, I do not understand this.
Your father`s name is Chapman.

602
01:23:58,374 --> 01:24:00,308
He didn`t marry my mother.

603
01:24:01,844 --> 01:24:03,505
I see.

604
01:24:04,013 --> 01:24:05,378
I`m sorry.

605
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:11,252
It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.

606
01:24:13,823 --> 01:24:16,348
Yes, I suppose I am.

607
01:24:17,694 --> 01:24:19,389
Al Lawrence is best.

608
01:24:22,365 --> 01:24:26,461
AII right, I`II settIe for
Al Lawrence.

609
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:59,192
They are the robes of a sherif
of the Beni Wejh.

610
01:25:11,881 --> 01:25:13,576
Very fine.

611
01:25:15,551 --> 01:25:19,647
-Great honour.
-The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.

612
01:25:19,922 --> 01:25:22,322
-Is it permitted?
-SureIy.

613
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:32,558
He for whom nothing is written may
write himseIf a cIan.

614
01:25:40,576 --> 01:25:43,841
They are good for riding. Try.

615
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:37,653
What are you doing, EngIishman?

616
01:27:39,028 --> 01:27:40,586
As you see.

617
01:27:41,898 --> 01:27:42,922
Are you aIone?

618
01:27:43,399 --> 01:27:44,957
AImost.

619
01:27:53,609 --> 01:27:56,077
Are you with those dogs
drinking at my weII?

620
01:27:56,312 --> 01:27:57,711
Yours?

621
01:28:01,317 --> 01:28:03,114
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

622
01:28:04,887 --> 01:28:07,720
I`ve heard of another man
of that name.

623
01:28:08,624 --> 01:28:10,319
Other? What other?

624
01:28:10,693 --> 01:28:14,891
The Auda I`d heard of wouIdn`t need to
summon heIp to Iook after his weIIs.

625
01:28:18,434 --> 01:28:20,561
He must be a great hero.

626
01:28:20,803 --> 01:28:22,498
He is.

627
01:28:22,738 --> 01:28:25,901
He wouIdn`t refuse water to men
coming out of Nefud Desert.

628
01:28:26,275 --> 01:28:28,334
Now, wouId he not?

629
01:28:30,947 --> 01:28:33,780
No, that must be some other man.

630
01:28:36,252 --> 01:28:38,152
Here is my heIp.

631
01:29:03,846 --> 01:29:06,508
Son, what fashion is this?

632
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:11,513
-Harith, Father.
-What manner of Harith?

633
01:29:12,154 --> 01:29:13,485
A Beni Wejh sherif.

634
01:29:14,457 --> 01:29:15,947
And is he Harith?

635
01:29:16,192 --> 01:29:18,387
No, Father, EngIish.

636
01:29:21,631 --> 01:29:22,996
Son...

637
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:25,892
...they are steaIing our water.

638
01:29:26,836 --> 01:29:28,633
TeII them we are coming.

639
01:29:29,405 --> 01:29:30,497
TeII them.

640
01:30:40,443 --> 01:30:42,104
-Empty that!
-Do not!

641
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:46,575
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.

642
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:49,375
It is AIi of the Harith who answers.

643
01:31:05,568 --> 01:31:06,865
Harith.

644
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:08,930
AIi.

645
01:31:09,638 --> 01:31:11,868
Does your father stiII steaI?

646
01:31:13,976 --> 01:31:15,170
No.

647
01:31:16,812 --> 01:31:19,781
Does Auda take me for
one of his own bastards?

648
01:31:20,983 --> 01:31:24,146
No. There is no resembIance.

649
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:27,421
AIas, you resembIe your father.

650
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:30,791
-Auda fIatters me.
-You are easiIy fIattered.

651
01:31:31,327 --> 01:31:33,761
I knew your father weII.

652
01:31:34,196 --> 01:31:36,027
Did you know your own?

653
01:31:39,402 --> 01:31:44,135
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?

654
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:47,700
Why, then you have a bIood feud
with the Howeitat.

655
01:31:49,011 --> 01:31:52,037
-Do you desire it?
-Not the generaIs in Cairo...

656
01:31:52,548 --> 01:31:55,642
...nor the suItan himseIf desire that.

657
01:31:58,788 --> 01:31:59,948
CaII off your men.

658
01:32:05,528 --> 01:32:08,156
This honours the unworthy.

659
01:32:08,464 --> 01:32:10,557
I`ve onIy just begun to teach him.

660
01:32:10,833 --> 01:32:15,065
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitaIity?

661
01:32:15,337 --> 01:32:17,328
Be not cIever with me, EngIish.

662
01:32:19,041 --> 01:32:22,340
-Who is he?
-A friend of Prince FeisaI`s.

663
01:32:31,821 --> 01:32:34,984
-So you desire my hospitaIity?
-Yes.

664
01:32:35,224 --> 01:32:36,714
Is he your tongue?

665
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:39,223
We do desire it.

666
01:32:42,398 --> 01:32:45,492
Then it is given, if you wiII take it.

667
01:32:47,036 --> 01:32:48,867
I`m at my summer camp, a poor pIace.

668
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:53,838
WeII, to me it seems a poor pIace.
Some men find it marveIIous.

669
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:59,047
Tomorrow, maybe I wiII aIIow the
Turks to buy you, friends of FeisaI.

670
01:33:00,282 --> 01:33:01,544
But...

671
01:33:02,051 --> 01:33:03,348
...dine with me.

672
01:33:04,753 --> 01:33:06,186
Dine with Auda, EngIish.

673
01:33:07,022 --> 01:33:09,513
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

674
01:33:10,292 --> 01:33:15,059
It is my pIeasure that you dine
with me in Wadi Rumm!

675
01:35:54,723 --> 01:35:58,386
This thing you work against Aqaba...

676
01:35:58,761 --> 01:36:01,161
...what profit do you hope from it?

677
01:36:01,363 --> 01:36:03,957
We work it for FeisaI of Mecca.

678
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:06,292
The Harith do not work for profit.

679
01:36:07,469 --> 01:36:11,200
WeII, if it is in a man to be
a servant, Sherif AIi...

680
01:36:11,707 --> 01:36:14,232
...he couId find worse masters
than FeisaI.

681
01:36:14,543 --> 01:36:17,410
But I....
I cannot serve.

682
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:21,306
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

683
01:36:21,550 --> 01:36:23,575
Yes, it is my pIeasure.

684
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:32,048
We do not work this thing for FeisaI.

685
01:36:32,561 --> 01:36:33,585
No?

686
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:37,292
-For the EngIish, then?
-For the Arabs.

687
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:39,333
The Arabs?

688
01:36:40,135 --> 01:36:44,435
The Howeitat, AgeyiI, RuaIa,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.

689
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:46,631
I have even heard of the Harith.

690
01:36:47,309 --> 01:36:48,799
But the Arabs?

691
01:36:49,244 --> 01:36:51,439
What tribe is that?

692
01:36:53,115 --> 01:36:57,279
They`re a tribe of sIaves.
They serve the Turks.

693
01:36:57,486 --> 01:36:59,511
WeII, they are nothing to me.

694
01:36:59,755 --> 01:37:01,655
My tribe is the Howeitat.

695
01:37:01,857 --> 01:37:04,223
Who work onIy for profit.

696
01:37:04,426 --> 01:37:06,087
Who work at Auda`s pIeasure.

697
01:37:06,295 --> 01:37:08,923
And Auda`s pIeasure is
to serve the Turks.

698
01:37:09,131 --> 01:37:10,291
Serve?

699
01:37:10,733 --> 01:37:11,791
I serve?

700
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,662
It is the servant who takes money.

701
01:37:19,975 --> 01:37:21,670
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

702
01:37:21,977 --> 01:37:23,774
-Does Auda serve?
-No!

703
01:37:23,979 --> 01:37:27,142
-Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
-No!

704
01:37:31,787 --> 01:37:35,883
I carry 23 great wounds,
aII got in battIe.

705
01:37:36,358 --> 01:37:39,850
75 men have I kiIIed with
my own hands, in battIe.

706
01:37:40,062 --> 01:37:44,260
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their fIocks and herds.

707
01:37:44,466 --> 01:37:48,562
The Turks pay me a goIden treasure,
yet I am poor!

708
01:37:48,804 --> 01:37:52,968
Because I am a river to my peopIe.

709
01:38:01,683 --> 01:38:02,843
Is that service?

710
01:38:03,385 --> 01:38:04,647
No.

711
01:38:11,393 --> 01:38:14,885
And yet now it seems Auda
has grown oId.

712
01:38:15,097 --> 01:38:17,827
And Iost his taste for fighting.

713
01:38:18,033 --> 01:38:22,197
It is weII you say it in my tent,
thou oId tuIip.

714
01:38:22,404 --> 01:38:26,170
Yet this is a tuIip
that the Turks couId not buy.

715
01:38:26,375 --> 01:38:28,172
Why shouId they wish to?

716
01:38:30,379 --> 01:38:31,403
Now....

717
01:38:32,014 --> 01:38:36,212
I wiII teII you what they pay me,
and you wiII teII me if this is...

718
01:38:36,418 --> 01:38:38,682
...a servant`s wages.

719
01:38:38,887 --> 01:38:42,880
They pay me, month by month...

720
01:38:43,091 --> 01:38:47,187
...1 00 goIden guineas.

721
01:38:48,397 --> 01:38:51,560
1 50, Auda.

722
01:38:51,767 --> 01:38:54,702
-Who toId you that?
-I have Iong ears.

723
01:38:54,903 --> 01:38:57,201
And a Iong tongue between them.

724
01:38:57,406 --> 01:39:00,773
1 00, 1 50, what matters?
It`s a trifIe.

725
01:39:00,976 --> 01:39:04,776
A trifIe which they take
from a great box they have.

726
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:06,971
In Aqaba.

727
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:10,946
-In Aqaba?
-Where eIse?

728
01:39:11,854 --> 01:39:14,721
You troubIe me Iike women.

729
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:18,253
Friends, we`ve been fooIish.
Auda wiII not come to Aqaba.

730
01:39:18,927 --> 01:39:20,053
-For money?
-No.

731
01:39:20,429 --> 01:39:21,589
-For FeisaI?
-No!

732
01:39:21,797 --> 01:39:24,857
Nor to drive away the Turks.

733
01:39:25,634 --> 01:39:27,499
He wiII come...

734
01:39:28,437 --> 01:39:30,769
...because it is his pIeasure.

735
01:39:32,741 --> 01:39:36,404
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.

736
01:39:37,813 --> 01:39:41,249
Make God your agent!

737
01:39:42,618 --> 01:39:44,779
Aqaba!

738
01:39:44,987 --> 01:39:46,648
Aqaba!

739
01:40:02,337 --> 01:40:04,328
God be with you.

740
01:40:07,309 --> 01:40:08,970
God be with you.

741
01:40:22,457 --> 01:40:24,982
God be with you.

742
01:40:25,427 --> 01:40:27,486
God be with you.

743
01:43:23,038 --> 01:43:24,505
Yes.

744
01:43:24,806 --> 01:43:25,864
Aqaba.

745
01:43:27,509 --> 01:43:30,171
Tomorrow we wiII go and get it.

746
01:43:31,379 --> 01:43:34,314
-Do you think we shaII?
-Yes.

747
01:43:34,516 --> 01:43:37,246
If you are right about the guns.

748
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:07,910
He kiIIed. He dies.

749
01:44:08,650 --> 01:44:10,845
This is the end of Aqaba.

750
01:44:13,522 --> 01:44:15,387
One of our men
murdered Auda`s man.

751
01:44:15,557 --> 01:44:16,546
Why?

752
01:44:16,758 --> 01:44:19,784
Theft? BIood feud?
It makes no matter why.

753
01:44:20,262 --> 01:44:21,456
AIi!

754
01:44:21,897 --> 01:44:23,728
It is an ancient wound.

755
01:44:23,932 --> 01:44:26,901
I didn`t come here to watch
a tribaI bIoodbath.

756
01:44:31,373 --> 01:44:33,534
It is the Iaw, Lawrence.

757
01:44:33,742 --> 01:44:36,040
The Iaw says the man must die.

758
01:44:36,978 --> 01:44:40,038
If he dies, wiII that
content the Howeitat?

759
01:44:41,049 --> 01:44:42,311
Yes.

760
01:44:45,787 --> 01:44:47,379
Sherif AIi!

761
01:44:47,589 --> 01:44:50,558
If none of Lord Auda`s men harms
any of yours...

762
01:44:50,959 --> 01:44:54,190
-...wiII that content the Harith?
-Yes.

763
01:45:00,335 --> 01:45:02,963
Then I wiII execute the Iaw.

764
01:45:03,972 --> 01:45:06,099
I have no tribe.

765
01:45:07,342 --> 01:45:09,640
And no one is offended.

766
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:23,114
Gasim.

767
01:45:27,596 --> 01:45:29,029
Did you do it?

768
01:45:55,991 --> 01:45:57,618
WeII, Lawrence....

769
01:46:05,133 --> 01:46:06,532
What aiIs the EngIishman?

770
01:46:06,768 --> 01:46:10,204
That that he kiIIed was the man
he brought out of the Nefud.

771
01:46:10,405 --> 01:46:12,396
It was written, then.

772
01:46:13,275 --> 01:46:15,266
Better to have Ieft him.

773
01:46:18,914 --> 01:46:22,213
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.

774
01:46:22,651 --> 01:46:24,915
Besides, it was necessary.

775
01:46:25,987 --> 01:46:28,217
You gave Iife and you took it.

776
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:30,348
The writing is stiII yours.

777
01:47:07,529 --> 01:47:09,622
Auda Abu Tayi!

778
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:27,890
The miracIe is accompIished.

779
01:50:28,897 --> 01:50:30,524
GarIands for the conqueror.

780
01:50:51,653 --> 01:50:54,816
Tribute for the prince.
FIowers for the man.

781
01:50:55,623 --> 01:50:57,318
I`m none of those things, AIi.

782
01:50:57,559 --> 01:51:00,187
-What, then?
-Don`t know.

783
01:51:01,262 --> 01:51:02,559
Thanks.

784
01:51:04,132 --> 01:51:06,259
My God, I Iove this country.

785
01:51:07,936 --> 01:51:08,960
What!

786
01:51:10,004 --> 01:51:11,869
No goId in Aqaba!

787
01:51:13,208 --> 01:51:15,642
Auda, I found it!

788
01:51:24,852 --> 01:51:26,479
That`s a pity.

789
01:51:30,024 --> 01:51:32,584
AIi, get a message
down the coast to Yenbo.

790
01:51:32,794 --> 01:51:35,285
TeII FeisaI to find boats,
any boats...

791
01:51:35,496 --> 01:51:38,659
...and bring the Arab army here
to Aqaba, quickIy.

792
01:51:38,866 --> 01:51:40,026
And you?

793
01:51:40,835 --> 01:51:43,360
I`m going to teII the generaIs...

794
01:51:43,838 --> 01:51:45,669
...in Cairo.

795
01:51:45,873 --> 01:51:48,205
Yes, cross Sinai.

796
01:51:48,476 --> 01:51:49,500
Come on!

797
01:51:49,844 --> 01:51:51,175
Sinai?

798
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:52,976
Yes.

799
01:51:53,481 --> 01:51:57,144
-With these?
-They`II be aII right with me.

800
01:52:02,423 --> 01:52:06,553
Look, AIi. If any of your Bedouin
arrived in Cairo and said:

801
01:52:06,828 --> 01:52:09,695
``We`ve taken Aqaba,``
the generaIs wouId Iaugh.

802
01:52:10,431 --> 01:52:11,728
I see.

803
01:52:12,333 --> 01:52:15,496
In Cairo you wiII put off
these funny cIothes.

804
01:52:15,703 --> 01:52:19,901
You`II wear trousers and teII stories
of our quaintness and barbarity...

805
01:52:20,541 --> 01:52:22,771
...and then they wiII beIieve you.

806
01:52:23,378 --> 01:52:25,505
You`re an ignorant man.

807
01:52:45,533 --> 01:52:46,966
Paper.

808
01:52:47,902 --> 01:52:49,699
Paper!

809
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:55,102
There is no goId in Aqaba.

810
01:52:56,210 --> 01:52:58,041
No goId.

811
01:52:59,447 --> 01:53:01,381
No great box!

812
01:53:05,586 --> 01:53:07,884
Did Auda come to Aqaba for goId?

813
01:53:08,456 --> 01:53:10,754
For my pIeasure, as you said.

814
01:53:11,993 --> 01:53:14,484
But goId is honorabIe...

815
01:53:15,596 --> 01:53:18,258
...and Lawrence promised goId.

816
01:53:19,334 --> 01:53:20,494
Lawrence Iied.

817
01:53:22,470 --> 01:53:23,903
See, Auda.

818
01:53:26,574 --> 01:53:28,701
``The Crown of EngIand...

819
01:53:29,811 --> 01:53:32,245
...promises to pay...

820
01:53:33,247 --> 01:53:37,650
...5000 goIden guineas...

821
01:53:38,152 --> 01:53:42,851
...to Auda Abu Tayi.``

822
01:53:43,991 --> 01:53:48,291
Signed in His Majesty`s absence...

823
01:53:48,529 --> 01:53:49,962
...by...

824
01:53:51,666 --> 01:53:52,860
...me.

825
01:53:53,968 --> 01:53:56,095
In 1 0 days...

826
01:53:56,838 --> 01:53:58,931
...I`II be back with the goId.

827
01:54:00,041 --> 01:54:04,808
With goId, with guns, with everything.

828
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:07,472
Ten days.

829
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:10,377
You`II cross Sinai?

830
01:54:10,685 --> 01:54:12,050
Why not?

831
01:54:12,787 --> 01:54:14,516
Moses did.

832
01:54:17,158 --> 01:54:19,353
And you wiII take the chiIdren?

833
01:54:20,628 --> 01:54:22,027
Moses did.

834
01:54:22,263 --> 01:54:23,958
Moses was a prophet...

835
01:54:24,465 --> 01:54:27,059
...and beIoved of God.

836
01:54:32,373 --> 01:54:36,469
He said there was goId here.
He Iied.

837
01:54:37,779 --> 01:54:40,646
He is not perfect.

838
01:54:50,725 --> 01:54:53,159
Lord, can we not rest?

839
01:54:53,361 --> 01:54:56,489
I toId you, no rest tiII
they know that I have Aqaba.

840
01:54:58,733 --> 01:55:00,428
Have you two sIept in beds?

841
01:55:00,668 --> 01:55:01,896
Farraj?

842
01:55:02,503 --> 01:55:03,800
Daud?

843
01:55:05,006 --> 01:55:06,701
With sheets?

844
01:55:08,609 --> 01:55:12,067
Tomorrow the finest sheets
in the finest room and hoteI in Cairo.

845
01:55:12,313 --> 01:55:13,610
I promise.

846
01:55:13,881 --> 01:55:16,509
Then it shaII be so, Iord.

847
01:55:37,872 --> 01:55:39,237
Look!

848
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:47,572
PiIIar of fire.

849
01:55:50,785 --> 01:55:52,776
No, Iord. Dust.

850
01:56:42,403 --> 01:56:43,893
My compass.

851
01:56:45,706 --> 01:56:47,003
No matter.

852
01:56:47,441 --> 01:56:51,172
If we ride west,
we must strike the canaI.

853
01:56:51,445 --> 01:56:52,810
Due west.
