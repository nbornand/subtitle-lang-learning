2
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:16,991
Darling, don't be difficult.
Let's take our sweet...

3
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:20,363
Iovely children on an outing.

4
00:05:31,813 --> 00:05:35,408
You can't do this.
I know my rights.

5
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:38,111
I have the authority to close
you down, and I'm doing just that.

6
00:05:38,186 --> 00:05:42,714
This exhibit degrades everybody who
sees it and the creature himself.

7
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,056
He is a freak!
How else will he live?

8
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:49,392
Freaks are one thing.
This is entirely different.

9
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:52,797
This is monstrous
and should not be allowed.

10
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:56,462
These officers will see to it
you're on your way soon. Good day!

11
00:05:57,972 --> 00:06:01,373
Move along please.

12
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:06,046
Hold it there, sir.

13
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:08,139
Come this way.

14
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:21,762
On the move again...

15
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:28,268
my treasure.

16
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:08,872
We'll be seeing a lot more
of these machine accidents...

17
00:07:08,943 --> 00:07:10,740
- Mr. Hodges.
- Yes, sir.

18
00:07:14,983 --> 00:07:19,317
Abominable things, these machines.
You can't reason with them.

19
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:22,385
What a mess!

20
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:28,789
Pull on the rope.

21
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:31,762
Irons, please.

22
00:07:45,713 --> 00:07:47,078
Who is it?

23
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,610
- Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
- Yes, what is it?

24
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:55,588
- I found it.
- Good. Did you see it?

25
00:07:58,793 --> 00:08:02,160
All right. I'll see you
in a moment. Thank you.

26
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,234
Who's that?

27
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:10,703
- A friend of mine.
- Oh, yes.

28
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:14,105
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

29
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:16,336
Come on, Freddie!

30
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:19,803
Nothing of any importance.

31
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,235
Can you tell me
where Cleeves Street is?

32
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:19,740
'Round back, to the left,
then to the right. Straight through.

33
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:21,240
Thank you.

34
00:10:39,587 --> 00:10:41,521
Are you the proprietor?

35
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:44,183
And who might you be, sir?

36
00:10:44,258 --> 00:10:47,227
Just one of the curious.
I'd like to see it.

37
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:53,431
I don't think so.
No, sir, we're...

38
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:56,728
closed.

39
00:10:56,804 --> 00:10:59,739
Now, I'd pay handsomely
for a private showing.

40
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:01,741
Are you the proprietor?

41
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:03,800
Handsomely?
Who sent you?

42
00:11:03,878 --> 00:11:06,506
- I beg your pardon?
- Never mind.

43
00:11:09,984 --> 00:11:13,215
I'm the owner.

44
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:35,968
Life...

45
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:41,707
is full of surprises.

46
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,943
Consider the fate...

47
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:51,814
of this creature's poor mother...

48
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:56,114
struck down...

49
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,250
in the fourth month
of her maternal condition...

50
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:02,728
by an elephant,
a wild elephant.

51
00:13:02,797 --> 00:13:04,731
Struck down...

52
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:10,527
on an uncharted African isle.

53
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:13,298
The result...

54
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:17,334
is plain to see.

55
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,846
Ladies and gentlemen...

56
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:25,211
the terrible...

57
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:29,982
Elephant Man!

58
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:46,636
- Stand up.
- Stand up!

59
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:54,647
Turn around.

60
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:57,445
Turn around! Turn around!

61
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:41,552
Yes...

62
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:44,427
you'll bring him to me
tomorrow morning at 10:00, Mr... .

63
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:46,295
Bytes.

64
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,801
He'll be there.

65
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:50,302
Good.

66
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,267
Here's my card,
and I'll send a cab.

67
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:57,811
All right?

68
00:14:57,878 --> 00:15:00,369
We have a deal.

69
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,183
We understand each other.

70
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,787
More than money has changed hands.

71
00:15:09,857 --> 00:15:13,054
We understand each other
completely, my friend.

72
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:15,425
Yes, well, thank you, Mr. Bytes.

73
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:18,397
Tomorrow.

74
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:57,536
Cor! What a stink!

75
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:01,298
I'm looking
for Mr. Frederick Treves...

76
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,275
please, ma'am.

77
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:07,547
Very well.
I'll-I'll send for him.

78
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:11,779
Nurse...
Oh, Mr. Treves, sir, this...

79
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:14,446
- This...
- Yes. Thank you.

80
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:16,513
Yes, I was expecting him.

81
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:20,352
- Yes, are you the cab driver?
- Yes, sir.

82
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:23,989
- Anyone else with you?
- No, sir. Just this gentleman.

83
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:26,556
- Thank you for your troubles.
- Not at all, sir.

84
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:28,124
My pleasure.

85
00:16:29,203 --> 00:16:30,636
Thank you.

86
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:34,400
Will you come this way, please?

87
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,211
Mrs. Mothershead, I'll be in my
room, and I'm not to be disturbed.

88
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,874
- All right?
- Of course, sir.

89
00:16:44,985 --> 00:16:47,954
Will you come with me, please?

90
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:51,948
You heard what the doctor said!

91
00:16:57,398 --> 00:16:59,491
Go on.

92
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,373
My name is Frederick Treves...

93
00:17:40,441 --> 00:17:43,638
and I'm a surgeon here
at the London Hospital.

94
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:45,144
And...

95
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:51,049
I lecture in anatomy
at the medical college.

96
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:58,655
I'd like very much
to examine you so that...

97
00:18:00,494 --> 00:18:03,395
Would that be all right?

98
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:06,227
Please.

99
00:18:10,938 --> 00:18:13,065
First I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

100
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,305
Would that be all right?

101
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:21,408
Your owner tells me... I mean the man
who looks after you tells me...

102
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:26,385
that you're English
and your name is John Merrick.

103
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:30,588
John Merrick.
Is that right?

104
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:38,494
I tell you what.
I think I'll ask you a question...

105
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:42,002
and you shake your head
like this for "no."

106
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,034
Have you always been
the way you are now?

107
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:50,935
Are you in any pain?

108
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:56,178
Are your parents still alive?

109
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,616
Do you understand me?

110
00:18:58,686 --> 00:19:01,985
Your father and your mother,
are they dead?

111
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:05,749
Freddie, what are you doing for...

112
00:19:05,826 --> 00:19:09,956
Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry.
I had no idea you had...

113
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:14,034
Freddie, what the hell
have you got in there?

114
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:16,433
You'll know soon enough,
at the meeting of the Society.

115
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:19,370
Until then, I beg of you
not a word to anyone, please.

116
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,739
All right, if you insist. But you
must have quite a find in there.

117
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,507
- I don't know what I've got.
- Nothing of any importance, eh?

118
00:19:27,581 --> 00:19:31,142
Not a word, please, Fox.
Not a word.

119
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:35,854
All right.

120
00:19:39,827 --> 00:19:41,260
Thank you.

121
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:13,718
It's all right.

122
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,174
I think I'll examine you now.

123
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:32,568
I'll leave the questions
till later.

124
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:34,113
All right?

125
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:38,343
Will you take
your hat off now, please?

126
00:20:39,753 --> 00:20:41,880
Don't be frightened.

127
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:44,322
I simply want to look at you.

128
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:48,927
Take your hat off.
Don't be frightened.

129
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:01,499
Thank you.

130
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:03,099
Good afternoon.

131
00:21:04,178 --> 00:21:06,112
Mr. Thomas, Mr. Rogers.

132
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:14,951
Pull the curtains aside.

133
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:23,658
He is English...

134
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:26,928
he is 2 1 years of age...

135
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:29,401
and his name is John Merrick.

136
00:21:30,904 --> 00:21:34,032
Gentlemen, in the course of
my profession I have come upon...

137
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:38,340
many lamentable deformities of
the face due to injury or disease...

138
00:21:38,412 --> 00:21:39,902
as well as mutilations...

139
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,381
and contortions of the body
depending upon like causes.

140
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,645
But at no time have I met
with such...

141
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:48,586
a perverted or degraded version
of a human being as this man.

142
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:52,785
I draw your attention to the
insidious conditions affecting him.

143
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,226
- Can you see over there?
- Yes.

144
00:21:55,295 --> 00:21:58,526
Note, if you will, the
extreme enlargement of the skull...

145
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:02,126
right upper limb,
which is totally useless...

146
00:22:02,202 --> 00:22:04,693
the alarming curvature
of the spine.

147
00:22:04,772 --> 00:22:07,935
- Would you turn around, please?
- Turn around, please.

148
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:13,011
The looseness of the skin...

149
00:22:13,113 --> 00:22:18,608
and the varying fibrous tumors
that cover 90% of the body.

150
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:21,153
And there is every indication that
these afflictions have been...

151
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:25,681
in existence and have
progressed rapidly since birth.

152
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:28,421
The patient also suffers
from chronic bronchitis.

153
00:22:28,495 --> 00:22:30,486
As an interesting side note...

154
00:22:30,564 --> 00:22:32,589
in spite of the
aforementioned anomalies...

155
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:37,797
the patient's genitals remain
entirely intact and unaffected.

156
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:39,498
Thank you.

157
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:45,606
And his left arm is perfectly
normal, as you see.

158
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:50,973
So then, gentlemen, owing
to this series of conditions...

159
00:22:51,051 --> 00:22:54,282
the congenital skull exostosis,
extensive papillomatous growth...

160
00:22:54,354 --> 00:22:56,788
large pendulous masses
in connection with the skin...

161
00:22:56,857 --> 00:22:59,052
the great enlargement
of the right upper limb...

162
00:22:59,126 --> 00:23:02,254
involving all the bones, the massive
distortion of the head...

163
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:06,766
and the extensive area
covered by papillomatous growth...

164
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:10,201
the patient has been called
the Elephant Man.

165
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,703
Thank you.

166
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:42,394
You never mentioned
his mental state.

167
00:23:43,637 --> 00:23:46,105
Oh, he's an imbecile,
probably from birth.

168
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:48,106
The man's a complete idiot.

169
00:23:49,276 --> 00:23:51,210
I pray to God he's an idiot.

170
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:04,190
Where have you been?

171
00:24:34,688 --> 00:24:36,121
Out.

172
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:40,526
How can I eat
with a noise like that?

173
00:24:50,504 --> 00:24:52,062
Bytes, don't!

174
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:57,372
Where have you been?
What did you do?

175
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:05,416
- Our man is sick. Come right away.
- What is it?

176
00:25:05,485 --> 00:25:07,680
Like this.

177
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:12,751
What did you do with him?
He's been like this all night.

178
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:18,524
He was fine when he left here.
Now look at him.

179
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,294
Yes, I intend to.

180
00:25:22,102 --> 00:25:24,036
- What happened?
- He fell!

181
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:26,602
He falls.

182
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:37,416
Looks like he's had
a very severe fall.

183
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:41,683
He's a clumsy soul.

184
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:44,690
Never looks where he's going.

185
00:25:44,758 --> 00:25:49,024
But that's all right.
He has me to take care of him.

186
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:51,860
Why is he sitting up like this?
He needs rest.

187
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,195
Well, that's how he sleeps.

188
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:59,137
If he lies down,
he'll kill himself.

189
00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:02,607
His head's too big.

190
00:26:02,676 --> 00:26:06,476
All right. This man
belongs in a hospital.

191
00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:09,448
Can't you treat him here?

192
00:26:09,516 --> 00:26:12,041
Listen, he's my livelihood.

193
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:15,350
We're business partners,
he and I.

194
00:26:18,592 --> 00:26:20,583
He's the greatest freak
in the world.

195
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:24,859
Yes, now you listen. You won't have
much of a livelihood if he dies.

196
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:27,866
Now, stop wasting my time.
I'm going to fetch a cab.

197
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:30,801
I truly, truly appreciate this,
my friend.

198
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:34,466
Listen. There are a lot of things
I could do for you.

199
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:40,445
You see, I move in the proper
circles for this type of thing.

200
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:44,882
In fact, anything at all...

201
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:47,010
if you take my meaning.

202
00:26:48,488 --> 00:26:50,422
Everything will be taken care of.

203
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,424
It's good to do business with you.

204
00:27:15,482 --> 00:27:17,416
Here we go.

205
00:27:41,475 --> 00:27:43,670
All right.

206
00:28:38,165 --> 00:28:40,133
Can I have a bowl
of oatmeal, please?

207
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,963
Yes, sir.

208
00:28:42,035 --> 00:28:44,868
Breakfasting with the patients
this morning, Mr. Treves?

209
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:46,997
Yes. No, it's for a patient.

210
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:49,098
There you are, sir.

211
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:51,970
Thank you. Morning.

212
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:53,376
Morning.

213
00:28:57,484 --> 00:29:00,419
Oh, Treves! Just come here
for a moment, will you?

214
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:12,097
What's that?

215
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:17,267
Good heavens! You haven't acquired
a sudden taste for this, have you?

216
00:29:17,337 --> 00:29:20,329
- Yes, sir. It's quite nutritious.
- Possibly.

217
00:29:20,407 --> 00:29:22,671
Not quite the diet
for a grown man.

218
00:29:22,742 --> 00:29:24,175
Nurse!

219
00:29:25,178 --> 00:29:27,112
When you have a moment...

220
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:31,913
take this up to the patient
in the isolation ward, will you?

221
00:29:31,985 --> 00:29:33,680
Yes, sir.

222
00:29:35,355 --> 00:29:38,119
Don't be frightened.
He won't hurt you.

223
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:41,654
Won't he indeed!
Just a minute, Treves.

224
00:29:41,728 --> 00:29:43,992
Something I want to say to you.
Come in.

225
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:50,460
A hospital's no place for secrecy,
you know, Mr. Treves.

226
00:29:50,537 --> 00:29:54,735
Doctors spiriting hooded figures
about is apt to cause comment.

227
00:29:54,808 --> 00:29:57,038
Why wasn't this patient
properly admitted?

228
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,705
Why is he in the isolation ward?
He's not contagious, is he?

229
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:04,978
No, sir. He's got chronic bronchitis
and he's been badly beaten.

230
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:07,019
Why isn't he
in the general ward then?

231
00:30:07,921 --> 00:30:10,788
Well, sir, he's quite
seriously deformed...

232
00:30:10,857 --> 00:30:14,122
and I fear the other patients
would find him rather shocking.

233
00:30:14,194 --> 00:30:16,958
Deformed? Is that it?

234
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,158
Am I to assume then
that he is ultimately incurable?

235
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:21,165
Yes, sir.

236
00:30:21,234 --> 00:30:24,328
But you must be aware that this
hospital doesn't accept incurables.

237
00:30:24,404 --> 00:30:26,338
The rules are perfectly clear.

238
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:28,340
Yes, sir,
I'm well aware of that...

239
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:31,241
but this case
is quite exceptional.

240
00:30:52,165 --> 00:30:55,692
I quite appreciate your problem,
Mr. Treves.

241
00:30:55,769 --> 00:31:00,172
Why not contact the British Home or
the Royal Hospital for Incurables?

242
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,174
They might find a place for him.

243
00:31:02,242 --> 00:31:04,836
I'll look into it.
Would you like to meet him?

244
00:31:22,195 --> 00:31:24,129
Excuse me.

245
00:31:24,864 --> 00:31:26,354
The Elephant Man.

246
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,472
Sorry.

247
00:31:41,348 --> 00:31:44,215
I should have warned you.

248
00:31:44,284 --> 00:31:46,218
Please forgive me.

249
00:31:47,053 --> 00:31:49,419
- You all right?
- Yes, sir.

250
00:31:50,857 --> 00:31:53,826
Please ask Mrs. Mothershead
to come up here.

251
00:31:53,893 --> 00:31:57,294
Tell her to knock on the door
and wait for me.

252
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:11,510
I'm sorry about that. L...

253
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,840
We'll bring you another breakfast.
You must be very hungry.

254
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:21,319
And I think you'll be quite
comfortable here for a while.

255
00:32:21,388 --> 00:32:23,413
I'll see to it that you have
everything you need.

256
00:35:45,592 --> 00:35:46,820
Cor blimey!

257
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:55,931
So, this is the Elephant Man.

258
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,994
I ain't seen nothing
like you before.

259
00:36:02,308 --> 00:36:04,902
What the bleedin' hell
happened to ya?

260
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:11,110
Dumb, eh?

261
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:15,617
I like people
that can keep quiet.

262
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:21,823
Here, have a drink.

263
00:36:24,497 --> 00:36:26,829
Go on! No?

264
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:33,996
You should be more sociable, mate.

265
00:36:36,175 --> 00:36:38,405
You'll get yourself disliked.

266
00:36:43,683 --> 00:36:47,050
You and I are
gonna be good friends...

267
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,384
and I've got a lot of friends
who'd like to meet you.

268
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:51,548
And they will, mate.

269
00:36:51,624 --> 00:36:54,525
Believe me, they will.

270
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:09,005
I've brought your breakfast.
What are you doing down there?

271
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:11,202
Come on, up on the bed.

272
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:50,606
All he understands
is a good smack.

273
00:37:50,683 --> 00:37:54,312
He's had his share of smacks. That's
what drives him under the bed.

274
00:37:54,387 --> 00:37:57,117
You have to treat him
with kindness and patience.

275
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,853
Perhaps you've got time for that
sort of treatment, Mr. Treves.

276
00:38:00,927 --> 00:38:03,896
But I haven't.
I've got a hospital to run.

277
00:38:03,963 --> 00:38:06,124
Now, don't you waste your time
with him, sir.

278
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:11,025
It's like talking to a brick wall.

279
00:38:11,104 --> 00:38:15,473
Now, I don't mean to be harsh but...

280
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:17,509
he doesn't belong here.

281
00:38:19,412 --> 00:38:24,509
Honestly, sir, honestly,
what can you do for him?

282
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:40,593
Oh, and by the way,
Mr. Carr Gomm said...

283
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:43,635
he would like to see you
when you can spare a moment.

284
00:38:43,703 --> 00:38:45,364
- Yes.
- Right.

285
00:38:51,444 --> 00:38:53,708
I can't help you
unless you help me.

286
00:39:02,722 --> 00:39:06,419
You see, I believe there's something
that you want to say to me.

287
00:39:06,492 --> 00:39:09,188
Something back there.

288
00:39:09,262 --> 00:39:11,753
I can't help you unless
you help me, you know!

289
00:39:15,068 --> 00:39:17,969
I believe you want to say something
to me, don't you?

290
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:23,006
I've got to understand what you're
feeling, what you're thinking.

291
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,803
Do you understand me?

292
00:39:29,949 --> 00:39:33,646
All right, just nod your head
if you can... Can you understand me?

293
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:36,449
Just nod your head
if you understand me.

294
00:39:41,227 --> 00:39:42,751
All right.

295
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,962
You do understand.

296
00:39:47,033 --> 00:39:49,558
I want to hear...
I want to hear you talk.

297
00:39:49,635 --> 00:39:52,468
We're gonna show them that
you're not a wall. Understand?

298
00:39:52,538 --> 00:39:55,302
I want you to talk to me.

299
00:39:55,374 --> 00:39:59,333
All right, now,
I want to hear you say it.

300
00:39:59,412 --> 00:40:01,937
I've got to hear how
you say things.

301
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:06,451
I won't hurt you. I've got to hear
and understand how you say things.

302
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:09,920
Very slowly,
I want you to say, "Yes."

303
00:40:12,024 --> 00:40:13,286
Say, "Yes."

304
00:40:18,631 --> 00:40:20,496
Yes.

305
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:23,091
Yes!

306
00:40:23,169 --> 00:40:24,602
Good.

307
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:28,739
All right, now, just once more
say it again. "Yes."

308
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:36,207
Yes, I can understand that.

309
00:40:36,282 --> 00:40:37,749
That's good.

310
00:40:38,918 --> 00:40:40,909
That's very good.
All right now.

311
00:40:40,987 --> 00:40:43,979
I'm going to say some words to you,
and I want you to repeat them.

312
00:40:44,056 --> 00:40:46,286
Do you understand?

313
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:48,759
Say, "Hello.

314
00:40:48,828 --> 00:40:50,591
My name is..."

315
00:40:55,201 --> 00:40:56,634
Hello.

316
00:40:57,904 --> 00:41:00,668
My name is...

317
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,368
"John Merrick."

318
00:41:06,112 --> 00:41:09,343
No. John... That's very good.

319
00:41:09,415 --> 00:41:11,610
Say, "John Merrick."

320
00:41:16,088 --> 00:41:20,218
"Hello. My name is John Merrick."

321
00:41:22,395 --> 00:41:23,692
Hello.

322
00:41:23,763 --> 00:41:27,130
My name is...

323
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,828
John Merrick.

324
00:41:29,902 --> 00:41:31,233
You can speak.

325
00:41:39,912 --> 00:41:41,903
How did you get up here?

326
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:45,384
I want my man back.

327
00:41:45,451 --> 00:41:50,081
- Just a moment. How did you get up?
- Never mind that. I want my man.

328
00:41:50,156 --> 00:41:52,090
He's still very sick.

329
00:41:52,158 --> 00:41:54,558
Please, come downstairs with me,
and I'll explain the situation.

330
00:41:54,627 --> 00:41:56,254
Don't!

331
00:41:57,663 --> 00:41:59,756
Don't.

332
00:41:59,832 --> 00:42:03,859
You've had plenty of time to...

333
00:42:03,936 --> 00:42:06,097
cure him.

334
00:42:06,172 --> 00:42:08,868
And now he's leaving with me.

335
00:42:08,941 --> 00:42:14,174
Do you understand me now,
Mr. Treves?

336
00:42:14,247 --> 00:42:15,976
We made a deal.

337
00:42:16,048 --> 00:42:17,845
You misunderstood.

338
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:22,547
This man has suffered a severe fall,
if you take my meaning.

339
00:42:22,622 --> 00:42:24,419
He's my patient now.

340
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,515
Pull the other one,
why don't you?

341
00:42:26,592 --> 00:42:28,526
Mr. Bytes, I'm sorry.

342
00:42:28,594 --> 00:42:31,062
But all you do is profit
from another man's misery.

343
00:42:33,165 --> 00:42:35,156
Do you think
you're better than me?

344
00:42:35,234 --> 00:42:37,168
No, I never said that.

345
00:42:37,236 --> 00:42:40,831
You wanted the freak...

346
00:42:40,906 --> 00:42:44,364
to show to those doctor chums of
yours, to make a name for yourself.

347
00:42:44,443 --> 00:42:46,411
You, my friend.

348
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:53,077
I gave you the freak on trust...

349
00:42:53,152 --> 00:42:56,212
in the name of science...

350
00:42:56,289 --> 00:42:58,257
and now I want him back!

351
00:42:58,357 --> 00:43:00,382
You do not own this man!
Now stop it!

352
00:43:01,294 --> 00:43:03,091
I want him back!

353
00:43:03,162 --> 00:43:05,221
So you can beat him?
So you can starve him?

354
00:43:05,298 --> 00:43:07,664
A dog in the streets
would fare better with you!

355
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:09,869
I shall go to the authorities.

356
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:13,270
Go to the authorities then!
Go to them by all means.

357
00:43:13,372 --> 00:43:16,739
They'll be very interested
to hear your story as well as ours.

358
00:43:18,477 --> 00:43:20,536
Now...

359
00:43:20,613 --> 00:43:25,073
I think we really do understand
one another.

360
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,553
All right.

361
00:43:44,537 --> 00:43:47,734
Singularly unattractive character,
I must say.

362
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:53,671
Well, Treves, it seems to me I might
as well meet this patient of yours.

363
00:43:53,746 --> 00:43:57,147
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

364
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:02,146
Shall we say in a few days then?

365
00:44:02,221 --> 00:44:04,485
Shall we say 2:00
tomorrow afternoon?

366
00:44:08,127 --> 00:44:11,392
Yes. Well, whatever's
most convenient for you, sir.

367
00:44:11,464 --> 00:44:13,864
2:00 then, tomorrow.

368
00:44:13,933 --> 00:44:15,958
Thank you very much.

369
00:44:20,272 --> 00:44:21,705
2:00!

370
00:44:25,578 --> 00:44:28,012
Morning, Mr. Treves.
Early again, I see.

371
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,342
Yes.

372
00:44:29,448 --> 00:44:32,440
With these early habits of yours,
you'd have made a good milkman.

373
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:36,214
- I'll keep that in mind, Charles.
- Okay, sir. Good morning.

374
00:44:44,296 --> 00:44:47,322
He restoreth my soul.

375
00:44:47,433 --> 00:44:52,427
He leadeth me into paths of...
for His name's sake.

376
00:44:52,538 --> 00:44:55,905
Righteousness. Righteousness.

377
00:44:57,576 --> 00:45:02,172
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness...

378
00:45:02,248 --> 00:45:04,739
for His name's sake.

379
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:07,876
Good. That's very good. Good.

380
00:45:07,987 --> 00:45:12,321
When your visitor comes today, say
it exactly the way you've said it.

381
00:45:12,391 --> 00:45:17,124
So when I introduce him to you,
say the words that you've learned.

382
00:45:17,196 --> 00:45:20,962
If you have trouble with any words,
I'll help you, so don't worry.

383
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:23,501
I will introduce him to you
and say...

384
00:45:23,602 --> 00:45:26,002
"Please meet Mr. Carr Gomm."

385
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:27,663
And you will say?

386
00:45:28,841 --> 00:45:33,471
Hello. My name is John Merrick.

387
00:45:33,546 --> 00:45:35,776
I'm very pleased to meet you.

388
00:45:37,082 --> 00:45:39,550
Good! Good.

389
00:45:39,652 --> 00:45:42,587
I'll go and get Mr. Carr Gomm.

390
00:45:48,227 --> 00:45:50,855
It is only a physical problem.

391
00:45:52,498 --> 00:45:55,262
He has trouble with certain sounds
because of...

392
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:58,667
the constrictive deformity
of the mouth, but he can talk.

393
00:45:58,737 --> 00:46:02,571
Talking's one thing, but is he able
to understand what's said to him?

394
00:46:02,641 --> 00:46:05,610
Yes. Oh, yes! Except...

395
00:46:05,711 --> 00:46:09,670
Except he's so anxious to make
a good impression on you...

396
00:46:09,782 --> 00:46:11,977
that he might seem a little nervous.

397
00:46:29,835 --> 00:46:31,302
Come in.

398
00:46:45,484 --> 00:46:46,712
John...

399
00:46:46,785 --> 00:46:49,845
may I introduce you
to Mr. Carr Gomm?

400
00:46:49,955 --> 00:46:52,981
Mr. Carr Gomm,
this is John Merrick.

401
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:57,620
Hello. My name is John Merrick.

402
00:46:57,696 --> 00:46:59,664
I'm very pleased to meet you.

403
00:46:59,765 --> 00:47:01,858
I'm very pleased to meet you.

404
00:47:04,503 --> 00:47:06,437
How are you feeling today?

405
00:47:06,505 --> 00:47:09,167
I feel much better.

406
00:47:10,643 --> 00:47:12,770
Are you comfortable here?

407
00:47:15,414 --> 00:47:18,508
Everybody's been very kind.

408
00:47:19,451 --> 00:47:21,442
How is your bronchitis?

409
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:36,134
Mr. Merrick likes the food here,
don't you?

410
00:47:40,773 --> 00:47:44,265
Much better than what
I'm used to.

411
00:47:44,376 --> 00:47:46,071
Oh, yes?

412
00:47:47,012 --> 00:47:49,071
Yes. And what was that?

413
00:47:52,017 --> 00:47:53,450
Potatoes.

414
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,245
I understood
that you'd been flogged.

415
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:04,023
I feel much better now.

416
00:48:04,096 --> 00:48:05,529
That's splendid.

417
00:48:05,564 --> 00:48:08,556
How do you find Mr. Treves?

418
00:48:08,634 --> 00:48:10,795
As a teacher, I mean.

419
00:48:16,342 --> 00:48:20,938
Everybody's been very kind.

420
00:48:23,582 --> 00:48:27,916
How long did you and Mr. Treves
prepare for this interview?

421
00:48:34,693 --> 00:48:38,720
Everybody's been very kind.

422
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:40,765
Yes, of course, I understand.

423
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:43,802
Well, it's been a pleasure
meeting you, Mr. Merrick.

424
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:45,996
Good day to you.

425
00:48:55,748 --> 00:48:57,613
Very good, John.

426
00:48:57,716 --> 00:48:59,616
It was very good.

427
00:48:59,718 --> 00:49:01,618
I'll be back in a moment.

428
00:49:05,724 --> 00:49:08,557
The Lord is my shepherd...

429
00:49:09,628 --> 00:49:11,960
I shall not want.

430
00:49:13,032 --> 00:49:14,966
He maketh me lie down...

431
00:49:15,034 --> 00:49:19,528
It was a brave attempt, but the man
was mouthing words taught by you.

432
00:49:19,638 --> 00:49:23,267
Yes. Well, I'm sorry
to have wasted your time.

433
00:49:23,342 --> 00:49:26,539
He restoreth my soul.

434
00:49:26,612 --> 00:49:28,375
He simply doesn't belong here.

435
00:49:28,447 --> 00:49:31,746
He'd be better off somewhere where
he can be constantly looked after.

436
00:49:31,817 --> 00:49:34,786
I'm sorry things have turned out
this way. Good day to you.

437
00:49:34,853 --> 00:49:36,286
Yea...

438
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:41,116
though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

439
00:49:41,226 --> 00:49:43,057
I fear no evil...

440
00:49:43,128 --> 00:49:45,961
for Thou art with me.

441
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:48,499
Thy rod and staff, they...

442
00:49:48,567 --> 00:49:50,034
Mr. Carr Gomm!

443
00:49:52,538 --> 00:49:54,870
Yes, what is it?

444
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,669
It's that.

445
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:01,245
I didn't teach him that part.

446
00:50:02,948 --> 00:50:05,974
Surely goodness and mercy...

447
00:50:06,085 --> 00:50:09,350
will follow me all the days
of my life...

448
00:50:09,421 --> 00:50:14,415
and I'll dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

449
00:50:18,464 --> 00:50:21,922
How did you know the rest of it?
I didn't teach you the rest of it.

450
00:50:22,034 --> 00:50:24,002
It's very strange.

451
00:50:25,237 --> 00:50:27,705
Tell me, how did you know
the rest of it?

452
00:50:27,773 --> 00:50:30,071
The 23rd Psalm.

453
00:50:33,278 --> 00:50:37,942
I used to read the Bible every day.

454
00:50:39,718 --> 00:50:42,346
I know it very well...

455
00:50:42,421 --> 00:50:44,719
and the Book of Common Prayer.

456
00:50:46,258 --> 00:50:50,194
The 23rd Psalm is very beautiful.
It's my favorite.

457
00:50:53,031 --> 00:50:56,159
Treves, come and see me in my office
when you're through up here.

458
00:50:56,235 --> 00:50:58,169
There's something important
I want to say to you.

459
00:50:59,505 --> 00:51:03,236
Good-bye, Mr. Merrick.
I do hope we shall meet again.

460
00:51:11,283 --> 00:51:14,912
Well, why didn't you tell me
you could read?

461
00:51:17,189 --> 00:51:20,022
I was frightened.

462
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,354
I see.

463
00:51:22,427 --> 00:51:27,421
I was afraid to talk.

464
00:51:30,469 --> 00:51:33,199
Please forgive me.

465
00:51:43,115 --> 00:51:46,551
Can you imagine the kind of life
he must have had?

466
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:48,518
Yes, I think I can.

467
00:51:48,587 --> 00:51:50,521
I don't believe so.

468
00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:54,582
No one could possibly imagine it.
I don't believe any of us can!

469
00:52:05,404 --> 00:52:07,338
"Terrible though
his appearance is...

470
00:52:07,406 --> 00:52:11,502
so terrible indeed that women
and nervous persons...

471
00:52:11,577 --> 00:52:14,978
fly in horror
from the sight of him...

472
00:52:15,047 --> 00:52:20,485
and that he is debarred from seeking
to earn his livelihood in any way...

473
00:52:20,552 --> 00:52:23,350
yet he is superior in intelligence.

474
00:52:23,422 --> 00:52:27,415
He can read and write,
he's quiet, gentle...

475
00:52:27,492 --> 00:52:31,326
not to say even refined
in his mind."

476
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:42,102
I should very much like
to meet this gentleman.

477
00:53:08,834 --> 00:53:10,859
Have you seen this?

478
00:53:17,943 --> 00:53:19,376
Listen to this.

479
00:53:19,444 --> 00:53:21,469
Hey up! Hey up!

480
00:53:26,385 --> 00:53:28,046
Now listen.

481
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,749
This is a letter
to the London Times...

482
00:53:31,823 --> 00:53:33,984
from the governor of the hospital.

483
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,958
"There is now in a little room
off one of our attic wards...

484
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:40,521
a man named John Merrick.

485
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:42,760
So dreadful a sight
that he is unable...

486
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:45,962
even to come out by daylight
to the garden.

487
00:53:46,038 --> 00:53:49,030
He is being called
the Elephant Man...

488
00:53:49,107 --> 00:53:51,632
on account of
his terrible deformity.

489
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:56,647
His appearance is so terrible
that women and nervous persons...

490
00:53:56,715 --> 00:53:59,343
fly in terror
at the sight of him."

491
00:54:02,387 --> 00:54:04,912
And how do you get tickets
to see him?

492
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:07,220
Your very own Sunny Jim.

493
00:54:07,292 --> 00:54:09,920
- Let's go and see him then!
- All right, keep your shirt on.

494
00:54:09,995 --> 00:54:12,293
The time must be right.

495
00:54:13,899 --> 00:54:15,867
Right now he's in the attic.

496
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:21,338
But tomorrow they're moving him to
Bedstead Square right into my lap.

497
00:54:21,406 --> 00:54:24,864
Then, for the right price...

498
00:54:24,943 --> 00:54:30,040
you will see something you'll
never ever see again in your life!

499
00:55:19,531 --> 00:55:21,465
Well, don't look so glum, girls.

500
00:55:21,533 --> 00:55:25,367
Enthusiastic volunteers
should be more cheerful, hmm?

501
00:55:26,271 --> 00:55:28,967
Put your collar straight, girl.

502
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:31,475
And remember...

503
00:55:31,543 --> 00:55:34,535
that under no circumstances...

504
00:55:34,613 --> 00:55:36,046
whatsoever...

505
00:55:38,216 --> 00:55:40,707
are any mirrors to be brought
into this room.

506
00:55:40,786 --> 00:55:42,754
Yes, Mrs. Mothershead.

507
00:55:43,989 --> 00:55:45,820
Yes.

508
00:55:45,891 --> 00:55:47,324
All right.

509
00:55:52,664 --> 00:55:57,431
- He's so ugly.
- Ugly or not, you're gonna help me.

510
00:56:03,442 --> 00:56:06,275
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?

511
00:56:06,344 --> 00:56:07,777
Yes.

512
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,649
You look very nice
in your new clothes.

513
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:15,445
Thank you very much.

514
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,182
If there's nothing else,
I suppose we'll be leaving you now.

515
00:56:18,256 --> 00:56:20,190
No, there's nothing.

516
00:56:51,089 --> 00:56:53,057
You ready for tea?

517
00:56:54,826 --> 00:56:56,851
Please go in, John.

518
00:57:04,269 --> 00:57:05,861
Make yourself comfortable.

519
00:57:18,316 --> 00:57:20,341
Come along, meet our guest.

520
00:57:29,794 --> 00:57:32,558
Mr. Merrick, I'd like you
to meet my wife, Anne.

521
00:57:32,631 --> 00:57:35,623
Anne, this is John Merrick.

522
00:57:39,604 --> 00:57:41,731
I'm very pleased to meet you,
Mr. Merrick.

523
00:57:46,111 --> 00:57:48,102
I'm...

524
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:51,377
I'm very pleased...

525
00:57:57,556 --> 00:57:59,990
What is it?
What's the matter?

526
00:58:01,993 --> 00:58:04,587
It's just that l...

527
00:58:05,697 --> 00:58:09,724
I'm not used to being...

528
00:58:09,801 --> 00:58:14,261
treated so well by...

529
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:16,398
a beautiful woman.

530
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:21,779
Would you like a cup of tea,
Mr. Merrick?

531
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,781
That's a good idea.

532
00:58:26,418 --> 00:58:30,821
Would you like to come and see the
rest of the house? I'll show you.

533
00:58:42,367 --> 00:58:44,301
How's your tea?

534
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:49,666
It's very good!

535
00:58:53,011 --> 00:58:57,243
I'm enjoying my visit here
very much.

536
00:58:57,315 --> 00:59:01,775
It's so kind of you to invite me
into your own home.

537
00:59:04,956 --> 00:59:08,448
I'm sorry that I...

538
00:59:08,526 --> 00:59:11,222
made a spectacle of myself.

539
00:59:11,296 --> 00:59:13,423
No, not at all.

540
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:21,569
I like the way...

541
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,242
you arranged your pictures
on the mantelpiece.

542
00:59:24,242 --> 00:59:25,709
Oh, thank you.

543
00:59:25,777 --> 00:59:29,474
Is that the way they do it
in most houses?

544
00:59:29,547 --> 00:59:32,539
Yes, I'm sure they do, yes.

545
00:59:32,617 --> 00:59:34,551
Who are they of?

546
00:59:35,487 --> 00:59:39,890
These are relatives,
and these are our children.

547
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:42,449
Children?
Oh, may I see?

548
00:59:42,527 --> 00:59:44,119
Yes, of course.

549
00:59:51,803 --> 00:59:54,237
Where are the children?

550
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,500
Well, um, well,
they're out with friends...

551
00:59:58,576 --> 01:00:00,237
at the moment.

552
01:00:00,278 --> 01:00:02,940
Friends.

553
01:00:03,014 --> 01:00:06,245
And here is Frederick's mother.

554
01:00:08,787 --> 01:00:11,017
Oh, how lovely.

555
01:00:11,089 --> 01:00:15,025
And these are my parents.

556
01:00:20,965 --> 01:00:23,559
They have such...

557
01:00:23,635 --> 01:00:26,627
noble faces.

558
01:00:26,705 --> 01:00:29,833
Yes, I've always...
I've always thought so myself.

559
01:00:31,509 --> 01:00:32,942
Would you...

560
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,839
Would you care to see my mother?

561
01:00:39,217 --> 01:00:40,650
Your mother?

562
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,049
Yes, please.

563
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:53,922
Oh, she's...

564
01:00:55,633 --> 01:00:57,658
Mr. Merrick, she's beautiful.

565
01:00:57,736 --> 01:01:00,034
Oh, she had...

566
01:01:00,105 --> 01:01:02,869
She had the face of an angel.

567
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,042
I must've...

568
01:01:17,889 --> 01:01:21,450
been a great disappointment to her.

569
01:01:21,526 --> 01:01:23,118
No, Mr. Merrick.

570
01:01:24,763 --> 01:01:27,493
No son as loving as you
could ever be a disappointment.

571
01:01:29,801 --> 01:01:33,362
If only I could find her...

572
01:01:33,471 --> 01:01:35,905
so she could see me...

573
01:01:35,974 --> 01:01:40,308
with such lovely friends here now.

574
01:01:40,378 --> 01:01:42,369
Perhaps she could...

575
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,380
Iove me as I am.

576
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:49,084
I've tried so hard to be good.

577
01:01:57,262 --> 01:01:58,627
I'm so sorry.

578
01:02:00,598 --> 01:02:01,690
Please.

579
01:02:01,766 --> 01:02:03,757
I'm so sorry.

580
01:02:05,236 --> 01:02:07,067
Please. Here.

581
01:02:45,844 --> 01:02:47,778
What's that you're doing?

582
01:02:51,015 --> 01:02:52,607
What is it?

583
01:02:55,722 --> 01:02:58,816
I see.
It's St. Phillips.

584
01:02:58,892 --> 01:03:01,122
Why, that's very good.

585
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,890
I mean, you got the windows
and arches just right.

586
01:03:18,912 --> 01:03:20,504
I wish...

587
01:03:22,683 --> 01:03:24,617
I could sleep...

588
01:03:26,186 --> 01:03:27,915
like normal people.

589
01:03:35,495 --> 01:03:39,090
- Mr. Treves?
- Yes?

590
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:41,657
There's something that...

591
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,862
I've been meaning to ask you...

592
01:03:43,937 --> 01:03:46,030
for some time now.

593
01:03:46,106 --> 01:03:47,437
What's that?

594
01:03:49,142 --> 01:03:50,575
Can you cure me?

595
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:57,281
No, we can care for you...

596
01:03:57,351 --> 01:04:00,377
but we can't cure you.

597
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:06,550
I thought not.

598
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:19,305
Come in.

599
01:04:21,074 --> 01:04:25,033
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

600
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:28,275
There's someone here who'd like
to meet you, if that's all right.

601
01:04:28,348 --> 01:04:30,908
May I introduce you
to one of the bright lights...

602
01:04:30,984 --> 01:04:33,214
of the English stage,
Mrs. Kendal.

603
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:37,052
- Mrs. Kendal, Mr. John Merrick.
- Good day, Mr. Merrick.

604
01:04:39,259 --> 01:04:40,851
Good day.

605
01:04:40,927 --> 01:04:43,521
I've brought you some things.
I hope you like them.

606
01:04:43,597 --> 01:04:45,531
I hope you don't
think it too forward.

607
01:04:50,437 --> 01:04:52,962
I knew you'd understand.

608
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,974
I'll leave you together.

609
01:04:56,943 --> 01:04:58,535
Here.

610
01:05:00,914 --> 01:05:05,180
I want you to know, I don't go about
giving my picture to just anyone.

611
01:05:05,252 --> 01:05:07,186
Oh, no.
I wouldn't think of it.

612
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:11,351
It's beautiful.

613
01:05:11,425 --> 01:05:13,791
You're so...

614
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:16,556
I'll... Well, I'll...

615
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:22,666
I shall put it in a...
in a place of honor.

616
01:05:24,371 --> 01:05:27,534
Here, next to my mother.

617
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:35,674
She's very pretty, your mother.

618
01:05:35,749 --> 01:05:37,307
Oh, yes.

619
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:54,667
I see you're constructing a...

620
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,328
church?

621
01:05:57,771 --> 01:06:01,502
Oh, no.
It's a cathedral.

622
01:06:01,575 --> 01:06:03,907
You see?

623
01:06:03,977 --> 01:06:07,845
Only, I have to rely...

624
01:06:07,914 --> 01:06:09,506
on my imagination...

625
01:06:09,583 --> 01:06:12,313
for what I can't actually see.

626
01:06:23,864 --> 01:06:29,169
Mr. Treves tells me
that you're in the theater.

627
01:06:29,169 --> 01:06:31,262
Do you live there?

628
01:06:31,338 --> 01:06:34,136
Oh, no, Mr. Merrick.
I just work there.

629
01:06:35,442 --> 01:06:37,876
Well, it must be...

630
01:06:37,944 --> 01:06:40,811
wonderful just to work there.

631
01:06:40,881 --> 01:06:44,078
- Is it beautiful?
- You've never been?

632
01:06:44,151 --> 01:06:46,745
I'm afraid not.

633
01:06:47,487 --> 01:06:49,455
Oh, Mr. Merrick.
You must go.

634
01:06:49,523 --> 01:06:51,753
The theater's the most
beautiful place on earth.

635
01:06:51,825 --> 01:06:53,816
Of course, I am a bit partial.

636
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:59,191
The theater is romance.

637
01:07:00,567 --> 01:07:02,159
Romance.

638
01:07:07,207 --> 01:07:09,675
Which reminds me,
I've brought you something else.

639
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:18,550
- Thank you.
- Have you read it?

640
01:07:19,686 --> 01:07:24,555
No, but I certainly shall.

641
01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:35,534
Romeo and Juliet.

642
01:07:35,602 --> 01:07:37,934
Yes, I've heard of this.

643
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:46,505
"If I profane
with my unworthiest hand...

644
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:49,014
this holy shrine...

645
01:07:49,082 --> 01:07:52,483
the gentle fine is this...

646
01:07:52,552 --> 01:07:55,214
My lips...

647
01:07:55,288 --> 01:07:57,882
two blushing pilgrims...

648
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:01,826
ready stand to smooth
that rough touch...

649
01:08:05,131 --> 01:08:07,065
with a tender kiss."

650
01:08:08,268 --> 01:08:12,204
"Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much...

651
01:08:12,272 --> 01:08:14,604
which mannerly devotion
shows in this.

652
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:18,838
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch...

653
01:08:18,912 --> 01:08:21,210
and palm to palm
is holy Palmer's kiss."

654
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:26,314
"O, then dear saint...

655
01:08:26,386 --> 01:08:29,355
let lips do what hands do.

656
01:08:29,422 --> 01:08:32,186
They pray, grant thou...

657
01:08:32,259 --> 01:08:36,457
lest faith turn to despair."

658
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,463
"Saints do not move...

659
01:08:39,933 --> 01:08:41,924
though grant for prayer's sake."

660
01:08:43,136 --> 01:08:45,934
"Then move not...

661
01:08:46,006 --> 01:08:49,635
while my prayer's effect I take.

662
01:08:50,944 --> 01:08:52,878
Thus from my lips...

663
01:08:52,946 --> 01:08:56,575
by thine, my sin is purged."

664
01:09:01,187 --> 01:09:03,781
Oh, yes.
And then it says they kiss.

665
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:10,129
"Then have my lips
the sin that they have took."

666
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:19,463
"Sin from thy lips?

667
01:09:19,539 --> 01:09:22,269
O trespass sweetly urged.

668
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,640
Give me my sin again."

669
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:34,744
Oh, Mr. Merrick.

670
01:09:34,821 --> 01:09:36,948
You're not an elephant man at all.

671
01:09:43,330 --> 01:09:45,662
You're Romeo.

672
01:09:53,406 --> 01:09:56,898
"Mrs. Kendal, always at the
forefront of fashion and form...

673
01:09:56,977 --> 01:09:59,639
was seen leaving the London
the other afternoon.

674
01:09:59,713 --> 01:10:02,341
No, dear readers, the most
facile actress of our day...

675
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:06,681
has not been taken ill, but rather
said she was visiting a friend.

676
01:10:06,753 --> 01:10:09,950
And who was the lucky recipient
of this attention?

677
01:10:10,023 --> 01:10:13,151
Quick inquiries proved it to be
none other than Mr. John Merrick...

678
01:10:13,226 --> 01:10:17,925
the Elephant Man, with whom our
readers are undoubtedly familiar.

679
01:10:17,998 --> 01:10:20,330
After a chat of
three quarters of an hour...

680
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,630
Mrs. Kendal was kind enough
to leave Mr. Merrick...

681
01:10:22,702 --> 01:10:24,829
with an autographed portrait
of herself."

682
01:10:24,904 --> 01:10:26,838
I saw it in his room.

683
01:10:26,906 --> 01:10:30,535
"Owing to a disfigurement
of the most extreme nature...

684
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:34,774
Mr. Merrick has never been properly
presented to London society.

685
01:10:34,848 --> 01:10:36,975
But knowing that
wherever Mrs. Kendal goes...

686
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:41,282
others inevitably follow,
the question arises...

687
01:10:41,354 --> 01:10:44,380
'Will London society
present itself to him?"'

688
01:10:44,457 --> 01:10:49,019
This walking stick is so...
is so dashing.

689
01:10:49,095 --> 01:10:52,496
Much more elegant than my old one.

690
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,259
More tea?

691
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:07,112
You see, I don't go out
as often as I would like...

692
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,410
because naturally...

693
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:12,645
some people do find
my appearance disturbing.

694
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,280
If you have a chill,
I could close the window.

695
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:19,189
No, I'm fine.
Please...

696
01:11:19,259 --> 01:11:21,921
I mean, thank you.

697
01:11:21,995 --> 01:11:23,587
Thank you.

698
01:11:24,931 --> 01:11:26,523
You see...

699
01:11:27,834 --> 01:11:30,200
people are frightened...

700
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:32,465
by what they don't understand.

701
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:37,667
And it is hard to understand
even for me...

702
01:11:37,744 --> 01:11:40,212
because, well, my mother...

703
01:11:41,581 --> 01:11:44,175
she was so very beautiful.

704
01:11:54,527 --> 01:11:57,462
Mrs. Mothershead, I don't think he
should have any more visitors today.

705
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:59,760
I have to lecture at the college,
so I'll be back this evening.

706
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:01,034
Excuse me, but if you have the time,
I would like a word with you.

707
01:12:01,034 --> 01:12:03,059
Excuse me, but if you have the time,
I would like a word with you.

708
01:12:03,169 --> 01:12:06,332
- I'm awfully late. What is it?
- Well, sir, I don't quite...

709
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:08,465
I don't quite understand...

710
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:11,942
why it is you allow
that sort of people in there.

711
01:12:12,011 --> 01:12:14,809
Why? Because he enjoys it,
and I think it's very good for him.

712
01:12:14,881 --> 01:12:17,475
Yes, but sir, you saw
the expression on their faces.

713
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:19,711
They didn't hide their disgust.

714
01:12:19,786 --> 01:12:21,515
They don't care
anything about John.

715
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:23,886
They only want
to impress their friends.

716
01:12:23,957 --> 01:12:25,891
I think you're being
rather harsh on them, don't you?

717
01:12:25,959 --> 01:12:28,018
I beg your pardon, sir.

718
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,062
You yourself hardly showed him
much loving kindness...

719
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:32,098
when he first arrived, did you?

720
01:12:32,165 --> 01:12:35,999
I bathed him, I fed him and
I cleaned up after him, didn't I?

721
01:12:36,069 --> 01:12:38,629
And I see that
my nurses do the same.

722
01:12:38,705 --> 01:12:43,142
And if"loving kindness"
can be called care...

723
01:12:43,209 --> 01:12:46,042
and practical concern...

724
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:49,411
then I did show him loving kindness
and I am not ashamed to admit it.

725
01:12:49,482 --> 01:12:52,679
I didn't mean it exactly that way.
Now, please believe me.

726
01:12:52,752 --> 01:12:54,686
Now, of course
I appreciate your concern.

727
01:12:54,754 --> 01:12:57,120
I appreciate everything that
you've done for Mr. Merrick.

728
01:12:57,190 --> 01:13:01,650
But I am the physician in charge
and I must do what is best for him.

729
01:13:01,728 --> 01:13:05,425
- Please, now, I'm also very late.
- If you ask my opinion...

730
01:13:05,498 --> 01:13:07,898
he's only being stared at
all over again.

731
01:13:09,102 --> 01:13:10,694
Thank you.

732
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:39,097
Night time.

733
01:16:29,769 --> 01:16:31,703
What's the matter, Freddie?

734
01:16:35,808 --> 01:16:37,742
I've been thinking about Mr. Bytes.

735
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:39,505
What on earth
made you think of him?

736
01:16:39,579 --> 01:16:44,607
Well, I'm beginning to believe that
Mr. Bytes and I are very much alike.

737
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:46,276
That's absurd.

738
01:16:49,055 --> 01:16:52,218
It seems that
I've made Mr. Merrick...

739
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:56,284
into a curiosity all over again,
doesn't it?

740
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:59,593
Only this time in a hospital
rather than a carnival.

741
01:17:01,634 --> 01:17:03,693
My name is constantly
in the papers...

742
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:06,796
I'm always being praised
to the skies.

743
01:17:06,873 --> 01:17:10,832
Patients are now expressly
asking for my services.

744
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:13,378
Of course they do,
because you're a very fine doctor.

745
01:17:13,479 --> 01:17:16,642
John Merrick is happier
and more fulfilled now...

746
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:18,240
than he's ever been
in his entire life...

747
01:17:18,317 --> 01:17:20,478
and it's completely due to you.

748
01:17:22,422 --> 01:17:26,051
What was it all for?
Why did I do it?

749
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:28,025
Freddie, what are you trying to say?

750
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:35,100
Am I a good man...

751
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:38,169
or am I a bad man?

752
01:17:43,843 --> 01:17:47,711
Steady on, Treves.
Steady on, my dear fellow.

753
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:49,714
Come sit down, won't you?

754
01:17:55,354 --> 01:17:58,721
Gentlemen, I know we usually
open these proceedings...

755
01:17:58,791 --> 01:18:00,725
by reading the minutes.

756
01:18:00,793 --> 01:18:03,318
But on this occasion,
in the interests of urgency...

757
01:18:03,396 --> 01:18:05,125
I think we should first conclude...

758
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:07,632
the matter
previously under discussion...

759
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:10,066
the case of Mr. John Merrick,
the Elephant Man.

760
01:18:10,136 --> 01:18:14,402
One moment, Mr. Chairman.
As far as I'm concerned...

761
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,603
this creature has no business
being here at all.

762
01:18:18,811 --> 01:18:20,745
l, for one,
am sick and tired...

763
01:18:20,813 --> 01:18:23,782
of this competitive freak-hunting...

764
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:26,512
by these overly ambitious
young doctors...

765
01:18:26,586 --> 01:18:28,816
trying to make names for themselves.

766
01:18:28,888 --> 01:18:32,654
To parade them about in front of the
pathological society is one thing...

767
01:18:32,725 --> 01:18:34,818
but to waste this committee's
valuable time...

768
01:18:34,894 --> 01:18:39,228
with requests for shelter for these
abominations of nature is another.

769
01:18:44,237 --> 01:18:47,138
You must be more careful.

770
01:18:47,206 --> 01:18:51,233
In the light of these facts,
our course is clear.

771
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:54,677
The question is not whether to
accept this creature as a patient.

772
01:18:54,747 --> 01:18:58,239
The question is, when will
those rooms be vacated for use...

773
01:18:58,317 --> 01:19:01,480
by better qualified,
more deserving cases?

774
01:19:01,554 --> 01:19:03,249
I move that this Elephant Man...

775
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:05,813
be removed from
the premises immediately.

776
01:19:05,892 --> 01:19:09,623
We have a sacred duty
to cure the sick...

777
01:19:09,695 --> 01:19:11,287
not care for circus animals.

778
01:19:12,732 --> 01:19:16,099
That is my last word on the subject.
Mr. Chairman, shall we vote?

779
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:19,763
I take it, Mr. Broadneck, your mind
is quite unshakable in this matter?

780
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:22,933
Mr. Chairman,
do you not have ears?

781
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:25,500
I am unalterably opposed!

782
01:19:26,279 --> 01:19:28,270
My mind is made up on this!

783
01:19:30,149 --> 01:19:32,242
You shall not sway me.

784
01:19:32,318 --> 01:19:36,152
May we now vote, Mr. Chairman,
at long last?

785
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:38,780
Yes, Broadneck.

786
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:40,792
I think the time has come.

787
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:45,024
Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness...

788
01:19:45,097 --> 01:19:48,328
Alexandra, Princess of Wales.

789
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:09,016
Good morning, gentlemen.
I hope I am not disturbing you.

790
01:20:09,088 --> 01:20:11,147
On the contrary, ma'am.
Your presence here...

791
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,919
is always greatly appreciated.

792
01:20:13,993 --> 01:20:17,019
We were just taking a vote
on Mr. Merrick.

793
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,900
Her Royal Highness has shown
the greatest interest in his fate.

794
01:20:24,971 --> 01:20:27,337
Indeed I have, sir,
as has the queen.

795
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:33,540
I have a brief communication
from Her Majesty...

796
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:36,070
which she has requested
that I read to you.

797
01:20:39,051 --> 01:20:42,020
"To the Governing Committee,
London Hospital.

798
01:20:49,662 --> 01:20:53,996
I would very much like to commend
you for the charitable face...

799
01:20:54,066 --> 01:20:56,967
you have shown Mr. John Merrick,
the Elephant Man.

800
01:20:57,036 --> 01:20:59,664
It is laudable
that you have provided...

801
01:20:59,739 --> 01:21:02,105
one of England's
most unfortunate sons...

802
01:21:02,174 --> 01:21:06,804
with a safe and tranquil harbor,
a home.

803
01:21:06,879 --> 01:21:08,779
For this immeasurable kindness...

804
01:21:08,848 --> 01:21:11,214
as well as the many
other acts of mercy...

805
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:13,217
on behalf of the poor...

806
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:17,415
of which Mr. Carr Gomm
has kept me informed...

807
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:20,391
I gratefully thank you.

808
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:22,086
Signed, Victoria."

809
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:31,568
I'm sure I can count on you
gentlemen to do the Christian thing.

810
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:35,266
Thank you very much, ma'am.
I'm sure we shall all try.

811
01:21:36,542 --> 01:21:39,170
Gentlemen, I wish to move
that Mr. John Merrick...

812
01:21:39,245 --> 01:21:41,645
be admitted to this hospital
on a permanent basis...

813
01:21:41,747 --> 01:21:44,944
provided the hospital receives
a yearly sum...

814
01:21:45,017 --> 01:21:47,747
equal to the cost of
the occupation of one bed.

815
01:21:48,454 --> 01:21:50,649
All those in favor?

816
01:22:02,301 --> 01:22:05,361
Thank you, gentlemen.
The motion is carried.

817
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,876
Yes. Come in!

818
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:20,943
Good afternoon.

819
01:22:22,588 --> 01:22:25,386
Mr. Carr Gomm has something
he wants to say to you.

820
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:27,926
Mr. Merrick,
I have very great pleasure...

821
01:22:27,993 --> 01:22:30,757
in being able
to welcome you officially...

822
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:32,559
to the London Hospital.

823
01:22:32,631 --> 01:22:35,327
This morning, the governing
committee unanimously voted...

824
01:22:35,401 --> 01:22:39,565
that you should be provided with
these rooms on a permanent basis.

825
01:22:39,638 --> 01:22:41,868
This is your home now.

826
01:22:41,941 --> 01:22:44,239
I'm so very, very glad for you.

827
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:46,642
Welcome home, lad.

828
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:52,442
This is...

829
01:22:54,487 --> 01:22:55,920
my home?

830
01:22:55,988 --> 01:22:57,148
Yes.

831
01:22:57,223 --> 01:23:02,183
Please, will you thank
the governing committee for me?

832
01:23:02,261 --> 01:23:04,195
I will do my utmost...

833
01:23:04,263 --> 01:23:07,198
to merit their kindness.

834
01:23:07,833 --> 01:23:09,926
This...

835
01:23:10,002 --> 01:23:12,163
is my home?

836
01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:15,207
Yes. This as well.

837
01:23:22,548 --> 01:23:23,879
Your dressing case.

838
01:23:33,058 --> 01:23:34,650
Oh, thank you.

839
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:43,201
Thanks, all my friends.

840
01:23:43,269 --> 01:23:45,499
Thank you.

841
01:23:45,571 --> 01:23:48,768
- You like it?
- Oh, my friends.

842
01:23:54,313 --> 01:23:56,247
Oh, my friends.

843
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:01,275
Oh, thank you.

844
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:28,412
- Who's next?
- I say.

845
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:32,283
- What, you again?
- Yeah, but...

846
01:24:32,351 --> 01:24:35,684
But these young ladies
have never seen it.

847
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,583
You're on, mate.

848
01:24:43,229 --> 01:24:46,494
Okay, that's it
for this performance.

849
01:24:46,565 --> 01:24:50,001
- Jim, can I go tonight?
- Sit down, Charlie.

850
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:53,304
There's always tomorrow.
Don't worry.

851
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:59,534
Room for one more?

852
01:24:59,612 --> 01:25:01,546
At the right price.

853
01:25:03,449 --> 01:25:04,939
There's room.

854
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:19,387
All right, all right!
Keep the noise down!

855
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:24,335
We don't want
to frighten him, do we?

856
01:25:58,837 --> 01:26:01,169
Hello. My name...

857
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:05,472
is John Merrick...

858
01:26:05,544 --> 01:26:09,776
and I'm very, very pleased...

859
01:26:09,848 --> 01:26:12,316
to meet you.

860
01:26:16,422 --> 01:26:19,050
I think you are...

861
01:26:19,124 --> 01:26:22,150
very beautiful...

862
01:26:25,731 --> 01:26:28,325
Curtain time!

863
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,961
You look beautiful, darling.
I wouldn't change a thing.

864
01:26:33,072 --> 01:26:35,336
You look like
the bleedin' Prince of Wales.

865
01:26:37,309 --> 01:26:39,243
Here, my friends...

866
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:42,508
is the Elephant Man!

867
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:49,053
I told you he was horrible.

868
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:50,713
Just horrible.

869
01:27:00,199 --> 01:27:03,293
Perhaps the ladies
would like a closer look?

870
01:27:03,369 --> 01:27:06,930
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, Jack!

871
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:12,602
There.

872
01:27:14,913 --> 01:27:18,076
He's quite a ladies' man, isn't he?

873
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:22,177
Come on. Give the ladies' man
a little kiss, eh?

874
01:27:23,489 --> 01:27:25,719
Come on.
Give him a kiss.

875
01:27:37,736 --> 01:27:40,466
Here, here, here!
That's enough romance.

876
01:27:40,539 --> 01:27:42,131
Time for beddy-byes.

877
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:34,492
All right, all right.
Keep the noise down.

878
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,120
Now, keep it quiet.
Quiet! Hey!

879
01:28:37,196 --> 01:28:39,164
Keep it quiet.
Now, watch this.

880
01:29:23,809 --> 01:29:26,437
Okay, that's enough!
That's enough!

881
01:29:26,512 --> 01:29:28,707
That's it.
The show's over.

882
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,714
I'll see you back
at the Peacock.

883
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:35,553
Get out of here.

884
01:30:02,614 --> 01:30:04,206
Here.

885
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:06,942
Come on.

886
01:30:09,855 --> 01:30:12,790
There you are.
That's better, isn't it?

887
01:30:15,527 --> 01:30:18,189
I've done well tonight.

888
01:30:18,263 --> 01:30:21,255
Here. Buy yourself a sweet.

889
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:49,993
My treasure.

890
01:32:09,141 --> 01:32:12,269
- I know what happened last night.
- What?

891
01:32:20,886 --> 01:32:23,088
Dear God.

892
01:32:23,088 --> 01:32:24,817
Boy!

893
01:32:42,107 --> 01:32:46,134
Where is he?
Where's Mr. Merrick?

894
01:32:51,583 --> 01:32:54,245
Where is he?
Where's Mr. Merrick?

895
01:32:56,388 --> 01:32:59,255
- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- Don't lie to me!

896
01:33:00,659 --> 01:33:03,924
I know all about it.
You were seen.

897
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,929
You're involved with Bytes,
aren't you?

898
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:08,864
You've taken him.
Where is he?

899
01:33:08,934 --> 01:33:11,903
Now, wait a minute.
I haven't taken him anywhere.

900
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:15,531
I don't know no Bytes.
We were just having a bit of fun.

901
01:33:15,607 --> 01:33:17,598
We never hurt him.

902
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:19,610
You know, just having a laugh,
that's all.

903
01:33:19,678 --> 01:33:22,806
You bastard! He's gone!

904
01:33:22,881 --> 01:33:25,213
When I left him,
he was in bed safe and sound!

905
01:33:25,283 --> 01:33:28,582
You bastard!
You bastard!

906
01:33:28,653 --> 01:33:32,282
You're not listening to me!
I told you, I don't know no Bytes!

907
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:34,154
I ain't done nothing wrong.

908
01:33:34,226 --> 01:33:37,957
People pay money to see
your monster. I collect it.

909
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:40,190
You're the monster!
You're the freak!

910
01:33:40,265 --> 01:33:42,358
Now, get out!
You're finished!

911
01:33:42,434 --> 01:33:45,926
You don't frighten me,
you and your bleedin' Elephant Man.

912
01:33:47,472 --> 01:33:50,669
I'm glad what I done,
and you can do nothing about it.

913
01:33:50,742 --> 01:33:52,972
Only Mothershead can sack me now!

914
01:33:58,784 --> 01:34:00,376
Done.

915
01:34:17,102 --> 01:34:19,093
There's something
I'd like to tell you, Treves.

916
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:24,072
You know, I felt as deeply
as you did about John.

917
01:34:24,142 --> 01:34:25,871
Well, now he's disappeared...

918
01:34:25,944 --> 01:34:28,174
very likely to the continent.

919
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:30,476
There's no question
of your going after him.

920
01:34:30,549 --> 01:34:33,541
You're desperately needed here
by your patients.

921
01:34:33,618 --> 01:34:36,451
You did everything
in your power.

922
01:34:36,521 --> 01:34:38,546
Remember that, Treves.

923
01:34:38,623 --> 01:34:40,557
Everything in your power.

924
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:11,773
Get the stool.

925
01:36:38,510 --> 01:36:40,068
Get up, you bastard.

926
01:37:05,904 --> 01:37:09,670
Look at all these
beautiful animals.

927
01:37:14,179 --> 01:37:16,647
What a lot you have.

928
01:37:28,627 --> 01:37:31,152
That sly bastard.

929
01:37:36,167 --> 01:37:39,398
He's doing this to spite me!

930
01:37:49,414 --> 01:37:51,814
You're doing this to spite me...

931
01:37:51,883 --> 01:37:53,851
and it's got to stop!

932
01:37:53,918 --> 01:37:56,386
Bytes, he's sick!

933
01:37:56,454 --> 01:37:58,388
Let him die!

934
01:38:00,492 --> 01:38:03,256
But don't think
I'm going to bury that...

935
01:38:05,697 --> 01:38:07,358
bag of flesh!

936
01:38:07,432 --> 01:38:09,024
Wrong!

937
01:38:16,141 --> 01:38:18,075
As a matter of fact...

938
01:38:24,716 --> 01:38:27,344
- Bytes, no!
- As a matter of fact...

939
01:38:27,419 --> 01:38:29,353
Bytes, stop, please!

940
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:17,791
Bytes, please, don't!

941
01:40:24,235 --> 01:40:25,827
We've decided...

942
01:40:29,073 --> 01:40:31,007
we're gonna get you out of here.

943
01:40:31,075 --> 01:40:33,202
All right?

944
01:40:59,671 --> 01:41:01,605
Good on you, mate.
Good on you.

945
01:42:21,352 --> 01:42:22,785
Luck, my friend.

946
01:42:25,456 --> 01:42:28,687
Luck. And who needs it
more than we?

947
01:43:56,414 --> 01:43:58,473
Hey, mister.

948
01:43:59,817 --> 01:44:02,911
Mister, why is your head so big?

949
01:44:07,058 --> 01:44:08,992
Why is your head so big, mister?

950
01:44:12,296 --> 01:44:15,356
Why is your head so big?
Why won't you answer me?

951
01:44:21,706 --> 01:44:23,640
Why is your head so big, mister?

952
01:44:51,936 --> 01:44:53,870
Stop him!

953
01:45:51,162 --> 01:45:54,154
I am not an animal!

954
01:45:56,033 --> 01:45:58,934
I am not an animal!

955
01:46:01,639 --> 01:46:05,268
I am a human being!

956
01:46:10,681 --> 01:46:13,479
I am...

957
01:46:13,551 --> 01:46:15,485
a man!

958
01:46:20,558 --> 01:46:22,526
Excuse me, sir.

959
01:46:22,593 --> 01:46:25,061
Out of the way, sir.
Excuse me.

960
01:46:28,065 --> 01:46:31,364
Mr. Treves, sir!
They found him!

961
01:46:31,435 --> 01:46:33,995
I think they found John!

962
01:46:45,483 --> 01:46:47,075
Thank you.

963
01:46:54,358 --> 01:46:57,088
- Keep still, girl.
- Sorry.

964
01:46:58,629 --> 01:47:02,258
That was very nice of Mrs. Kendal
to give me this dress for tonight.

965
01:47:02,333 --> 01:47:03,925
It's so beautiful.

966
01:47:07,371 --> 01:47:10,169
Does Mrs. Kendal know
that John is dying?

967
01:47:14,545 --> 01:47:16,012
Yes, she knows.

968
01:47:31,128 --> 01:47:33,596
How do I look?

969
01:47:33,664 --> 01:47:35,291
Splendid.

970
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:39,462
Now, you will not look out of place.
You look absolutely splendid.

971
01:47:39,537 --> 01:47:43,405
- Oh, splendid. Shall we go?
- Yes.

972
01:47:44,475 --> 01:47:46,033
Again...

973
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:50,137
I can't tell you how sorry I am
for what happened.

974
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:53,706
You see, I had no idea, really.

975
01:47:53,784 --> 01:47:56,548
Please, you mustn't blame yourself.

976
01:47:56,621 --> 01:48:01,217
Mr. Treves, don't worry about me...

977
01:48:01,292 --> 01:48:03,453
my friend.

978
01:48:03,527 --> 01:48:09,066
I am happy every hour of the day.

979
01:48:09,066 --> 01:48:13,662
My life is full
because I know that I am loved.

980
01:48:17,508 --> 01:48:20,306
I have gained myself.

981
01:48:28,619 --> 01:48:32,316
I could not say that...

982
01:48:32,390 --> 01:48:34,449
were it not for you.

983
01:48:38,596 --> 01:48:41,997
Well, and l...

984
01:48:42,066 --> 01:48:45,934
You've done so much for me as well.

985
01:48:46,003 --> 01:48:47,595
Thank you.

986
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,498
So...

987
01:48:52,643 --> 01:48:54,611
I'll fetch Mrs. Mothershead
and Nora...

988
01:48:54,679 --> 01:48:57,239
and be back in a few minutes.

989
01:48:59,684 --> 01:49:01,618
Very good, my friend.

990
01:49:06,223 --> 01:49:08,157
My friend.

991
01:52:04,001 --> 01:52:06,265
Mrs. Kendal.

992
01:52:09,206 --> 01:52:11,367
Thank you.

993
01:52:11,442 --> 01:52:13,376
Your Royal Highness...

994
01:52:13,444 --> 01:52:15,207
ladies and gentlemen...

995
01:52:15,279 --> 01:52:17,770
tonight's performance
was very special to me...

996
01:52:17,848 --> 01:52:20,373
because it was very special
to someone else.

997
01:52:20,451 --> 01:52:23,477
A man who knows the theater
and who loves the theater...

998
01:52:23,554 --> 01:52:26,489
and yet this is the very first time
he's ever been here.

999
01:52:28,192 --> 01:52:29,489
I wish to dedicate...

1000
01:52:29,593 --> 01:52:32,460
The whole company wishes to dedicate
with all their hearts...

1001
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:34,964
tonight's performance...

1002
01:52:35,032 --> 01:52:37,000
to Mr. John Merrick...

1003
01:52:37,067 --> 01:52:39,058
my very dear friend.

1004
01:52:51,448 --> 01:52:54,417
Stand up.
They want to see you.

1005
01:52:54,485 --> 01:52:57,283
Go on. It's all right.
Just stand up.

1006
01:52:57,354 --> 01:52:59,288
They want to see you.

1007
01:53:35,726 --> 01:53:39,662
I really did believe that...

1008
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:43,359
the ogre would never
get out of the dungeon.

1009
01:53:45,169 --> 01:53:48,661
Good.
So you really enjoyed yourself?

1010
01:53:51,442 --> 01:53:53,034
It was wonderful!

1011
01:53:53,110 --> 01:53:57,911
Good. Then we must
go again some evening.

1012
01:53:57,982 --> 01:54:01,110
Oh, yes.
Oh, I hope so.

1013
01:54:01,185 --> 01:54:03,210
Yes, we will.
We will.

1014
01:54:04,755 --> 01:54:07,121
Good. I'm pleased.

1015
01:54:07,191 --> 01:54:11,025
Well, I ought to go.

1016
01:54:11,095 --> 01:54:15,395
You must get some sleep.
Good night, and sleep well.

1017
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:21,401
- And you too, my friend.
- Yes.

1018
01:54:21,472 --> 01:54:23,940
I'm so pleased
you enjoyed yourself.

1019
01:54:24,008 --> 01:54:26,135
Good night.

1020
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:31,172
Good night.

1021
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:05,098
It's finished.

1022
01:59:36,553 --> 01:59:40,887
Never, oh, never
nothing will die.

1023
01:59:40,924 --> 01:59:45,258
The stream flows,
the wind blows.

1024
01:59:45,329 --> 01:59:49,265
The cloud fleets,
the heart beats.

1025
02:00:10,687 --> 02:00:12,848
Nothing will die.
