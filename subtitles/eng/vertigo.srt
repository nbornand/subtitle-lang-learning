1
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,135
Give me your hand!

2
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,741
Give me your hand.

3
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:57,539
- I thought you said no more aches or pains.
- It's this darned corset. It binds.

4
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,976
No three-way stretch? How very un-chic.

5
00:05:01,477 --> 00:05:05,180
You know the police department doctors.
No sense of style.

6
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:08,350
Anyway, tomorrow will be the day.

7
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:10,085
What's tomorrow?

8
00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:12,588
Tomorrow?
The corset comes off tomorrow.

9
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:15,624
I'll be able to scratch myself
like anybody else tomorrow.

10
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:20,329
I'll throw this miserable thing
out the window. I'll be a free man.

11
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,099
Midge, do you suppose
many men wear corsets?

12
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,368
- More than you think.
- Really?

13
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:29,238
Do you know that
from personal experience or...

14
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:30,606
Please.

15
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:34,576
- What happens after tomorrow?
- What do you mean?

16
00:05:34,743 --> 00:05:38,413
What are you going to do
once you've quit the police force?

17
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:42,784
- You sound so disapproving, Midge.
- No. It's your life.

18
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:45,254
You were the bright, young lawyer
who decided...

19
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:47,823
...he was going to be
chief of police someday.

20
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:50,292
- I had to quit.
- Why?

21
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:54,062
Because of this fear of heights I have,
this acrophobia.

22
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,798
I wake up at night seeing that man fall
from the roof...

23
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:59,268
...and I try to reach out to him and...

24
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,905
- It wasn't your fault.
- That's what everybody tells me.

25
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,842
- Johnny, the doctors explained to you--
- I know, I know.

26
00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:10,712
I have acrophobia,
which gives me vertigo, and I get dizzy.

27
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:13,982
What a moment to find out I had it.

28
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:18,453
You've got it, and there's no losing it.
And there's no one to blame. So why quit?

29
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:21,123
You mean, and sit behind a desk,
chair-borne?

30
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:25,027
- Where you belong.
- What about my acrophobia?

31
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:28,263
Suppose I'm sitting in this chair,
behind a desk.

32
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:30,832
A pencil falls from the desk
down to the floor...

33
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:34,169
...and I reach down to pick it up,
bingo, my acrophobia's back.

34
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:38,573
What'll you do?

35
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:41,676
I'm not gonna do anything for a while.

36
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,747
Don't forget, I'm a man
of independent means, as the saying goes.

37
00:06:45,814 --> 00:06:47,182
Fairly independent.

38
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,552
Why don't you go away for a while?

39
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:54,055
You mean, to forget?
Midge, don't be so motherly.

40
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,259
I'm not gonna crack up.

41
00:06:57,359 --> 00:07:01,029
- Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
- I'm having one right now.

42
00:07:02,264 --> 00:07:05,033
Midge, the music.
Don't you think it's sort of...

43
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,172
What's this doohickey?

44
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,842
It's a brassiere.

45
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,912
You know about those things.
You're a big boy now.

46
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,114
I've never run across one like that.

47
00:07:19,514 --> 00:07:22,050
It's brand-new. Revolutionary uplift.

48
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:27,222
No shoulder straps, no back straps,
but does everything a brassiere should do.

49
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:29,991
Works on the principle
of the cantilever bridge.

50
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:31,493
It does?

51
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,763
An aircraft engineer
down the peninsula designed it.

52
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:37,198
He worked it out in his spare time.

53
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,833
Kind of a hobby.

54
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:42,871
A do-it-yourself type of thing.

55
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,875
How's your love life, Midge?

56
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:50,045
That's following a train of thought.

57
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:51,279
Well?

58
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,481
Normal.

59
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,951
Aren't you ever gonna get married?

60
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,887
You know there's only one man
in the world for me, Johnny-O.

61
00:07:58,953 --> 00:08:02,090
You mean me.
We were engaged once, weren't we?

62
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,428
- Three whole weeks.
- Good old college days.

63
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:11,132
But you were the one that called off
the engagement, you remember?

64
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:14,135
I'm still available. Available Ferguson.

65
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:18,773
Midge, do you remember a fellow
in college by the name of Gavin Elster?

66
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:21,476
- Gavin Elster?
- Yes, funny name.

67
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,778
You'd think I would? No.

68
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,184
I got a call from Gavin today.
He dropped out of sight during the war.

69
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,986
Somebody said he went East.
I guess he's back.

70
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,356
- It's a Mission number.
- That's Skid Row, isn't it?

71
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,991
Could be.

72
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:40,728
He's probably on the bum and wants
to touch you for the price of a drink.

73
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:44,866
Well, I'm on the bum. I'll buy him
a couple drinks and tell him my troubles.

74
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:48,036
Not tonight. How about you and me
going out for a beer?

75
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:49,737
Sorry, old man. Work.

76
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:51,806
Then, I think I'll go home.

77
00:08:55,276 --> 00:08:58,146
Midge, what'd you mean,
there's no losing it?

78
00:08:58,546 --> 00:08:59,581
What?

79
00:09:00,615 --> 00:09:02,083
The acrophobia.

80
00:09:02,884 --> 00:09:04,419
I asked my doctor.

81
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:08,823
He said that only another emotional shock
could do it and probably wouldn't.

82
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:11,759
You're not gonna go diving off
another rooftop to find out?

83
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:14,095
- I think I can lick it.
- How?

84
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,763
I have a theory.

85
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:20,134
I think if I can get used to heights
just a little bit at a time...

86
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:23,805
...just a little, like that,
progressively, you see?

87
00:09:23,838 --> 00:09:26,174
I'll show you what I mean. Here.

88
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,177
I'll show you what I mean.

89
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:32,246
- We'll start with this.
- That?

90
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:35,183
What do you want me to start with,
the Golden Gate Bridge?

91
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,118
Watch this. Here we go.

92
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:39,454
There.

93
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:44,592
Now, I look up, I look down.

94
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:49,831
- You're kidding. Wait a minute.
- There's nothing to it.

95
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:52,867
- Here.
- That's a girl.

96
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:55,937
I'll use that. Put it right there.

97
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:00,374
All right, here's the first step.

98
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:04,612
Okay, now step number two.

99
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,448
Step number two coming up.

100
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:12,019
There we are.

101
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,189
See? I look up, I look down, I look up...

102
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,226
I'm going right out to buy myself
a nice tall stepladder.

103
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:21,162
- Take it easy now.
- All right, now here we go.

104
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:23,064
No problem.

105
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:31,973
Why, this is a cinch.
I look up, I look down.

106
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,709
I look up, I look down.

107
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,406
How did you get in
the shipbuilding business, Gavin?

108
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:07,642
I married into it.

109
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:11,212
Very interesting business.

110
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:13,581
To be honest, I find it dull.

111
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:15,816
You don't have to do it for a living.

112
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,352
No, but one assumes responsibilities.

113
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:20,921
My wife's family is all gone.

114
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:23,591
Someone has to look after her interests.

115
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,294
Her father's partner runs the company yard
in the East. Baltimore.

116
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:32,199
So I decided, as long as I had to work at it,
I'd come back here.

117
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:36,470
- I've always liked it here.
- How long have you been back?

118
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:37,972
Almost a year.

119
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:39,340
You like it?

120
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:41,709
San Francisco's changed.

121
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:46,380
The things that spell San Francisco
to me are disappearing fast.

122
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,851
Like all these.

123
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:53,320
I should have liked to have lived here then.

124
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:55,956
Color, excitement, power.

125
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:57,491
Freedom.

126
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:01,128
Shouldn't you be sitting down?

127
00:12:01,228 --> 00:12:02,796
No, I'm all right.

128
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:08,135
I was sorry to read about that thing
in the paper. And you've quit the force.

129
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:11,872
- Is it a permanent physical disability?
- No, no.

130
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:16,310
It just means I can't climb stairs
that are too steep or go to high places...

131
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:18,779
...like the bar at the Top of the Mark.

132
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:21,415
There are plenty of street-level bars
in this town.

133
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:23,284
Would you like a drink now?

134
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:25,419
No, I don't think so.

135
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:27,821
It's a little early in the day for me.

136
00:12:30,424 --> 00:12:33,360
I guess that covers everything, doesn't it?

137
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:37,097
I never married,
I don't see much of the old college gang.

138
00:12:37,164 --> 00:12:40,701
I'm a retired detective
and you're in the shipbuilding business.

139
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,405
What's on your mind, Gavin?

140
00:12:44,872 --> 00:12:49,143
I asked you to come up here, Scottie,
knowing that you'd quit detective work...

141
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,714
...but I wondered whether you'd go back
on the job as a special favor to me.

142
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:55,983
I want you to follow my wife.

143
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,886
No, it's not that.
We're very happily married.

144
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:02,256
- Well, then...
- I'm afraid some harm may come to her.

145
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:04,858
- From whom?
- Someone dead.

146
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:12,166
Scottie, do you believe
that someone out of the past...

147
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:17,171
...someone dead, can enter
and take possession of a living being?

148
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:18,505
No.

149
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:23,811
If I told you I believe this has happened
to my wife, what would you say?

150
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:28,081
I'd say take her to the nearest psychiatrist
or psychologist...

151
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:32,085
...or neurologist or...
Or maybe just the plain family doctor.

152
00:13:32,553 --> 00:13:34,721
I'd have him check on you, too.

153
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:38,992
Then you're of no use to me.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

154
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:41,562
Thanks for coming in, Scottie.

155
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,030
Okay.

156
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:47,100
I didn't mean to be that rough.

157
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:49,703
No, it sounds idiotic, I know.

158
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,106
And you're still the hardheaded Scot,
aren't you?

159
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,243
Always were.
Do you think I'm making it up?

160
00:13:57,377 --> 00:13:58,345
No.

161
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:01,815
I'm not making it up.
I wouldn't know how.

162
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,619
She'll be talking to me about something.

163
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,221
Suddenly the words fade into silence.

164
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:12,059
A cloud comes into her eyes
and they go blank.

165
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:16,930
She's somewhere else, away from me,
someone I don't know.

166
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:20,167
I call to her, she doesn't even hear me.

167
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:23,403
Then, with a long sigh, she's back.

168
00:14:24,137 --> 00:14:27,441
Looks at me brightly.
Doesn't even know she's been away.

169
00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:29,543
Can't tell me where or when.

170
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:33,580
How often does this happen?

171
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,816
More and more in the past few weeks.

172
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:38,785
And she wanders.
God knows where she wanders.

173
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:42,189
I followed her one day...

174
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:45,892
...watched her coming out
of the apartment, someone I didn't know.

175
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:48,628
She even walked a different way.

176
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:51,164
Got into her car and...

177
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:54,367
...drove out to Golden Gate Park,
five miles.

178
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:57,237
Sat by the lake...

179
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,707
...staring across the water at the pillars
that stand on the far shore.

180
00:15:00,807 --> 00:15:02,976
You know, Portals of the Past.

181
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:05,979
Sat there a long time without moving.

182
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:08,849
I had to leave, get back to the office.

183
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:12,352
When I got home that evening,
I asked her what she'd done all day.

184
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:14,521
She said she'd driven
to Golden Gate Park...

185
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:16,623
...and sat by the lake, that's all.

186
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:19,526
Well?

187
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,130
The speedometer on her car showed
that she'd driven 94 miles.

188
00:15:24,864 --> 00:15:26,433
Where did she go?

189
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:30,537
I've got to know where she goes
and what she does...

190
00:15:30,604 --> 00:15:32,305
...before I get involved with doctors.

191
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:35,875
- Have you discussed this with the doctors?
- Yes, but carefully.

192
00:15:36,242 --> 00:15:40,013
I want to know more
before committing her to that kind of care.

193
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:43,350
I'll get you a firm of private eyes
to follow her for you.

194
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:46,152
- They're dependable, good boys.
- I want you.

195
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:48,588
Look, this isn't my line.

196
00:15:49,255 --> 00:15:51,658
Scottie, I need a friend,
someone I can trust.

197
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:53,693
I'm in a panic about this.

198
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:57,697
I'm supposed to be retired. I don't want
to get mixed up in this darn thing.

199
00:15:57,864 --> 00:16:00,734
Look, we're going to an opening
at the opera tonight.

200
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,037
We're dining at Ernie's first.
You can see her there.

201
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:07,574
Ernie's.

202
00:26:08,172 --> 00:26:11,242
Say, will you tell me something?
That lady sitting there.

203
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:13,678
Who's the woman in the painting?

204
00:26:13,844 --> 00:26:18,215
<i>That's Carlotta. You'll find it</i>
<i>in the catalogue. Portrait of Carlotta.</i>

205
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:20,318
- May I have this?
- Yes.

206
00:28:13,197 --> 00:28:14,131
Yes?

207
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,438
Is there something I can do for you?

208
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:23,841
- Yes. You run this hotel?
- Yes.

209
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:26,877
Would you tell me who has the room
on the second floor...

210
00:28:26,977 --> 00:28:28,812
...in the corner, that corner?

211
00:28:29,246 --> 00:28:32,683
I'm afraid we couldn't give out information
of that sort.

212
00:28:32,783 --> 00:28:35,886
Our clients are entitled to their privacy,
you know.

213
00:28:35,953 --> 00:28:38,522
And I do believe it's against the law.

214
00:28:39,256 --> 00:28:42,993
Of course, I don't think any of them
would mind really, but still I--

215
00:28:44,495 --> 00:28:46,663
Has she done something wrong?

216
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:48,899
Please answer my question.

217
00:28:49,032 --> 00:28:52,236
- I can't imagine that sweet girl--
- What's her name?

218
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:56,373
- Miss Valds. Spanish, you know.
- Carlotta Valds?

219
00:28:56,673 --> 00:28:58,075
Yeah, that's it.

220
00:28:58,175 --> 00:29:00,577
Sweet name, isn't it? Foreign, but sweet.

221
00:29:00,677 --> 00:29:02,146
How long has she had the room?

222
00:29:02,246 --> 00:29:05,315
It must be two weeks.
Her rent's due tomorrow.

223
00:29:05,816 --> 00:29:07,584
Does she sleep here ever?

224
00:29:07,684 --> 00:29:10,787
No, she just comes to sit
two or three times a week.

225
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:15,158
I don't ask questions, you know,
as long as they're well-behaved.

226
00:29:16,093 --> 00:29:18,328
When she comes down,
don't say I've been here.

227
00:29:18,428 --> 00:29:20,631
But she hasn't been here today.

228
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:23,100
I just saw her come in five minutes ago.

229
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:26,837
No, she hasn't been here at all.
I would have seen her.

230
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:31,275
I've been right here all the time,
putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves.

231
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:34,144
And there.

232
00:29:34,177 --> 00:29:37,281
You see? Her key is on the rack.

233
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:40,550
- Would you please go up and look?
- To her room?

234
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:43,287
- That's right.
- Yes, of course, if you ask.

235
00:29:44,755 --> 00:29:47,190
- But it does seem silly.
- Thank you.

236
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:05,942
Mr.Detective?

237
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:11,415
Would you like to come and look?

238
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:42,000
- Her car's gone.
- What car?

239
00:31:11,074 --> 00:31:12,208
Midge...

240
00:31:12,943 --> 00:31:16,513
...who do you know that's an authority
on San Francisco history?

241
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,015
That's the kind of greeting a girl likes.

242
00:31:19,115 --> 00:31:21,384
None of this:
"Hello, you look wonderful" stuff.

243
00:31:21,484 --> 00:31:23,887
Just, "Do you know an authority
on San Francisco--"

244
00:31:23,987 --> 00:31:26,056
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

245
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:28,825
Well, who do you? You know everybody.

246
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:31,628
Professor Saunders over in Berkeley.

247
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:33,630
No, I don't mean that kind of history.

248
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:37,500
I mean the small stuff,
people you never heard of.

249
00:31:39,502 --> 00:31:43,006
You mean the gay old bohemian days
of gay old San Francisco.

250
00:31:43,406 --> 00:31:46,376
Juicy stories, like who shot who
in the Embarcadero...

251
00:31:46,443 --> 00:31:48,912
- ...in August, 1879.
- Yeah, that's right.

252
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:50,747
- Pop Leibel.
- Who?

253
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,716
Pop Leibel.
He owns the Argosy Book Shop.

254
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:55,685
What do you want to know?

255
00:31:55,752 --> 00:31:59,622
I want to know who shot who
in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.

256
00:32:01,057 --> 00:32:04,194
Wait a minute. You're not
a detective anymore. What's going on?

257
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,329
- You know him well?
- Who?

258
00:32:06,596 --> 00:32:08,331
- Pop Leibel.
- Sure.

259
00:32:08,865 --> 00:32:11,134
Come on. I want you to introduce me.

260
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:13,870
- Get your hat.
- I don't need a hat.

261
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:18,408
Johnny, what's it all about?

262
00:32:22,612 --> 00:32:24,080
Wait a minute.

263
00:32:31,154 --> 00:32:32,822
Yes, I remember.

264
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,891
Carlotta.

265
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,427
The beautiful Carlotta.

266
00:32:38,361 --> 00:32:39,896
The sad Carlotta.

267
00:32:40,263 --> 00:32:43,232
What does an old house
on the corner of Eddy and Gough...

268
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:45,034
...have to do with Carlotta Valds?

269
00:32:45,134 --> 00:32:49,339
It was hers.
It was built for her many years ago.

270
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:51,240
- By whom?
- By...

271
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:59,315
No. The name I do not remember.

272
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:02,285
A rich man. A powerful man.

273
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:04,620
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

274
00:33:04,687 --> 00:33:06,589
- Cigarette, miss?
- No, thanks.

275
00:33:07,957 --> 00:33:09,926
It is not an unusual story.

276
00:33:11,294 --> 00:33:14,697
She came from somewhere small,
to the south of the city.

277
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,935
Some say from a mission settlement.

278
00:33:19,502 --> 00:33:21,704
Young, yes. Very young.

279
00:33:23,072 --> 00:33:27,977
And she was found dancing and singing
in a cabaret by that man...

280
00:33:29,011 --> 00:33:30,580
...and he took her...

281
00:33:31,547 --> 00:33:35,418
...and built for her the great house
in the Western Addition.

282
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:38,321
And...

283
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:41,390
...there was a child.

284
00:33:41,924 --> 00:33:45,061
Yes, that's it. The child. The child.

285
00:33:46,362 --> 00:33:50,500
I cannot tell you
exactly how much time passed...

286
00:33:50,933 --> 00:33:53,236
...or how much happiness there was...

287
00:33:53,703 --> 00:33:55,771
...but then he threw her away.

288
00:33:56,706 --> 00:33:59,809
He had no other children.
His wife had no children.

289
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:04,247
So, he kept the child and threw her away.

290
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:08,651
You know, a man could do that
in those days.

291
00:34:09,018 --> 00:34:11,387
They had the power and the freedom.

292
00:34:12,622 --> 00:34:15,291
And she became the sad Carlotta.

293
00:34:16,592 --> 00:34:18,628
Alone in the great house...

294
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:21,130
...walking the streets alone...

295
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:25,534
...her clothes becoming old
and patched and dirty.

296
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,706
And, the mad Carlotta...

297
00:34:32,174 --> 00:34:34,844
...stopping people in the streets to ask:

298
00:34:35,845 --> 00:34:37,513
"Where is my child?

299
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:40,516
"Have you seen my child?"

300
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:44,086
- Poor thing.
- And she died.

301
00:34:44,954 --> 00:34:46,455
- She died.
- How?

302
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,225
By her own hand.

303
00:34:52,461 --> 00:34:54,497
There are many such stories.

304
00:34:55,131 --> 00:34:56,966
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.

305
00:34:57,066 --> 00:34:59,368
- I appreciate it. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

306
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:02,872
Wait a minute! Good-bye, Pop.
Thanks a lot.

307
00:35:10,112 --> 00:35:12,681
- Now then, Johnny-O, pay me.
- For what?

308
00:35:12,815 --> 00:35:16,619
- For bringing you here. Come on, tell.
- There's nothing to tell.

309
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,523
- You'll tell or be back in that corset.
- Come on. I'll take you home.

310
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:32,134
There we are.

311
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:34,870
- You haven't told me everything.
- I've told you enough.

312
00:35:35,004 --> 00:35:38,274
- Who's the guy and who's the wife?
- Out. I've got things to do.

313
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:41,744
I know. The one that phoned.
Your old college chum, Elster.

314
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:43,045
Midge, out, please.

315
00:35:43,078 --> 00:35:46,548
The idea is the beautiful, mad Carlotta
has returned from the dead...

316
00:35:46,582 --> 00:35:48,884
...and taken possession of Elster's wife.

317
00:35:49,718 --> 00:35:51,687
Johnny, really. Come on.

318
00:35:51,787 --> 00:35:54,857
I'm not telling you what I think,
I'm telling you what he thinks.

319
00:35:54,957 --> 00:35:57,426
- What do you think?
- Well, I...

320
00:35:58,093 --> 00:35:59,962
- Is she pretty?
- Carlotta?

321
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:02,498
Not Carlotta. Elster's wife.

322
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:08,570
Yes. I guess you'd consider
that she would be--

323
00:36:08,671 --> 00:36:11,740
I think I'll go take a look
at that portrait. Good-bye.

324
00:36:11,974 --> 00:36:14,076
- Midge...
- Good-bye!

325
00:36:43,806 --> 00:36:46,308
You've done well, Scottie.
You're good at your job.

326
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,210
- That's Carlotta Valds.
- Yes.

327
00:36:48,277 --> 00:36:50,646
There are things you didn't tell me.

328
00:36:50,979 --> 00:36:54,383
- I didn't know where she'd lead you.
- But you knew about this.

329
00:36:55,484 --> 00:36:59,221
You notice the way she does her hair?
There's something else.

330
00:37:00,055 --> 00:37:04,259
My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces
of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta.

331
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:05,961
She inherited them.

332
00:37:06,161 --> 00:37:08,664
Never wore them.
They were too old-fashioned.

333
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,098
Until now.

334
00:37:10,933 --> 00:37:14,303
Now when she's alone,
she takes them out and looks at them...

335
00:37:14,636 --> 00:37:16,972
...handles them gently, curiously...

336
00:37:18,273 --> 00:37:21,410
...puts them on and stares at herself
in the mirror...

337
00:37:21,643 --> 00:37:25,180
...and then goes into that other world,
is someone else again.

338
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:29,751
Carlotta Valds was what,
your wife's grandmother?

339
00:37:30,452 --> 00:37:31,853
Great-grandmother.

340
00:37:32,187 --> 00:37:34,356
The child who was taken from her...

341
00:37:34,423 --> 00:37:38,827
...whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to
her death, was Madeleine's grandmother.

342
00:37:39,294 --> 00:37:42,764
And the McKittrick Hotel
is the old Valds home.

343
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:46,334
I think that explains it.

344
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:50,539
Anyone could become obsessed
with the past with a background like that.

345
00:37:51,573 --> 00:37:53,675
She never heard of Carlotta Valds.

346
00:37:54,342 --> 00:37:57,079
She knows nothing of a grave out
at the Mission Dolores?

347
00:37:57,145 --> 00:37:59,214
Or that old house on Eddy Street?

348
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:02,751
The portrait at
the Palace of the Legion of...

349
00:38:03,351 --> 00:38:05,887
- Nothing.
- When she goes to these places--

350
00:38:06,021 --> 00:38:07,923
She's no longer my wife.

351
00:38:09,591 --> 00:38:12,127
How do you know
all these things she doesn't?

352
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,363
Her mother told me most of them
before she died.

353
00:38:15,497 --> 00:38:17,232
I dug out the rest for myself here.

354
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:20,435
- Why wouldn't she tell her daughter?
- Natural fear.

355
00:38:21,236 --> 00:38:24,172
Her grandmother went insane,
took her own life.

356
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:26,541
Her blood is in Madeleine.

357
00:38:33,148 --> 00:38:34,683
Boy, I need this.

358
00:41:54,248 --> 00:41:55,483
Madeleine.

359
00:41:56,918 --> 00:41:58,219
Madeleine!

360
00:42:57,344 --> 00:42:58,412
Yes?

361
00:43:00,648 --> 00:43:02,316
No, it's all right.

362
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:04,852
Yeah, I'll call you back.

363
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:06,387
Yes.

364
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:12,026
You all right?

365
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,232
You'll want this.

366
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:55,636
You'd better come over here
by the fire where it's warm.

367
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,109
What am I doing here?

368
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,912
What happened?

369
00:44:06,613 --> 00:44:10,117
Well, you fell into San Francisco Bay.

370
00:44:12,252 --> 00:44:15,589
And I tried to dry your hair as best I could.

371
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:19,259
Your things are in the kitchen.
They'll be dry in a few minutes.

372
00:44:19,593 --> 00:44:21,528
Come on over by the fire.

373
00:44:29,436 --> 00:44:31,472
I'll get you some cushions.

374
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:36,109
There you are.

375
00:44:44,117 --> 00:44:46,286
Would you like to have some coffee?

376
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:52,125
Here, you'd better have some.
Or perhaps you'd like a drink?

377
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:58,599
I fell into the Bay and you fished me out?

378
00:44:58,765 --> 00:45:00,100
That's right.

379
00:45:00,968 --> 00:45:03,904
- Thank you.
- You don't remember?

380
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:06,306
No, I...

381
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:10,577
Do you remember where you were?

382
00:45:12,779 --> 00:45:15,582
Yes. Of course I remember that.

383
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:21,455
But then I must have had
a dizzy spell and fainted.

384
00:45:21,655 --> 00:45:23,123
Where were you?

385
00:45:23,824 --> 00:45:27,160
At Old Fort Point. Out at the Presidio.

386
00:45:28,996 --> 00:45:31,465
Of course I remember. I often go there.

387
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:33,433
Why? Why do you go there?

388
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:37,137
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there.

389
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:40,006
Especially at sunset.

390
00:45:42,209 --> 00:45:43,977
Thank you for the fire.

391
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:45,912
Where were you before?

392
00:45:46,346 --> 00:45:48,482
- When?
- This afternoon, I mean.

393
00:45:50,484 --> 00:45:51,818
Wandering about.

394
00:45:52,018 --> 00:45:54,855
I know, but where?
Where were you just before?

395
00:45:57,924 --> 00:45:59,593
Downtown, shopping.

396
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:04,164
Here, you'd better have some coffee.

397
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:06,166
I think it's still warm.

398
00:46:08,301 --> 00:46:10,670
You're terribly direct in your questions.

399
00:46:10,737 --> 00:46:13,173
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

400
00:46:14,508 --> 00:46:16,843
You're not. You're merely direct.

401
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,483
And what were you doing there,
at Old Fort Point?

402
00:46:24,651 --> 00:46:26,353
Just wandering about.

403
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:28,955
- You like it, too?
- Yes.

404
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:32,392
And where had you been just before?

405
00:46:32,525 --> 00:46:36,263
I'd been to the Palace of the Legion
of Honor, the art gallery.

406
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,532
Yes, that's a lovely spot, isn't it?

407
00:46:39,899 --> 00:46:43,536
I've never been inside,
but it looks so lovely driving past.

408
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:52,345
It's lucky for me,
you were wandering about.

409
00:46:52,712 --> 00:46:53,980
Thank you.

410
00:46:54,114 --> 00:46:55,915
I've been a terrible bother to you.

411
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:57,550
No, you haven't.

412
00:47:00,887 --> 00:47:02,188
When you...

413
00:47:06,593 --> 00:47:08,428
There were some pins in my hair.

414
00:47:08,528 --> 00:47:11,431
The pins, yes. Right in here.
I'll get 'em for you.

415
00:47:11,531 --> 00:47:13,233
And my purse, please.

416
00:47:18,304 --> 00:47:20,206
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

417
00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:25,445
You shouldn't have brought me here.

418
00:47:25,678 --> 00:47:27,614
I didn't know where you lived.

419
00:47:28,915 --> 00:47:32,719
You could have looked in my car.
But you didn't know my car, did you?

420
00:47:33,052 --> 00:47:35,588
I knew which one it was.
It's right outside here now.

421
00:47:35,688 --> 00:47:38,792
But I didn't think you wanted
to be taken home that way.

422
00:47:39,092 --> 00:47:40,260
No, you're right.

423
00:47:40,326 --> 00:47:43,663
I'm glad you didn't take me home.
I wouldn't have known you.

424
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:48,101
Thank you. But I don't know you
and you don't know me.

425
00:47:48,468 --> 00:47:51,604
- My name is Madeleine Elster.
- My name's John Ferguson.

426
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:55,441
Good, strong name.
Do your friends call you John or Jack?

427
00:47:56,276 --> 00:47:57,677
John, mostly.

428
00:47:57,877 --> 00:48:00,947
Old friends call me John.
Acquaintances call me Scottie.

429
00:48:01,714 --> 00:48:03,483
I shall call you Mr.Ferguson.

430
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,752
Gee whiz, I wouldn't like that.

431
00:48:06,819 --> 00:48:10,523
After what happened this afternoon,
I should think you'd call me Scottie.

432
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,158
Maybe even John.

433
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:14,060
I prefer John.

434
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:20,333
There, that's done.
And what do you do, John?

435
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:23,436
I wander about.

436
00:48:23,536 --> 00:48:26,639
That's a good occupation.
And you live here, alone?

437
00:48:28,608 --> 00:48:31,377
- One shouldn't live alone.
- Some people prefer it.

438
00:48:33,546 --> 00:48:34,947
No, it's wrong.

439
00:48:38,117 --> 00:48:39,652
I'm married, you know.

440
00:48:43,856 --> 00:48:47,860
Will you tell me something?
Has this ever happened to you before?

441
00:48:48,728 --> 00:48:49,729
What?

442
00:48:50,463 --> 00:48:52,665
Falling into San Francisco Bay.

443
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:57,603
No, it's never happened before.

444
00:48:58,037 --> 00:49:01,774
I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats,
when I was a little girl.

445
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:06,412
I even fell into the river once
trying to leap from one stone to another.

446
00:49:06,846 --> 00:49:09,682
But I've never fallen
into San Francisco Bay.

447
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:12,618
Have you ever before?

448
00:49:12,785 --> 00:49:15,321
No, it's the first time for me, too.

449
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:19,959
I'll get you some more coffee.

450
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,776
- Hello?
<i>- Scottie, what happened? She's not home yet.</i>

451
00:49:36,842 --> 00:49:40,413
She's all right. She's still here.
I'll bring her home soon.

452
00:49:41,013 --> 00:49:43,316
<i>- What happened?</i>
- She went into the Bay.

453
00:49:46,252 --> 00:49:48,487
- Hello? Hello?
<i>- Did she hurt herself?</i>

454
00:49:48,654 --> 00:49:51,190
No, she's gonna be in fine shape.
There's nothing to worry about.

455
00:49:51,257 --> 00:49:53,726
But she doesn't know.
Now, do you understand that?

456
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,095
She doesn't know what happened.

457
00:49:59,231 --> 00:50:01,334
<i>Scottie, Madeleine is 26.</i>

458
00:50:02,401 --> 00:50:05,504
<i>Carlotta Valds committed suicide</i>
<i>when she was 26.</i>

459
00:50:06,939 --> 00:50:09,008
Just hold on a minute, Gavin.

460
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:40,206
Well now, Johnny-O. Was it a ghost?

461
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,641
Was it fun?

462
00:53:05,951 --> 00:53:07,619
Is that letter for me?

463
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,793
- Yes. Hello.
- Hello.

464
00:53:15,627 --> 00:53:19,331
I worried about you last night.
You shouldn't have run off that way.

465
00:53:19,598 --> 00:53:21,833
Well, I suddenly felt such a fool.

466
00:53:21,933 --> 00:53:24,169
I wanted to drive you home.
Are you all right?

467
00:53:24,236 --> 00:53:26,705
Yes, I'm fine. No aftereffects.

468
00:53:28,774 --> 00:53:30,942
As I remember now,
the water was cold, wasn't it?

469
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:34,079
- It sure was.
- What a terrible thing for me to do.

470
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:36,214
You were so kind.

471
00:53:37,616 --> 00:53:40,819
It's a formal thank-you note
and a great big apology.

472
00:53:40,952 --> 00:53:43,755
- You've nothing to apologize for.
- Yes, I do.

473
00:53:43,922 --> 00:53:46,458
The whole thing must have been
so embarrassing for you.

474
00:53:46,491 --> 00:53:48,393
Not at all. I enjoyed...

475
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:51,630
...talking to you.

476
00:53:53,832 --> 00:53:55,800
I enjoyed talking to you.

477
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:01,306
I'll get my mail.

478
00:54:02,974 --> 00:54:06,077
- Would you like to have a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

479
00:54:09,114 --> 00:54:12,450
I couldn't mail it. I didn't know
your address, but I had a landmark.

480
00:54:12,517 --> 00:54:15,186
I remembered Coit Tower.
It led me straight to you.

481
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,356
That's the first time
I've been grateful for Coit Tower.

482
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,596
- I hope we will too.
- What?

483
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:27,499
- Meet again sometime.
- We have.

484
00:54:30,869 --> 00:54:32,037
Good-bye.

485
00:54:47,552 --> 00:54:49,320
Where are you going?

486
00:54:49,921 --> 00:54:50,889
I don't know.

487
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:52,390
- Shopping?
- No.

488
00:54:52,891 --> 00:54:54,659
Anywhere in particular?

489
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:58,096
I just thought that I'd wander.

490
00:54:59,064 --> 00:55:01,266
That's what I was going to do.

491
00:55:02,233 --> 00:55:06,371
That's right. I forgot.
It's your occupation, isn't it?

492
00:55:06,571 --> 00:55:09,174
Don't you think it's a waste
for the two of us...

493
00:55:09,274 --> 00:55:10,975
...to wander separately?

494
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:13,445
But only one is a wanderer.

495
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:15,814
Two together are always
going somewhere.

496
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,383
I don't think that's necessarily true.

497
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:22,353
- You left your door open.
- Be right back.

498
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:05,530
How old?

499
00:56:05,697 --> 00:56:07,899
Some 2,000 years or more.

500
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:10,935
- The oldest living things.
- Yes.

501
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:14,572
- You've never been here before?
- No.

502
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:16,708
What are you thinking?

503
00:56:17,308 --> 00:56:19,777
Of all the people who've been born
and have died...

504
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,546
...while the trees went on living.

505
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:25,650
Their true name is <i>Sequoia sempervirens.</i>
"Always green, ever living."

506
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:28,219
- I don't like them.
- Why?

507
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:30,655
Knowing I have to die.

508
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:49,707
Here's a cross section of one
of the old trees that's been cut down.

509
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,902
Somewhere in here I was born...

510
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:21,839
...and there I died.

511
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:25,009
It was only a moment for you.

512
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,378
You took no notice.

513
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,555
Madeleine.

514
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:25,669
Madeleine, where are you now?

515
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,606
- Here with you.
- Where?

516
00:58:29,707 --> 00:58:32,576
- The tall trees...
- Have you been here before?

517
00:58:32,977 --> 00:58:34,278
- Yes.
- When?

518
00:58:36,313 --> 00:58:37,915
When were you born?

519
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:40,317
- Long ago.
- Where?

520
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:42,686
When? Tell me.

521
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,622
- Madeleine, tell me.
- No!

522
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:47,725
- Where do you go? What takes you away?
- I can't tell you.

523
00:58:47,825 --> 00:58:50,628
When you jumped into the Bay,
you didn't know where you were.

524
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:53,797
- I didn't jump. You told me I fell.
- Why did you jump?

525
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:57,434
- I can't tell you.
- What was inside that told you to jump?

526
00:58:57,935 --> 00:58:59,270
- Please.
- What?

527
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:01,205
Please, don't ask me.

528
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,775
Take me away from here.

529
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:07,378
Shall I take you home?

530
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:11,048
Somewhere in the light.

531
00:59:11,649 --> 00:59:14,985
Promise you won't ask me again.
Please promise me that.

532
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:49,853
Why did you run?

533
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,256
I'm responsible for you now.

534
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,526
The Chinese say
that once you've saved a person's life...

535
00:59:55,626 --> 00:59:58,695
...you're responsible for it forever,
so I'm committed.

536
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:00,497
I have to know.

537
01:00:01,532 --> 01:00:03,700
There's so little that I know.

538
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:12,009
It's as though I were walking
down a long corridor...

539
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:18,048
...that once was mirrored, and fragments
of that mirror still hang there...

540
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:21,618
...and when I come to the end
of the corridor...

541
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:23,954
...there's nothing but darkness.

542
01:00:25,589 --> 01:00:28,258
And I know that
when I walk into the darkness...

543
01:00:30,694 --> 01:00:32,095
...that I'll die.

544
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:37,701
I've never come to the end.
I've always come back before then.

545
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,837
- Except once.
- Yesterday?

546
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:45,542
And you didn't know what happened
till you found yourself with me.

547
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,344
You didn't know where you were.

548
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:51,048
But the small scenes, the fragments
of the mirror, you remember those.

549
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:53,016
- Vaguely.
- What do you remember?

550
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:54,985
There's a room...

551
01:00:55,686 --> 01:00:57,521
...and I sit there alone.

552
01:00:57,721 --> 01:00:59,790
- Always alone.
- What else?

553
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,559
- A grave.
- Where?

554
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,163
I don't know. It's an open grave and...

555
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:10,500
...I stand by the gravestone
looking down into it.

556
01:01:11,068 --> 01:01:13,070
- It's my grave.
- How do you know?

557
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:16,706
- I know.
- But is there a name on the gravestone?

558
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:18,475
No.

559
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:22,579
No, it's new and clean and waiting.

560
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,615
What else?

561
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:28,285
This part is a dream, I think.

562
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:34,257
There's a tower and a bell,
and a garden below.

563
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:37,160
It seems to be in Spain...

564
01:01:37,828 --> 01:01:39,496
...a village in Spain.

565
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:42,299
It clicks off and it's gone.

566
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:44,134
Well, a portrait?

567
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:46,736
- Do you see a portrait?
- No.

568
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:49,773
If I could just find the key, the beginning...

569
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,708
...and put it together, I...

570
01:01:51,775 --> 01:01:53,643
And so explain it away?

571
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:57,414
There is a way to explain it, you see.

572
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:01,918
If I'm mad, then that would explain it,
wouldn't it?

573
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:05,622
Madeleine!

574
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:11,194
Scottie!

575
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,998
I'm not mad! I'm not mad!
I don't want to die.

576
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,969
There's someone within me,
and she says I must die.

577
01:02:19,002 --> 01:02:20,904
Scottie, don't let me go.

578
01:02:21,438 --> 01:02:23,840
I'm here. I've got you.

579
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:26,109
I'm so afraid.

580
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:37,387
Don't leave me.

581
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:40,023
- Stay with me.
- All the time.

582
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:07,717
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hi.

583
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,621
- Did you get my message?
- I did, indeed.

584
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:14,357
I'll get you a drink.

585
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:15,625
Okay.

586
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:19,462
Since when do you go around
slipping notes under men's doors?

587
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,332
Since I stopped being able to get them
on the phone.

588
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:25,969
For a man who has nothing to do,
you're certainly a busy little bee.

589
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,804
Where do you go these days?

590
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:29,505
Just wandering.

591
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,042
- Where?
- Round about.

592
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:40,783
What was this desperate urge to see me?

593
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:43,753
All I said in my note was:
"Where are you?"

594
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,256
Doesn't sound very desperate to me.

595
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,758
I detected a little undercurrent.

596
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:53,663
I just thought that if I gave you a drink
and fed you some dinner...

597
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:56,199
...you'd be so grateful
you'd take me to a movie.

598
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:59,502
That's fair enough.
What'll we talk about at dinner?

599
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,472
This and that.

600
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,008
What I've been doing?

601
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,110
If you want to.

602
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:09,812
We won't talk about anything
you don't want to.

603
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,280
Naturally.

604
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:16,119
What have you been doing?

605
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,488
Wandering.

606
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,760
What have you been doing?
Thank you, dear.

607
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,195
I've been having a wonderful time.

608
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:29,866
- I've gone back to my first love: painting.
- Good for you.

609
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:33,302
I always said you were wasting your time
in the underwear department.

610
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:36,672
It's a living.
But I'm really excited about this.

611
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,775
What is it? A still life?

612
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:41,277
No, not exactly.

613
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:43,880
You want to see?

614
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:47,450
I thought I might give it to you.

615
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:03,933
It's not funny, Midge.

616
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:08,704
I just thought...

617
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,744
Let's make that movie some other night.

618
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,692
Marjorie Wood, you fool!

619
01:05:30,926 --> 01:05:32,028
Idiot!

620
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,104
Stupid! Stupid!

621
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,710
Madeleine! What's the matter?

622
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:25,247
I should have phoned,
but I wanted to see you, be with you.

623
01:06:25,347 --> 01:06:27,983
- Why? What's happened?
- I had the dream.

624
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:31,320
- The dream came back again.
- It's gonna be all right.

625
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:34,990
It'll be all right. I'll get you some brandy.

626
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:37,092
Drink this down.

627
01:06:37,726 --> 01:06:39,395
Just like medicine.

628
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,464
There now.

629
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:46,068
It was a dream. You're awake.
You're all right now.

630
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:49,071
Now, can you tell me?

631
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:54,009
It was the tower again,
and the bell and the old Spanish village.

632
01:06:54,109 --> 01:06:57,046
- Yes?
- Clear, so very clear for the first time.

633
01:06:57,379 --> 01:06:58,447
Tell me.

634
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:01,784
It was a village square
and a green with trees...

635
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:04,853
...and an old whitewashed
Spanish church with a cloister.

636
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:08,290
Across the green,
there was a big, gray wooden house...

637
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:11,226
...with a porch and a balcony
above a small garden...

638
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:14,863
...and next to it a livery stable
with old carriages lined up inside.

639
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:16,065
Go on.

640
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:19,435
At the end of the green,
there was a whitewashed stone house...

641
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,570
...with a lovely pepper tree at the corner.

642
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,606
And an old wooden hotel
from the old California days?

643
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:29,044
And a saloon? Dark, low ceilings,
with hanging oil lamps?

644
01:07:29,978 --> 01:07:32,114
- Yes.
- It's all there.

645
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:34,516
It's no dream.

646
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:39,321
You've been there before. You've seen it.

647
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:42,057
No, never.

648
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:45,828
A hundred miles south of San Francisco,
there's an old Spanish mission...

649
01:07:45,894 --> 01:07:48,664
...San Juan Bautista it's called
and it's been preserved...

650
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:51,300
...exactly as it was 100 years ago
as a museum.

651
01:07:51,366 --> 01:07:53,969
Think hard, darling. Think hard.

652
01:07:54,803 --> 01:07:58,307
- You've been there before. You've seen it.
- I've never been there.

653
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,776
- What is it? I've never been there.
- Think hard.

654
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:03,378
Go on about your dream.
What frightened you?

655
01:08:03,812 --> 01:08:06,748
I stood alone on the green
searching for something...

656
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,152
...and then I started to walk to the church...

657
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:15,023
...but then the darkness closed in
and I was alone in the dark...

658
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:19,595
...being pulled into the darkness,
and I fought to wake up.

659
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:23,131
You're going to be all right now.

660
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,701
You've given me
something to work on now.

661
01:08:25,767 --> 01:08:28,003
I'll take you to that mission this afternoon.

662
01:08:28,036 --> 01:08:30,672
When you see it,
you'll remember when you saw it before.

663
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:33,842
It'll finish your dream.
It'll destroy it, I promise you.

664
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:35,844
All right?

665
01:08:37,879 --> 01:08:41,450
- Come on, now. I'll take you home.
- No. I'll be all right.

666
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,519
You'll come back here around noon.

667
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:03,465
Madeleine, where are you now?

668
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,836
- Here with you.
- And it's all real!

669
01:10:08,269 --> 01:10:10,538
It's not merely as it was 100 years ago...

670
01:10:10,605 --> 01:10:14,776
...or a year ago or six months ago or
whenever it was you were here to see it.

671
01:10:14,876 --> 01:10:17,612
Now, Madeleine,
think of when you were here.

672
01:10:19,781 --> 01:10:22,283
There were not so many carriages then.

673
01:10:23,785 --> 01:10:26,121
There were horses in the stalls...

674
01:10:27,255 --> 01:10:29,324
...a bay, two black and a gray.

675
01:10:31,459 --> 01:10:33,495
It was our favorite place...

676
01:10:35,296 --> 01:10:37,632
...but we were forbidden to play here.

677
01:10:37,665 --> 01:10:41,002
And Sister Teresa would scold us.

678
01:10:45,106 --> 01:10:47,876
Look at this. Here's your gray horse.

679
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:53,982
Have a little trouble getting in and out
of the stall without being pushed.

680
01:10:54,015 --> 01:10:56,751
You see? There's an answer
for everything.

681
01:11:01,022 --> 01:11:03,424
Madeleine, try.

682
01:11:08,663 --> 01:11:09,998
Try for me.

683
01:11:29,684 --> 01:11:32,353
- I love you, Madeleine.
- I love you, too.

684
01:11:32,754 --> 01:11:35,356
- Too late. Too late.
- No. We're together.

685
01:11:35,523 --> 01:11:38,226
No, it's too late.
There's something I must do.

686
01:11:38,326 --> 01:11:40,561
No. There's nothing you must do.

687
01:11:41,195 --> 01:11:43,264
There's nothing you must do.

688
01:11:45,366 --> 01:11:48,036
No one possesses you.
You're safe with me.

689
01:11:54,442 --> 01:11:56,077
No. It's too late.

690
01:12:08,089 --> 01:12:11,926
It's not fair. It's too late.
It wasn't supposed to happen this way.

691
01:12:12,026 --> 01:12:14,595
It had to happen. We're in love.
That's what counts.

692
01:12:14,662 --> 01:12:16,898
- Please let me go!
- Listen to me.

693
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:25,239
- You believe I love you?
- Yes.

694
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:29,143
And if you lose me, then you'll know...

695
01:12:29,277 --> 01:12:31,779
...I loved you and wanted
to go on loving you.

696
01:12:32,046 --> 01:12:33,414
I won't lose you.

697
01:12:35,983 --> 01:12:38,753
- Let me go into the church, alone.
- But why?

698
01:13:00,141 --> 01:13:01,242
Madeleine!

699
01:15:19,246 --> 01:15:24,118
Mr.Elster, suspecting all was not well
with his wife's mental state...

700
01:15:25,085 --> 01:15:29,223
...took the preliminary precaution
of having her watched by Mr.Ferguson...

701
01:15:29,356 --> 01:15:31,191
...lest any harm befall her.

702
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:33,827
And you've heard
that Mr.Elster was prepared...

703
01:15:33,927 --> 01:15:36,263
...to take his wife to an institution...

704
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:40,701
...where her mental health would've been
in the hands of qualified specialists.

705
01:15:41,468 --> 01:15:44,805
Mr.Ferguson, being an ex-detective,
would have seemed...

706
01:15:44,938 --> 01:15:48,308
...the proper choice for the role
of watchdog and protector.

707
01:15:48,642 --> 01:15:51,478
As you have learned,
it was an unfortunate choice.

708
01:15:51,545 --> 01:15:55,249
However, I think you'll agree that no blame
can be attached to the husband.

709
01:15:55,282 --> 01:15:57,784
His delay in putting his wife
under medical care...

710
01:15:57,818 --> 01:16:01,488
...was due only to the need
for information as to her behavior...

711
01:16:01,622 --> 01:16:04,057
...which he expected to get
from Mr.Ferguson.

712
01:16:04,157 --> 01:16:06,793
He had taken every precaution
to protect his wife.

713
01:16:06,827 --> 01:16:09,796
He could not have anticipated
that Mr.Ferguson's weakness...

714
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:11,498
...his fear of heights...

715
01:16:11,732 --> 01:16:14,434
...would make him powerless
when he was most needed.

716
01:16:14,534 --> 01:16:16,236
As to Mr.Ferguson...

717
01:16:17,137 --> 01:16:19,506
...you have heard his former superior...

718
01:16:19,706 --> 01:16:23,276
...Detective Captain Hansen,
from that great city to the north...

719
01:16:23,377 --> 01:16:26,013
...testify as to his character and ability.

720
01:16:26,313 --> 01:16:28,615
Captain Hansen was most enthusiastic.

721
01:16:28,849 --> 01:16:31,752
The fact that once before,
under similar circumstances...

722
01:16:31,852 --> 01:16:36,089
...Mr.Ferguson allowed a police colleague
to fall to his death...

723
01:16:36,189 --> 01:16:39,426
...Captain Hansen dismissed
as an "unfortunate incident."

724
01:16:41,395 --> 01:16:43,764
Of course, Mr.Ferguson
is to be congratulated...

725
01:16:43,864 --> 01:16:46,299
...on having once saved the woman's life...

726
01:16:46,566 --> 01:16:50,704
...when, in a previous fit of aberration,
she threw herself into the Bay.

727
01:16:51,471 --> 01:16:54,875
It is a pity that,
knowing her suicidal tendencies...

728
01:16:55,675 --> 01:16:58,612
...he did not make a greater effort
the second time.

729
01:17:01,214 --> 01:17:05,218
But we are not here to pass judgment
on Mr.Ferguson's lack of initiative.

730
01:17:05,385 --> 01:17:06,920
He did nothing...

731
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:10,857
...and the law has little to say
on the subject of things left undone.

732
01:17:10,891 --> 01:17:15,896
Nor does his strange behavior
after he saw the body fall...

733
01:17:16,763 --> 01:17:19,065
...have any bearing on your verdict.

734
01:17:19,866 --> 01:17:23,203
He did not remain at the scene
of the death. He left.

735
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:27,240
He claims he suffered a mental blackout
and knew nothing more...

736
01:17:27,374 --> 01:17:31,912
...until he found himself back in his own
apartment in San Francisco hours later.

737
01:17:32,178 --> 01:17:34,381
You may accept that, or not.

738
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:39,953
Or you may believe that, having once again
allowed someone to die...

739
01:17:40,654 --> 01:17:43,924
...he could not face the tragic result
of his own weakness...

740
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:45,458
...and ran away.

741
01:17:47,727 --> 01:17:50,397
That has nothing to do with your verdict.

742
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:53,933
It is a matter between him
and his own conscience.

743
01:17:55,802 --> 01:18:00,273
From the evidence of the state of mind
of Madeleine Elster prior to her death...

744
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:04,077
...from the manner of her death and
the postmortem examination of the body...

745
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:06,079
...showing the actual cause of her death...

746
01:18:06,179 --> 01:18:08,948
...you should have no difficulty
in reaching your verdict.

747
01:18:09,015 --> 01:18:11,317
Gentlemen, you may retire if you wish.

748
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:15,889
Hold it, Mr.Jones.

749
01:18:36,876 --> 01:18:39,345
- We've reached a verdict.
- Thank you.

750
01:18:42,582 --> 01:18:45,618
"The jury finds that Madeleine Elster
committed suicide...

751
01:18:45,652 --> 01:18:47,554
"...while of unsound mind."

752
01:18:48,388 --> 01:18:51,191
Your verdict will be so recorded.
Dismissed.

753
01:18:57,197 --> 01:18:59,999
- Scottie, let's go.
- Mind if I speak to him for a minute?

754
01:19:00,133 --> 01:19:01,334
Go ahead.

755
01:19:07,674 --> 01:19:09,842
Sorry, Scottie. That was rough.

756
01:19:10,243 --> 01:19:12,612
He had no right to speak to you like that.

757
01:19:12,745 --> 01:19:16,349
It was my responsibility.
I shouldn't have got you involved.

758
01:19:16,649 --> 01:19:19,385
No, there's nothing you have to say to me.

759
01:19:19,686 --> 01:19:22,088
I'm getting out, Scottie, for good.

760
01:19:22,188 --> 01:19:23,823
I can't stay here.

761
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:27,160
I'm going to wind up her affairs,
and mine...

762
01:19:27,593 --> 01:19:29,495
...get away as far as I can.

763
01:19:30,296 --> 01:19:31,831
Europe, perhaps.

764
01:19:32,465 --> 01:19:34,934
And I probably never will come back.

765
01:19:35,835 --> 01:19:37,437
Good-bye, Scottie.

766
01:19:38,971 --> 01:19:42,041
If there's anything I can do for you
before I go...

767
01:19:43,643 --> 01:19:45,878
There's no way for them to understand.

768
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,515
You and I know who killed Madeleine.

769
01:19:56,923 --> 01:19:58,958
Come on, Scottie. Let's get out of here.

770
01:22:02,014 --> 01:22:05,317
It's Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus.

771
01:22:06,852 --> 01:22:09,855
I had a long talk with that lady
in Musical Therapy...

772
01:22:09,989 --> 01:22:12,491
...and she says
that Mozart's the boy for you...

773
01:22:12,524 --> 01:22:15,094
...the broom that sweeps
the cobwebs away.

774
01:22:17,496 --> 01:22:19,365
It's what the lady said.

775
01:22:22,601 --> 01:22:25,604
It's wonderful how
they have it all taped now, John.

776
01:22:25,671 --> 01:22:29,908
They have music for dipsomaniacs,
and music for melancholiacs...

777
01:22:30,075 --> 01:22:32,177
...and music for hypochondriacs.

778
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:36,615
I wonder what would happen
if somebody got their files mixed up.

779
01:22:46,692 --> 01:22:50,062
I brought a lot of other things,
and you can see what you like.

780
01:22:50,429 --> 01:22:52,364
It shuts off automatically.

781
01:23:00,506 --> 01:23:02,107
Johnny, please try.

782
01:23:02,674 --> 01:23:04,042
Try, Johnny.

783
01:23:04,476 --> 01:23:07,146
You're not lost. Mother is here.

784
01:23:11,617 --> 01:23:12,684
Time?

785
01:23:16,388 --> 01:23:18,190
I'll be in again, John.

786
01:23:18,924 --> 01:23:20,993
You want me to shut that off?

787
01:23:43,015 --> 01:23:45,450
You don't even know I'm here, do you?

788
01:23:49,087 --> 01:23:50,489
But I'm here.

789
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:06,938
Nurse, could I see the doctor
for a moment?

790
01:24:08,106 --> 01:24:09,641
Doctor, Miss Wood.

791
01:24:11,443 --> 01:24:13,345
Won't you go in, please?

792
01:24:14,146 --> 01:24:15,614
Yes, Miss Wood?

793
01:24:15,981 --> 01:24:19,718
Doctor, how long is it going to take you
to pull him out of this?

794
01:24:19,918 --> 01:24:22,988
It's hard to say. At least six months.
Perhaps a year.

795
01:24:23,455 --> 01:24:24,990
It really could depend on him.

796
01:24:25,123 --> 01:24:27,059
- He won't talk.
- No.

797
01:24:27,793 --> 01:24:30,295
He's suffering from acute melancholia...

798
01:24:30,362 --> 01:24:32,230
...together with a guilt complex.

799
01:24:32,330 --> 01:24:34,699
He blames himself
for what happened to the woman.

800
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,302
We know little of what went on before.

801
01:24:37,903 --> 01:24:40,939
I can give you one thing:
He was in love with her.

802
01:24:41,907 --> 01:24:44,443
That does complicate the problem,
doesn't it?

803
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:48,013
I can give you another complication:
He still is.

804
01:24:49,014 --> 01:24:50,582
And you want to know something?

805
01:24:50,715 --> 01:24:53,485
I don't think Mozart's going to help at all.

806
01:26:20,105 --> 01:26:22,874
- Where'd you get this car?
- I beg your pardon?

807
01:26:23,441 --> 01:26:26,177
I bought it from a man who used to live
in this building.

808
01:26:26,244 --> 01:26:29,380
Mr.Gavin Elster.
I bought it from him when he moved away.

809
01:26:30,315 --> 01:26:32,250
You knew him and his wife!

810
01:26:32,517 --> 01:26:34,319
The poor thing. I didn't know her.

811
01:26:34,385 --> 01:26:37,455
- Is it true that she really--
- I'm sorry.

812
01:26:58,343 --> 01:27:00,411
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

813
01:27:25,503 --> 01:27:27,171
Give me a scotch and soda.

814
01:29:59,823 --> 01:30:03,327
- What is it?
- Could I ask you a couple of questions?

815
01:30:03,661 --> 01:30:06,497
- What for? Who are you?
- My name is John Ferguson.

816
01:30:06,730 --> 01:30:08,799
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll?

817
01:30:09,667 --> 01:30:12,436
- There are some things I'd like to ask.
- You live in this hotel?

818
01:30:12,536 --> 01:30:15,039
No. I happened to see you
when you came in, so I--

819
01:30:15,105 --> 01:30:17,007
Yeah, I thought so. A pickup.

820
01:30:17,241 --> 01:30:20,811
You've got a nerve, following me
into the hotel and up to my room.

821
01:30:21,145 --> 01:30:24,515
- Now, you beat it.
- Please. I just want to talk to you.

822
01:30:24,848 --> 01:30:26,450
I'm gonna yell in a minute.

823
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:29,253
I'm not gonna hurt you. Honest.
I promise.

824
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:32,256
Please. Just let me talk to you.

825
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:34,658
- What about?
- You.

826
01:30:35,025 --> 01:30:37,695
- Why?
- Because you remind me of somebody.

827
01:30:39,329 --> 01:30:41,098
I heard that one before, too.

828
01:30:41,832 --> 01:30:44,401
I remind you of someone
you were madly in love with...

829
01:30:44,468 --> 01:30:46,503
...but then she ditched you
for another guy...

830
01:30:46,603 --> 01:30:49,239
...and you've been carrying a torch
ever since.

831
01:30:49,339 --> 01:30:51,909
Then you saw me and something clicked.

832
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:54,912
You're not far wrong.

833
01:30:54,978 --> 01:30:58,248
- It's not gonna work, so go.
- Please, let me come in.

834
01:30:59,383 --> 01:31:03,520
You can leave the door open.
I just want to talk to you. Please.

835
01:31:06,056 --> 01:31:08,625
Well, I warn you, I can yell awful loud.

836
01:31:08,859 --> 01:31:10,461
You won't have to.

837
01:31:11,695 --> 01:31:16,934
You don't look much like Jack the Ripper.
What do you want to know?

838
01:31:17,201 --> 01:31:19,136
- I want to know your name.
- Judy Barton.

839
01:31:19,203 --> 01:31:21,538
- Who you are.
- I'm just a girl. I work at Magnin's.

840
01:31:21,638 --> 01:31:25,542
- How do you happen to be living here?
- It's a place to live, that's all.

841
01:31:25,709 --> 01:31:28,645
- But you haven't lived here long?
- Yeah, about three years.

842
01:31:28,745 --> 01:31:31,281
- Where did you live before?
- Salina, Kansas!

843
01:31:32,883 --> 01:31:35,252
Listen, what is this? What do you want?

844
01:31:35,886 --> 01:31:38,855
- I just want to know who you are.
- Well, I told you.

845
01:31:40,891 --> 01:31:43,827
My name is Judy Barton.
I come from Salina, Kansas.

846
01:31:44,027 --> 01:31:46,096
I work at Magnin's and I live here.

847
01:31:48,432 --> 01:31:50,400
My gosh, do I have to prove it?

848
01:31:55,839 --> 01:31:58,709
All right, mister,
my Kansas driver's license.

849
01:31:59,343 --> 01:32:02,512
"Judy Barton, number Z296794.

850
01:32:02,646 --> 01:32:05,682
"425 Maple Avenue, Salina, Kansas."

851
01:32:09,152 --> 01:32:12,522
See the address on this one?
It's this place right here.

852
01:32:13,056 --> 01:32:16,760
A California license issued May 25, 1954.

853
01:32:18,462 --> 01:32:21,465
You want to check my thumbprints?
You satisfied?

854
01:32:23,133 --> 01:32:26,470
Whether you're satisfied or not,
you can just beat it.

855
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:33,143
You have got it bad, haven't you?

856
01:32:35,812 --> 01:32:37,747
Do I really look like her?

857
01:32:42,552 --> 01:32:44,621
She's dead, isn't she?

858
01:32:49,092 --> 01:32:52,095
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry I yelled at you.

859
01:32:59,069 --> 01:33:01,238
Yes, that's me with my mother.

860
01:33:02,739 --> 01:33:04,241
And that's my father.

861
01:33:05,208 --> 01:33:08,645
He's dead. My mother married again,
but I didn't like the guy...

862
01:33:08,745 --> 01:33:12,182
...so I decided I'd see what it's like
in sunny California.

863
01:33:13,183 --> 01:33:15,218
I've been here three years.

864
01:33:15,752 --> 01:33:16,920
Honest.

865
01:33:26,463 --> 01:33:28,932
- Will you have dinner with me?
- Why?

866
01:33:29,633 --> 01:33:33,336
- I feel I owe you something after all this.
- You don't owe me anything.

867
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:36,272
- Then will you? For me?
- Dinner and what else?

868
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:40,443
- Just dinner.
- 'Cause I remind you of her?

869
01:33:40,844 --> 01:33:43,213
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.

870
01:33:47,784 --> 01:33:49,719
I've been on blind dates before.

871
01:33:50,019 --> 01:33:53,223
Matter of fact, to be honest,
I've been picked up before.

872
01:33:54,891 --> 01:33:55,759
Okay.

873
01:33:56,025 --> 01:33:58,661
I'll get my car. I'll be back in half an hour.

874
01:33:58,695 --> 01:34:01,865
- Give me time to change and get fixed up.
- An hour?

875
01:34:03,366 --> 01:34:04,367
Okay.

876
01:35:54,343 --> 01:35:55,845
<i>Dearest Scottie:</i>

877
01:35:56,679 --> 01:35:58,347
<i>And so you found me.</i>

878
01:35:58,748 --> 01:36:01,317
<i>This is the moment</i>
<i>that I dreaded and hoped for...</i>

879
01:36:01,417 --> 01:36:04,754
<i>...wondering what I would say and do</i>
<i>if I ever saw you again.</i>

880
01:36:05,154 --> 01:36:07,723
<i>I wanted so to see you again, just once.</i>

881
01:36:08,090 --> 01:36:10,693
<i>Now I'll go, and you can</i>
<i>give up your search.</i>

882
01:36:11,027 --> 01:36:15,131
<i>I want you to have peace of mind.</i>
<i>You've nothing to blame yourself for.</i>

883
01:36:15,264 --> 01:36:16,766
<i>You were the victim.</i>

884
01:36:16,832 --> 01:36:21,237
<i>I was the tool and you the victim</i>
<i>of Gavin Elster's plan to murder his wife.</i>

885
01:36:21,604 --> 01:36:25,908
<i>He chose me to play the part because</i>
<i>I looked like her. He dressed me like her.</i>

886
01:36:26,142 --> 01:36:30,046
<i>He was quite safe because she lived</i>
<i>in the country and rarely came to town.</i>

887
01:36:30,112 --> 01:36:32,848
<i>He chose you to be</i>
<i>the witness to a suicide.</i>

888
01:36:33,783 --> 01:36:36,352
<i>The Carlotta story was part real,</i>
<i>part invented...</i>

889
01:36:36,452 --> 01:36:39,789
<i>...to make you testify</i>
<i>that Madeleine wanted to kill herself.</i>

890
01:36:40,423 --> 01:36:44,527
<i>He knew of your illness. He knew</i>
<i>you'd never get up the stairs to the tower.</i>

891
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:47,596
<i>He planned it so well.</i>
<i>He made no mistakes.</i>

892
01:36:48,864 --> 01:36:51,233
<i>I made the mistake.</i>
<i>I fell in love.</i>

893
01:36:51,801 --> 01:36:53,903
<i>That wasn't part of the plan.</i>

894
01:36:54,737 --> 01:36:58,207
<i>I'm still in love with you,</i>
<i>and I want you so to love me.</i>

895
01:36:58,974 --> 01:37:01,077
<i>If I had the nerve, I'd stay and lie...</i>

896
01:37:01,210 --> 01:37:03,546
<i>...hoping that I could</i>
<i>make you love me again...</i>

897
01:37:03,612 --> 01:37:05,414
<i>...as I am, for myself...</i>

898
01:37:06,549 --> 01:37:09,919
<i>...and so forget the other</i>
<i>and forget the past. But...</i>

899
01:37:11,554 --> 01:37:14,457
<i>...I don't know whether</i>
<i>I have the nerve to try.</i>

900
01:39:25,354 --> 01:39:26,989
Here. I'll do it.

901
01:39:28,690 --> 01:39:31,693
- There you are.
- Thanks again. Good night.

902
01:39:31,827 --> 01:39:33,562
Can I see you tomorrow?

903
01:39:34,329 --> 01:39:37,566
- Tomorrow night? Well--
- No, I mean tomorrow morning.

904
01:39:40,435 --> 01:39:42,671
But I have to go to work. I've got a job.

905
01:39:42,771 --> 01:39:46,575
- Don't go to your job.
- What'll I live on? My oil wells in Texas?

906
01:39:46,942 --> 01:39:49,044
Let me take care of you, Judy.

907
01:39:50,846 --> 01:39:53,081
Thanks very much, but no, thanks.

908
01:39:54,349 --> 01:39:57,552
- No, Judy, you don't understand.
- I understand, all right.

909
01:39:57,753 --> 01:40:00,255
I've been understanding since I was 17.

910
01:40:00,989 --> 01:40:02,724
- And the next step is?
- No.

911
01:40:03,492 --> 01:40:05,494
No? Then what?

912
01:40:05,927 --> 01:40:07,496
We could just...

913
01:40:07,963 --> 01:40:09,931
...see a lot of each other...

914
01:40:10,665 --> 01:40:11,666
Why?

915
01:40:12,968 --> 01:40:14,836
'Cause I remind you of her?

916
01:40:20,108 --> 01:40:22,177
It's not very complimentary.

917
01:40:23,945 --> 01:40:25,380
And nothing else?

918
01:40:27,415 --> 01:40:28,383
No.

919
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:31,052
That's not very complimentary either.

920
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:33,922
I just want to be with you
as much as I can.

921
01:40:46,234 --> 01:40:47,402
Well...

922
01:40:48,403 --> 01:40:51,907
...I guess I could phone the store
in the morning...

923
01:40:53,775 --> 01:40:55,644
...and make some excuse.

924
01:41:59,574 --> 01:42:01,009
There you are.

925
01:42:02,677 --> 01:42:04,179
I like that one.

926
01:42:04,579 --> 01:42:06,114
- Like that?
- Yes.

927
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:09,083
- That's very nice.
- It's beautiful.

928
01:42:10,885 --> 01:42:12,353
There we are.

929
01:42:12,387 --> 01:42:15,256
We'll get this,
then we'll buy you those clothes.

930
01:42:15,323 --> 01:42:17,392
- Honest?
- Right over there's Ransohoffs.

931
01:42:17,492 --> 01:42:20,495
- Nothing but the best. How much?
- That'll be 50 cents.

932
01:42:20,528 --> 01:42:22,397
- Thank you.
- You don't have to.

933
01:42:22,463 --> 01:42:23,731
I want to.

934
01:42:45,787 --> 01:42:49,457
- No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
- But you said gray, sir.

935
01:42:49,724 --> 01:42:52,427
I just want an ordinary, simple gray suit.

936
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:55,997
- But I like that one, Scottie.
- No, it's not right.

937
01:42:56,898 --> 01:42:59,600
The gentleman seems to know
what he wants.

938
01:43:00,435 --> 01:43:02,303
All right. We'll find it.

939
01:43:09,510 --> 01:43:12,380
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to buy you a suit.

940
01:43:13,581 --> 01:43:15,950
But I love the second one she wore.

941
01:43:16,751 --> 01:43:20,254
- And this one, it's beautiful.
- They're none of them right.

942
01:43:20,788 --> 01:43:24,058
I think I know the suit you mean.
We had it some time ago.

943
01:43:24,125 --> 01:43:26,360
Let me see. We may still have that model.

944
01:43:26,461 --> 01:43:27,728
Thank you.

945
01:43:29,797 --> 01:43:32,467
You're looking for the suit
that she wore, for me.

946
01:43:32,533 --> 01:43:35,603
- You want me to dress like her.
- I just want you to look nice.

947
01:43:35,670 --> 01:43:39,073
- I know what suit would look well on you.
- No, I won't do it!

948
01:43:42,543 --> 01:43:43,444
Judy.

949
01:43:44,946 --> 01:43:47,548
It can't make a difference to you.
I just want to see--

950
01:43:47,615 --> 01:43:50,718
I don't want any clothes.
I want to get out of here.

951
01:43:50,818 --> 01:43:53,154
- Do this for me.
- Here we are.

952
01:43:54,155 --> 01:43:55,990
- Yes, that's it.
- I thought so.

953
01:43:56,824 --> 01:43:58,993
- I don't like it.
- We'll take it.

954
01:43:59,293 --> 01:44:00,494
Will the thing fit?

955
01:44:00,628 --> 01:44:03,965
It might need some slight alterations,
but it's madam's size.

956
01:44:04,966 --> 01:44:07,435
We'll have it for you to try on in a moment.

957
01:44:07,568 --> 01:44:10,438
- How long will the alterations take?
- Well...

958
01:44:10,504 --> 01:44:13,674
- May we have it by tonight?
- If it's absolutely necessary.

959
01:44:13,841 --> 01:44:17,144
Yes, it is. Now, we'd like to look
at a dinner dress...

960
01:44:17,244 --> 01:44:21,248
...short, black, with long sleeves
and a kind of square neck.

961
01:44:21,315 --> 01:44:23,284
- Scottie!
- My!

962
01:44:24,085 --> 01:44:27,555
You certainly do know what you want, sir.
I'll see what we have.

963
01:44:35,529 --> 01:44:38,566
- That's it. Do you have them in brown?
- Yes, we have.

964
01:44:38,632 --> 01:44:39,667
Fine.

965
01:44:47,475 --> 01:44:50,911
Here, Judy. Drink this straight down,
just like medicine.

966
01:44:51,746 --> 01:44:55,049
Why are you doing this?
What good will it do?

967
01:44:55,249 --> 01:44:56,684
I don't know.

968
01:44:57,118 --> 01:44:59,353
No good, I guess. I don't know.

969
01:45:02,923 --> 01:45:05,893
I wish you'd leave me alone.
I want to go away.

970
01:45:07,228 --> 01:45:08,796
You can, you know.

971
01:45:10,998 --> 01:45:12,967
No. You wouldn't let me.

972
01:45:15,302 --> 01:45:17,972
And I don't want to go.

973
01:45:19,039 --> 01:45:21,475
Judy, I tell you this.

974
01:45:21,642 --> 01:45:25,045
These past few days are
the first happy days I've had in a year.

975
01:45:25,713 --> 01:45:27,281
I know because...

976
01:45:28,482 --> 01:45:30,517
Because I remind you of her.

977
01:45:32,286 --> 01:45:34,388
And not even that very much.

978
01:45:34,688 --> 01:45:35,656
No.

979
01:45:36,523 --> 01:45:39,526
No, Judy. It's you, too.

980
01:45:40,261 --> 01:45:42,529
There's something in you that...

981
01:45:46,867 --> 01:45:49,737
- You don't even want to touch me.
- Yes, I do.

982
01:45:52,039 --> 01:45:55,275
Couldn't you like me,
just me, the way I am?

983
01:45:56,777 --> 01:46:00,280
When we first started out, it was so good.
We had fun.

984
01:46:02,650 --> 01:46:05,252
And then you started in on the clothes.

985
01:46:06,854 --> 01:46:09,456
I'll wear the darned clothes
if you want me to...

986
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:12,526
...if you'll just like me.

987
01:46:18,165 --> 01:46:19,967
The color of your hair.

988
01:46:25,773 --> 01:46:28,308
Judy, please. It can't matter to you.

989
01:46:38,786 --> 01:46:41,121
If I let you change me, will that do it?

990
01:46:41,688 --> 01:46:43,724
If I do what you tell me...

991
01:46:45,559 --> 01:46:46,994
...will you love me?

992
01:46:47,194 --> 01:46:48,195
Yes.

993
01:46:49,963 --> 01:46:51,465
- Yes.
- All right.

994
01:46:53,333 --> 01:46:57,004
All right, then, I'll do it.
I don't care anymore about me.

995
01:47:05,879 --> 01:47:08,148
Come on. We'll sit by the fire.

996
01:47:28,101 --> 01:47:30,170
I'm afraid it's going to take several hours.

997
01:47:30,203 --> 01:47:34,174
The young lady thought you'd like to go
home. She'll join you when she's finished.

998
01:47:34,274 --> 01:47:37,511
No. Tell her I'll go to her hotel
and wait for her there.

999
01:47:38,178 --> 01:47:41,381
- You're sure about the color of the hair?
- Yes, it's an easy color.

1000
01:47:41,481 --> 01:47:43,717
- All the rest of--
- Yes, we know what you want.

1001
01:47:43,784 --> 01:47:45,085
Thank you.

1002
01:49:24,918 --> 01:49:25,952
Well?

1003
01:49:26,052 --> 01:49:29,556
It should be back from your face
and pinned at the neck. I told her that.

1004
01:49:29,622 --> 01:49:30,623
I told you that.

1005
01:49:31,624 --> 01:49:34,661
We tried it. It just didn't seem to suit me.

1006
01:49:40,467 --> 01:49:41,835
Please, Judy.

1007
01:52:40,012 --> 01:52:42,615
- Where shall we go for dinner?
- Anywhere you like.

1008
01:52:42,681 --> 01:52:45,918
- Ernie's?
- You have a thing about Ernie's, don't you?

1009
01:52:46,852 --> 01:52:48,821
After all, it's our place.

1010
01:52:52,491 --> 01:52:54,360
Hello, my love. Like me?

1011
01:52:56,529 --> 01:52:59,165
- Is that the best you can do?
- Come here.

1012
01:52:59,532 --> 01:53:01,000
No. You'll muss me.

1013
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:03,769
That's what I had in mind. Come here.

1014
01:53:04,436 --> 01:53:06,505
It's too late. I got my face on.

1015
01:53:06,972 --> 01:53:08,474
I'm suddenly hungry.

1016
01:53:09,308 --> 01:53:12,578
- Would you rather go somewhere else?
- No. Ernie's is fine.

1017
01:53:15,714 --> 01:53:18,717
I'm gonna have one
of those big, beautiful steaks.

1018
01:53:19,485 --> 01:53:22,421
Let me see. To start I think I'll...

1019
01:53:24,189 --> 01:53:26,058
Help me with this, will you?

1020
01:53:28,928 --> 01:53:30,195
I have it.

1021
01:53:31,363 --> 01:53:34,199
- How do you work this thing?
- Can't you see?

1022
01:53:35,267 --> 01:53:38,804
- Now, there you are.
- Thank you. I'm just about ready.

1023
01:53:39,538 --> 01:53:41,840
All I've gotta do is find my lipstick.

1024
01:53:42,408 --> 01:53:44,543
Where did I put it? I had it a minute ago.

1025
01:53:57,322 --> 01:54:00,092
I wonder if it's here. Here it is.

1026
01:54:02,094 --> 01:54:03,529
There, I'm ready.

1027
01:54:05,931 --> 01:54:08,000
But first, muss me a little?

1028
01:54:11,437 --> 01:54:14,106
Scottie, I do have you now, don't I?

1029
01:54:17,009 --> 01:54:20,179
How would you like to go someplace
out of town for dinner?

1030
01:54:20,846 --> 01:54:24,583
- Maybe we could drive down the peninsula.
- All right. If you'd like.

1031
01:54:42,134 --> 01:54:43,869
We're going awfully far.

1032
01:54:43,936 --> 01:54:47,072
I just feel like driving.
Are you terribly hungry?

1033
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:49,641
No, it's all right.

1034
01:55:09,194 --> 01:55:10,862
Where are you going?

1035
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:17,502
One final thing I have to do...

1036
01:55:19,905 --> 01:55:22,140
...and then I'll be free of the past.

1037
01:55:41,326 --> 01:55:43,695
Scottie, why are we here?

1038
01:55:44,096 --> 01:55:45,430
I told you.

1039
01:55:47,666 --> 01:55:49,768
I have to go back into the past once more.

1040
01:55:49,835 --> 01:55:53,138
Just once more, for the last time.

1041
01:55:54,172 --> 01:55:55,607
Why? Why here?

1042
01:55:56,308 --> 01:55:58,276
Madeleine died here, Judy.

1043
01:56:00,278 --> 01:56:03,582
- I don't wanna go. I'd rather wait--
- No, I need you.

1044
01:56:03,815 --> 01:56:04,850
Why?

1045
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:08,420
I need you to be Madeleine for a while.

1046
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:11,690
And when it's done, we'll both be free.

1047
01:56:12,457 --> 01:56:15,694
- I'm scared.
- I have to tell you about Madeleine now.

1048
01:56:16,695 --> 01:56:18,063
Right there.

1049
01:56:19,197 --> 01:56:21,666
We stood there,
and I kissed her for the last time.

1050
01:56:21,766 --> 01:56:24,436
She said, "lf you lose me,
you'll know that I love you...

1051
01:56:24,569 --> 01:56:26,238
"...and wanted to keep loving you."

1052
01:56:26,338 --> 01:56:29,541
And I said, "I won't lose you." But I did.

1053
01:56:31,042 --> 01:56:32,577
And then she turned...

1054
01:56:34,379 --> 01:56:36,248
...and ran into the church.

1055
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:51,229
When I followed her, it was too late.

1056
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:57,235
I don't want to go in there!

1057
01:56:57,302 --> 01:56:58,737
It was too late.

1058
01:57:06,311 --> 01:57:09,914
I couldn't find her,
and then I heard footsteps on the stairs.

1059
01:57:10,515 --> 01:57:12,450
She was running up the tower.

1060
01:57:12,584 --> 01:57:13,885
Right here.

1061
01:57:14,586 --> 01:57:16,821
See? She was running up the stairs...

1062
01:57:17,088 --> 01:57:19,824
...and through the trapdoor
at the top of the tower.

1063
01:57:19,924 --> 01:57:22,827
I tried to follow her,
but I couldn't get to the top.

1064
01:57:22,961 --> 01:57:25,597
I tried, but I couldn't get to the top.

1065
01:57:25,697 --> 01:57:27,866
One doesn't often get a second chance.

1066
01:57:27,966 --> 01:57:30,068
I want to stop being haunted.

1067
01:57:30,668 --> 01:57:34,105
You're my second chance, Judy.
You're my second chance.

1068
01:57:34,205 --> 01:57:35,573
Take me away!

1069
01:57:35,874 --> 01:57:39,410
You look like Madeleine now.
Go up the stairs.

1070
01:57:39,444 --> 01:57:41,346
- No!
- Go up the stairs.

1071
01:57:44,015 --> 01:57:45,950
Go up the stairs, Judy...

1072
01:57:47,452 --> 01:57:48,987
...and I'll follow.

1073
01:58:46,277 --> 01:58:49,213
This was as far as I could get,
but you went on.

1074
01:58:50,648 --> 01:58:51,849
Remember?

1075
01:58:52,717 --> 01:58:55,720
The necklace, Madeleine.
That was the slip.

1076
01:58:56,454 --> 01:58:58,222
I remembered the necklace.

1077
01:58:58,356 --> 01:59:00,858
- Let me go!
- No. We're going up the tower, Madeleine.

1078
01:59:00,958 --> 01:59:02,693
You can't! You're afraid!

1079
01:59:03,394 --> 01:59:06,697
We'll see. We'll see.
This is my second chance.

1080
01:59:06,764 --> 01:59:07,832
Please!

1081
01:59:08,166 --> 01:59:10,701
You knew that day
that I couldn't follow you.

1082
01:59:10,835 --> 01:59:13,604
- Who was up there? Elster and his wife?
- Yes.

1083
01:59:13,704 --> 01:59:16,874
And she was the one who died.
The real wife, not you.

1084
01:59:17,208 --> 01:59:19,544
You were the counterfeit, weren't you?

1085
01:59:19,577 --> 01:59:22,346
- Was she dead or alive--
- Dead! He'd broken her neck.

1086
01:59:22,446 --> 01:59:25,416
He'd broken her neck.
Wasn't taking any chances, was he?

1087
01:59:25,483 --> 01:59:28,920
When you got up there, he pushed her off,
but it was you who screamed.

1088
01:59:28,986 --> 01:59:32,957
- Why did you scream?
- I wanted to stop it. I ran up to stop it--

1089
01:59:33,057 --> 01:59:37,228
Stop it? Why did you scream,
since you tricked me so well up to then?

1090
01:59:37,528 --> 01:59:41,332
You played the wife very well, Judy.
He made you over, didn't he?

1091
01:59:41,532 --> 01:59:44,669
He made you over just like
I made you over, only better.

1092
01:59:44,769 --> 01:59:49,106
Not only the clothes and the hair,
but the looks, the manner and the words...

1093
01:59:49,273 --> 01:59:51,042
...and those beautiful phony trances.

1094
01:59:51,175 --> 01:59:53,110
And you jumped into the Bay, didn't you?

1095
01:59:53,210 --> 01:59:55,980
I'll bet you're a wonderful swimmer,
aren't you?

1096
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:57,581
- Aren't you?
- Yes!

1097
01:59:58,015 --> 02:00:02,219
Then what did he do? Did he train you?
Did he rehearse you?

1098
02:00:02,486 --> 02:00:05,356
Did he tell you exactly what to do,
what to say?

1099
02:00:05,456 --> 02:00:08,192
You were a very apt pupil, too,
weren't you?

1100
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:11,996
Why did you pick on me? Why me?

1101
02:00:12,063 --> 02:00:13,531
Your accident!

1102
02:00:13,931 --> 02:00:15,399
The accident!

1103
02:00:16,067 --> 02:00:18,035
I was the setup, wasn't I?

1104
02:00:18,135 --> 02:00:20,271
I was a made-to-order witness.

1105
02:00:27,611 --> 02:00:28,946
I made it.

1106
02:00:30,681 --> 02:00:33,250
- I made it.
- What are you going to do?

1107
02:00:35,719 --> 02:00:38,456
We're going up and look
at the scene of the crime.

1108
02:00:38,589 --> 02:00:39,990
Come on, Judy.

1109
02:00:51,735 --> 02:00:53,604
This is where it happened.

1110
02:00:55,706 --> 02:00:58,375
The two of you hid there
and waited for it to clear...

1111
02:00:58,442 --> 02:01:01,745
...then you sneaked down
and drove into town, is that it?

1112
02:01:01,946 --> 02:01:04,415
And then? You were his girl?

1113
02:01:05,316 --> 02:01:07,017
What happened to you?

1114
02:01:07,585 --> 02:01:09,320
Did he ditch you?

1115
02:01:10,888 --> 02:01:12,656
With all of his wife's money...

1116
02:01:12,690 --> 02:01:16,460
...and all that freedom and power,
and he ditched you. What a shame.

1117
02:01:16,627 --> 02:01:19,196
But he knew he was safe.
He knew you couldn't talk.

1118
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:21,832
- Did he give you anything?
- Some money.

1119
02:01:22,166 --> 02:01:25,002
And the necklace, Carlotta's necklace.

1120
02:01:26,070 --> 02:01:28,572
There was where you made
your mistake, Judy.

1121
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:31,108
You shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing.

1122
02:01:35,546 --> 02:01:38,015
You shouldn't have been that sentimental.

1123
02:01:41,819 --> 02:01:43,754
I loved you so, Madeleine.

1124
02:01:47,958 --> 02:01:49,760
I was safe when you found me.

1125
02:01:49,827 --> 02:01:51,862
There was nothing that you could prove.

1126
02:01:51,929 --> 02:01:55,666
But when I saw you again,
I couldn't run away. I loved you so.

1127
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:58,402
I walked into danger
and let you change me...

1128
02:01:58,535 --> 02:02:00,838
...because I loved you and I wanted you.

1129
02:02:03,407 --> 02:02:05,576
Scottie, please. You loved me.

1130
02:02:06,276 --> 02:02:08,879
- Keep me safe. Please!
- It's too late.

1131
02:02:09,012 --> 02:02:11,582
It's too late. There's no bringing her back.

1132
02:02:11,682 --> 02:02:12,783
Please.

1133
02:02:24,695 --> 02:02:26,230
I heard voices.

1134
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,468
God have mercy.
