2
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:45,895
Good night, Pat.

3
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:47,158
Good night.

4
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,904
What happened to the old
bank? It was beautiful.

5
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:54,405
People kept robbing it.

6
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:57,274
That's a small price to pay for beauty.

7
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:04,521
Hit me.

8
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,089
Again.

9
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:14,398
Bust!

10
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:19,153
Give me credit, Mr. Macon?

11
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:22,292
You know my rules, Tom.

12
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:26,647
Well, it looks like you just about
cleaned everybody out, fella.

13
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:30,318
You haven't lost a hand
since you got the deal.

14
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:32,856
What's the secret of your success?

15
00:05:36,097 --> 00:05:36,860
Prayer.

16
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,630
Let's just you and me play.

17
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:57,922
Hit it.

18
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:04,431
Bust.

19
00:06:07,738 --> 00:06:11,004
Yeah, you're a hell of
a card player, fella.

20
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:15,043
I know, 'cause I'm a
hell of a card player,

21
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:18,513
and I can't even spot
how you're cheating.

22
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,597
The money stays, and you go.

23
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:38,871
Well, we seem to be

24
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,873
a little short on brotherly love

25
00:06:41,113 --> 00:06:42,080
around here.

26
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:44,876
If you're with him, you
better get out of here.

27
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:46,380
We're on our way.

28
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,882
I wasn't cheating.

29
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:48,884
Come on.

30
00:06:49,123 --> 00:06:50,385
I wasn't cheating!

31
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,890
You can die. You can both die.

32
00:06:53,128 --> 00:06:54,390
You hear that?

33
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,395
If he invites us to stay, then we'll go.

34
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,898
He's got to invite us to stick around.

35
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:02,367
He'll draw on you.

36
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:04,974
You don't know how fast he is.

37
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:15,818
I'm over the hill, but
it can happen to you.

38
00:07:16,057 --> 00:07:18,321
That's just what I want to hear.

39
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,825
Every day you get older. That's a law.

40
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,838
What would you think about

41
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:34,376
maybe asking us to stick around?

42
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:35,377
What?

43
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:37,845
You don't have to mean it or anything.

44
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,383
Just ask us to stick
around. I promise...

45
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:49,895
I can't help you, Sundance.

46
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,545
I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid

47
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,480
when I said you were cheating.

48
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,154
I draw on you, you'll kill me.

49
00:08:11,393 --> 00:08:13,692
There's that possibility.

50
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:16,328
You'd be killing yourself.

51
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:19,799
Why don't you just
invite us to stick around?

52
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,402
You can do it...

53
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:24,905
and easy.

54
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:27,135
Come on.

55
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:31,814
Come on.

56
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:34,822
Why don't you stick around?

57
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:38,026
Thanks, but we got to get going.

58
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:45,834
Hey, Kid.

59
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:48,699
Hey, Kid, how good are you?

60
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:02,218
Like I been telling you...

61
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,550
over the hill.

62
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:00,589
Boy, you know,

63
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:02,767
every time I see
Hole-In-The-Wall,

64
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:05,265
it's like seeing it for the first time.

65
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:08,302
Every time, I ask myself
the same question...

66
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,535
how can I be so damn
stupid to keep coming back?

67
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:20,784
What's your idea this time?

68
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:22,025
Bolivia.

69
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:25,558
What's Bolivia?

70
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:28,322
Bolivia... that's a country, stupid.

71
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:29,829
Central or South America.

72
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:31,934
One or the other.

73
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:33,968
Let's go to Mexico instead.

74
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:36,472
All they got in Mexico is sweat.

75
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,440
There's too much of that here.

76
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,446
If we'd been in business
during the California gold rush,

77
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:44,983
where would we have
gone? California, right?

78
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:47,690
When I say Bolivia, you
just think California.

79
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:50,156
You wouldn't believe
what they're finding

80
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:52,191
in the ground down there.

81
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,692
They're just falling into it.

82
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:56,197
Silver mines, gold mines, tin mines.

83
00:10:56,435 --> 00:11:00,202
Payrolls so heavy we'd strain
ourselves stealing them.

84
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:04,606
You just keep thinking, Butch.

85
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:06,610
That's what you're good at.

86
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:08,111
Boy, I got vision,

87
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:11,149
and the rest of the
world wears bifocals.

88
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:34,743
Hi, News. What you doing?

89
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:39,319
Aw, howdy, Butch. Uh, nothing.

90
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:40,819
Nothing.

91
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:42,219
Howdy, Sundance.

92
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,256
You sure are. You're
doing something. What?

93
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,264
<i>Just fixing to rob the
Union Pacific Flyer, Butch,</i>

94
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:53,473
like what we had in mind.

95
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:57,941
You fellas got everything
I told you all wrong.

96
00:11:58,146 --> 00:12:00,081
<i>Sure, we might hit the Flyer,</i>

97
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,046
but even if we do, it won't be this run.

98
00:12:03,286 --> 00:12:05,482
It'll be the next one, the return.

99
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:07,988
Sundance and me, we
been checking the banks.

100
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:09,123
No banks.

101
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:10,123
What?

102
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,728
<i>The Flyer, Butch.</i>

103
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,699
Fellas, bad as they are,
banks are better than trains.

104
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,702
They don't move. They stay put.

105
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:21,704
You know the money's in there.

106
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:23,434
When I left, I gave orders.

107
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:25,475
New orders been given.

108
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:27,478
I run things here, Harvey.

109
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:29,480
Used to you did.

110
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:31,153
Me now.

111
00:12:33,357 --> 00:12:34,552
This don't concern you.

112
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:39,264
You tell him to stay out.

113
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:41,991
Well, he goes his own way, like always.

114
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:44,032
What's the matter with you guys?

115
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:45,534
When I came here,

116
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,503
you were nothing. I formed you.

117
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:48,504
Who says?

118
00:12:48,743 --> 00:12:50,507
Read them a clipping, News.

119
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:51,508
Which one?

120
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:52,806
Any of them.

121
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:01,286
<i>This one here's from Salt Lake Herald.</i>

122
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:03,586
Butch Cassidy's
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang... ”

123
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:04,626
That's me!

124
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:07,162
You want Harvey to do your planning?

125
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,165
Want him to do your thinking for you?

126
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:12,168
You want him to run things?

127
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:14,068
Shut up now, News.

128
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:16,574
Not till I get to the good part.

129
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:19,077
Also known to have
participated in the holdup

130
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:21,613
are Flat Nose Curry and News Carver.

131
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:24,914
I just love to read my
name in the paper, Butch.

132
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,955
So we just forget
about Logan taking over,

133
00:13:28,194 --> 00:13:29,161
O.K., Flat Nose?

134
00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:30,657
You always said

135
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:32,832
that any one of us could challenge you.

136
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:35,331
'Cause I figured no one would do it.

137
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:36,797
Figured wrong, Butch.

138
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:38,996
You guys can't want Logan!

139
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:42,673
At least he's with us.

140
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:45,176
You been spending a lot of time gone.

141
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:47,179
Well, that's because
everything's different now.

142
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:48,680
Guns or knives, Butch?

143
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:51,184
You got to plan more, prepare more.

144
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,616
Guns or knives?

145
00:13:52,824 --> 00:13:53,553
Neither.

146
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:54,589
Pick!

147
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:57,888
I don't want to shoot with you, Harvey.

148
00:13:58,132 --> 00:14:00,293
Anything you say, Butch.

149
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:20,816
Maybe there's a way to
make a profit in this.

150
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,425
Bet on Logan.

151
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:25,427
I would, but who'd bet on you?

152
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,655
Sundance...

153
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:30,833
when we're done and he's dead,

154
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:33,166
you're welcome to stay.

155
00:14:33,442 --> 00:14:35,707
I don't mean to be a sore loser,

156
00:14:35,913 --> 00:14:38,575
but when it's done,
if I'm dead, kill him.

157
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:40,078
Love to.

158
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:50,892
No, no. Not yet.

159
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:52,724
Not until me and Harvey

160
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,492
get the rules straightened out.

161
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:56,897
Rules in a knife fight?

162
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:58,801
No rules.

163
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:01,272
If there ain't any
rules, let's get started.

164
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:03,207
Someone count 1, 2, 3, go.

165
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,208
1, 2, 3, go.

166
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,285
I was really rooting for you, Butch.

167
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:13,082
Well, thank you, Flat Nose.

168
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:16,490
That's what sustained
me in my time of trouble.

169
00:15:18,032 --> 00:15:20,296
<i>Hey, what's this about the Flyer?</i>

170
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:21,831
Harvey said we'd hit it

171
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:23,834
both this run and the return.

172
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:26,338
<i>Nobody's done that to the Flyer before.</i>

173
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:28,841
No matter how much we got at first,

174
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,105
they'd figure the return was safe

175
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:32,873
and load it up with money.

176
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:34,347
Harvey thought of that?

177
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:35,848
Yes, sir, he did.

178
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:37,852
I'll tell you something, fellas.

179
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:38,750
That's exactly what we're going to do.

180
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,272
Stop it.

181
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:20,170
Where?

182
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:22,676
Up ahead there.

183
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:24,848
Bet that's old Butch himself.

184
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:33,724
Hold it there.

185
00:16:35,463 --> 00:16:36,726
Just thought I'd watch.

186
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:39,230
Bring the kids, why don't you?

187
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:40,764
Stick your heads in.

188
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:44,271
You're just going to
get yourself blown up

189
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:46,305
you don't open that door.

190
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:49,309
I can't do that. I work
for Mr. E.H. Harriman

191
00:16:49,548 --> 00:16:51,311
of the Union Pacific Railroad. He...

192
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,314
Shut up about that E.H. Harriman stuff

193
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:54,315
and open up.

194
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:55,817
What's going on?

195
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:57,786
We got a patriot in there.

196
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,822
That's young Woodcock.
He's awful dedicated.

197
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:00,823
Woodcock?

198
00:17:00,996 --> 00:17:01,758
Yes, sir.

199
00:17:01,997 --> 00:17:03,966
You know who we are?

200
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,997
You're the Hole-In-The-Wall
Gang, Mr. Cassidy.

201
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:08,499
I understand that,

202
00:17:08,705 --> 00:17:12,506
but Mr. E.H. Harriman
himself give me this job.

203
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:14,540
I got to do my best.

204
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,044
Your best don't include
getting yourself killed.

205
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:18,214
Dynamite's ready.

206
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:20,578
Mr. E.H. Harriman himself
had the confidence...

207
00:17:20,787 --> 00:17:22,881
Open the door, or that's it.

208
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:24,386
You think E.H. Harriman

209
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:26,718
would get himself killed for you,

210
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:27,895
Woodcock?

211
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,395
I work for Mr. E.H. Harriman

212
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,429
of the Union Pacific Railroad,

213
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:34,068
and he entrusted me...

214
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:50,753
Hey, Woodcock.

215
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:52,756
Woodcock, you all right?

216
00:17:52,995 --> 00:17:54,257
Hey.

217
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,020
Hmm?

218
00:18:00,938 --> 00:18:03,532
Whatever Harriman's
paying you ain't enough.

219
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,685
There ain't what I'd call
a fortune in there, Butch.

220
00:18:15,924 --> 00:18:18,188
Well, just so we come out ahead.

221
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,291
That's the main thing.

222
00:18:20,162 --> 00:18:21,220
The
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang

223
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:22,386
The
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang

224
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:26,398
<i>just robbed the Flyer
right outside of our town,</i>

225
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,935
so that makes it our responsibility

226
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,507
to get out there and get after them.

227
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,041
You'll have to bring your own horses.

228
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,272
How many of you can bring your own guns?

229
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:44,585
How many of you will want
me to supply you with guns?

230
00:18:48,998 --> 00:18:49,966
Well... come on now.

231
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,261
I think it's up to us to
do something, don't you?

232
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:54,971
What's the point?

233
00:18:55,173 --> 00:18:56,265
They're probably halfway

234
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,975
to Hole-In-The-Wall
already.

235
00:18:58,177 --> 00:19:00,441
That's exactly why we have got to hurry.

236
00:19:00,713 --> 00:19:02,409
If we mount up right now

237
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:04,344
and get out there after them,

238
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:06,348
maybe we can head them off.

239
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:08,852
If we did that, they'd kill us.

240
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:12,824
We don't want to let
them get away with this.

241
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,362
Boy, I just eat this up with a spoon.

242
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:20,366
All right, youse two,
I want you at my party.

243
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:21,367
What party?

244
00:19:21,606 --> 00:19:23,369
I'm losing my piano player.

245
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,873
He's going off to fight the war.

246
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:27,603
What war?

247
00:19:27,848 --> 00:19:29,509
The war with the Spanish.

248
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,719
<i>Remember the Maine.</i>

249
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:33,215
Who can forget it?

250
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:36,083
I'm giving him a send-off. so come on.

251
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:46,369
Goodbye, Dolly

252
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:47,867
I must leave you...

253
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:49,869
When I was a kid,

254
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:52,771
I always thought I would grow up

255
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:54,173
to be a hero.

256
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:55,677
It's too late now.

257
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,385
Why'd you say something like that?

258
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,815
You didn't have to say
something like that.

259
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:02,820
You want me to go alone

260
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,324
and fight the
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang?

261
00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:06,858
That's fine with me.

262
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:09,829
If you want your kids
to know you let me,

263
00:20:10,068 --> 00:20:11,626
<i>that's fine with me,</i>

264
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,305
but I don't think that's what you want.

265
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,633
Is it?

266
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:23,713
Why don't we enlist,
go fight the Spanish?

267
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:25,715
You and me in the war.

268
00:20:25,954 --> 00:20:28,719
We got a lot of things going for us...

269
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,220
experience, maturity, leadership.

270
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:32,758
I'll bet we end up officers.

271
00:20:32,963 --> 00:20:34,988
I'd be Major Parker.

272
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:38,692
Parker?

273
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:40,769
Yeah. That's my real name.

274
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,105
Robert Leroy Parker.

275
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,606
No fooling?

276
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:46,904
No.

277
00:20:51,654 --> 00:20:52,643
Mine's Longbaugh.

278
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:54,321
No fooling.

279
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:55,888
Long what?

280
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:57,923
Harry Longbaugh.

281
00:20:58,161 --> 00:20:59,925
So you'd be Major Longbaugh.

282
00:21:00,164 --> 00:21:01,358
What do you say?

283
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,802
You just keep thinking, Butch.

284
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,804
That's what you're good at.

285
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:11,306
<i>But you're not frightened.</i>

286
00:21:11,578 --> 00:21:12,340
<i>No, sir.</i>

287
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:14,343
<i>You have got respect for me,</i>

288
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:16,812
<i>and I have got respect for you.</i>

289
00:21:17,018 --> 00:21:19,817
That's why you and you and you

290
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:21,854
are riding with me. Am I right?

291
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:26,462
Well, what do you say?

292
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:28,563
I say this.

293
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:32,532
I say, ladies and gentlemen,

294
00:21:32,772 --> 00:21:34,865
boys and girls, friends and enemies,

295
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:36,370
meet the future!

296
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,872
The future what?

297
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:39,875
The future mode of transportation

298
00:21:40,114 --> 00:21:42,140
for this weary Western world.

299
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:45,683
Now, I'm not going to make
a lot of extravagant claims.

300
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,653
Sure, it'll change your
whole life for the better,

301
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,154
but that's all.

302
00:21:50,427 --> 00:21:52,692
What the hell do you think you're doing?

303
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:54,193
You got the crowd together,

304
00:21:54,432 --> 00:21:56,697
so I thought I'd do a little selling.

305
00:21:56,936 --> 00:21:59,201
I'm trying to raise a posse here.

306
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:00,701
A short presentation.

307
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:02,135
The horse is dead.

308
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:03,969
This item sells itself.

309
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:07,478
<i>Are you going to listen
to him or come with me?</i>

310
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:10,480
Butch, Fanny says to come into her party

311
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,516
right now.

312
00:22:11,755 --> 00:22:15,021
<i>No oats, no mess, no kicks, no bites,</i>

313
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:17,523
<i>no running away, no
stepping on your foot.</i>

314
00:22:17,762 --> 00:22:20,527
Well, I think I'll get saddled up

315
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,394
and go looking for a woman.

316
00:22:23,636 --> 00:22:25,501
Good hunting.

317
00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:30,737
Shouldn't take more
than a couple of days.

318
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:36,414
I'm not picky...

319
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:39,884
as long as she's smart,

320
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:41,591
pretty...

321
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:43,157
sweet...

322
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,722
gentle, and...

323
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:50,060
tender and refined...

324
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:52,897
lovely...

325
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,606
carefree.

326
00:23:58,990 --> 00:23:59,888
Aah!

327
00:24:02,828 --> 00:24:04,820
Keep going, teacher lady.

328
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:15,167
It's O.K. Don't mind me. Keep on going.

329
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:44,745
Let down your hair.

330
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,454
Shake your head.

331
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:10,045
Do you know what I wish?

332
00:26:10,256 --> 00:26:13,020
That once you'd get here on time.

333
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:18,928
You are mine, Etta Place.

334
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,964
Mine.

335
00:26:21,203 --> 00:26:22,465
You hear me?

336
00:26:22,705 --> 00:26:24,036
Mine.

337
00:26:24,273 --> 00:26:26,071
All mine.

338
00:26:29,847 --> 00:26:32,749
Your soft white flesh is mine.

339
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:34,110
Soft...

340
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:35,819
white...

341
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:38,081
bwhaa!

342
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,462
Meet the future.

343
00:26:47,837 --> 00:26:50,101
Do you know what you're doing?

344
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:51,101
Theoretically.

345
00:26:51,341 --> 00:26:52,399
Aah!

346
00:26:52,642 --> 00:26:54,132
Don't ever hit your mother with a shovel

347
00:26:54,411 --> 00:26:57,643
It leaves a dull impression on her mind

348
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:04,451
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head

349
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,523
And just like the guy

350
00:27:07,762 --> 00:27:11,062
Whose feet are too big for his bed

351
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:13,029
Nothin' seems to fit

352
00:27:13,268 --> 00:27:17,365
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head

353
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,575
They keep fallin'

354
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:25,340
So I just did me some talkin' to the sun

355
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:30,750
And I said I didn't like
the way he got things done

356
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:32,788
Sleepin' on the job

357
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,929
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head

358
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,656
They keep fallin'

359
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:42,462
But there's one thing

360
00:27:42,705 --> 00:27:44,297
I know

361
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:48,411
The blues they sent to meet me

362
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:51,445
Won't defeat me

363
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:53,446
It won't be long

364
00:27:53,686 --> 00:27:55,415
Till happiness

365
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:58,819
Steps up to greet me

366
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:05,763
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head

367
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,695
But that doesn't mean

368
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:12,273
My eyes will soon be turnin' red

369
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:14,534
Cryin's not for me

370
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,546
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain

371
00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:20,843
By complainin'

372
00:28:21,087 --> 00:28:24,819
Because I'm free

373
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:28,086
Nothin's worryin' me

374
00:29:39,853 --> 00:29:42,220
Raindrops are fallin' on my head

375
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:45,458
But that doesn't mean

376
00:29:45,694 --> 00:29:48,994
My eyes will soon be turnin' red

377
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:51,099
Cryin's not for me

378
00:29:51,335 --> 00:29:55,602
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain

379
00:29:55,873 --> 00:29:57,933
By complainin'

380
00:29:58,143 --> 00:30:02,376
Because I'm free

381
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:08,749
Nothin's worryin' me

382
00:30:10,592 --> 00:30:12,857
<i>You've come to get him for the Flyer?</i>

383
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:14,859
Would you believe I'm broke already?

384
00:30:15,098 --> 00:30:17,363
Why is there never any money, Butch?

385
00:30:17,634 --> 00:30:19,397
I swear, Etta, I don't know.

386
00:30:19,636 --> 00:30:22,401
I've been working
like a dog all my life,

387
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,405
and I can't get a penny ahead.

388
00:30:25,644 --> 00:30:27,909
Sundance says it's
because you're a soft touch

389
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:29,878
and always taking expensive vacations,

390
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:31,380
buying drinks for everyone,

391
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:33,415
and you're a rotten gambler.

392
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:35,919
That might have something to do with it.

393
00:30:50,275 --> 00:30:51,038
Butch.

394
00:30:51,277 --> 00:30:52,073
Hmm?

395
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:54,542
Do you ever wonder if I'd met you first

396
00:30:54,815 --> 00:30:57,045
we'd been the ones to get involved?

397
00:30:57,251 --> 00:31:00,050
We are involved, Etta.
Don't you know that?

398
00:31:02,224 --> 00:31:03,987
You are riding on my bicycle.

399
00:31:04,226 --> 00:31:05,420
In some Arabian countries,

400
00:31:05,695 --> 00:31:07,458
that's the same as being married.

401
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,096
Hey.

402
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,466
What are you doing?

403
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,971
Stealing your woman.

404
00:31:21,582 --> 00:31:22,344
Take her.

405
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:23,811
Take her.

406
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,244
Well, you're a romantic bastard.

407
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:28,622
I'll give you that.

408
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:38,134
I'll give you that.

409
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:40,033
O.K., open up in there.

410
00:31:40,272 --> 00:31:42,536
I work for Mr. E.H. Harriman...

411
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:44,071
Hey, Woodcock!

412
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,539
Butch?

413
00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:46,710
You O.K.?

414
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,210
Uh, well, sort of.

415
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:51,181
Hey, that's wonderful.
Let's take a look at you.

416
00:31:52,654 --> 00:31:53,916
Well, now, Butch,

417
00:31:54,156 --> 00:31:56,421
you've got to have more respect for me

418
00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:59,424
than to think I'd fall
for a stunt like that.

419
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:05,034
You can't want to get blown up again?

420
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:08,002
Uh, Butch, you know if it were my money,

421
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:10,506
there's nobody I'd rather have steal it

422
00:32:10,777 --> 00:32:11,539
than you.

423
00:32:11,778 --> 00:32:13,541
But I'm still in the employ

424
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,043
of Mr. E.H. Harriman

425
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,013
of the Union Pacific Railroad.

426
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:18,481
Start this train!

427
00:32:18,754 --> 00:32:20,016
Get back inside, lady.

428
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,485
I'm not afraid of you.

429
00:32:21,758 --> 00:32:23,020
I'm not afraid of anything.

430
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,023
I'm a grandmother and a female,

431
00:32:25,263 --> 00:32:26,525
and I've got my rights.

432
00:32:26,764 --> 00:32:28,527
We got no time for this.

433
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:31,031
You can bull the others, but not me.

434
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,535
I've fought whiskey, and
I've fought gambling...

435
00:32:33,773 --> 00:32:35,934
We got no time for this.

436
00:32:36,176 --> 00:32:38,441
What are you doing? Let go!

437
00:32:38,712 --> 00:32:40,977
What are you going to do to her?

438
00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:42,445
Well, leave her alone.

439
00:32:42,717 --> 00:32:43,979
You're after the money,

440
00:32:44,187 --> 00:32:45,449
and the money's in here.

441
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:46,983
Please! All I want

442
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,954
is for somebody to start this train.

443
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:49,955
Somebody, please!

444
00:32:50,194 --> 00:32:51,456
Open the door, Woodcock,

445
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:52,991
or tell her goodbye.

446
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:55,495
Our Father, who art in heaven,

447
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:57,497
hallowed be Thy name,

448
00:32:57,736 --> 00:32:59,500
Thy kingdom come,

449
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:01,434
Thy will be done,

450
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:04,372
on earth as it is in heaven.

451
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:07,377
What am I going to
tell poor Mr. Harriman?

452
00:33:09,718 --> 00:33:12,483
Woodcock, what'd you have to go and do

453
00:33:12,755 --> 00:33:14,017
something like that for?

454
00:33:14,224 --> 00:33:16,819
Well, Butch, you blew
the last one so easy,

455
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,996
I just had to, um, do something.

456
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:21,995
Give me that and get some more,

457
00:33:22,235 --> 00:33:23,429
a lot more!

458
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:27,270
Well, that ought to do it.

459
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:50,398
Think you used enough
dynamite there, Butch?

460
00:33:53,674 --> 00:33:55,665
Ha ha ha ha.

461
00:34:45,707 --> 00:34:47,641
What the hell is that?

462
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:12,934
Whatever they're
selling, I don't want it.

463
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:25,146
Will you leave it?

464
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:31,859
Come on!

465
00:35:32,098 --> 00:35:33,030
Hyah!

466
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:52,318
Hey, Butch!

467
00:35:52,557 --> 00:35:53,455
What?

468
00:35:53,691 --> 00:35:54,920
They're very good!

469
00:35:57,496 --> 00:35:58,930
Split up!

470
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:13,846
How many of'em are following us?

471
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:15,346
All of'em.

472
00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:16,679
All of'em?

473
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:19,516
What's the matter with those guys?

474
00:36:19,758 --> 00:36:21,226
Hyah!

475
00:37:49,104 --> 00:37:52,438
I think we lost 'em. Do
you think we lost 'em?

476
00:37:52,676 --> 00:37:54,337
No.

477
00:37:54,578 --> 00:37:56,513
Neither do I. Hyah!

478
00:38:13,068 --> 00:38:15,230
Take our horses out back. Feed 'em good.

479
00:38:15,438 --> 00:38:16,200
Where's Sweetface?

480
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:17,701
Just inside. Trouble?

481
00:38:17,974 --> 00:38:18,737
Listen, you dirty old man,

482
00:38:18,976 --> 00:38:20,739
I know you're a lying thief

483
00:38:20,978 --> 00:38:22,241
and so do you,

484
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,744
but who'd know it to look at you?

485
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:26,246
Get yourself out front fast.

486
00:38:26,485 --> 00:38:27,747
You seen us ride through

487
00:38:27,987 --> 00:38:29,249
not five minutes ago.

488
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:30,751
Do this right,

489
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:32,754
I'll get you an old dog to kick.

490
00:38:32,993 --> 00:38:35,258
Here, room 9. Top of the stairs.

491
00:38:49,214 --> 00:38:51,478
Hey, you realize you're driving me crazy

492
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:53,480
staring out the window like that?

493
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,778
I swear, Sweetface can handle it, easy.

494
00:38:56,023 --> 00:38:57,786
He wouldn't dare louse me up.

495
00:38:58,025 --> 00:39:00,290
He's that scared of me.

496
00:39:05,534 --> 00:39:08,197
Hey, kid, how can I give Agnes

497
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:09,667
the concentration she deserves

498
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:12,704
with you staring out
the window like that?

499
00:39:12,943 --> 00:39:14,205
Butch, you're really something,

500
00:39:14,412 --> 00:39:15,812
you know that?

501
00:39:16,081 --> 00:39:18,379
Could you be a little more specific

502
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:19,710
about that, Agnes?

503
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:21,715
Butch!

504
00:39:28,463 --> 00:39:31,228
O.K., Sweetface, give them a nice smile.

505
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:32,729
Come on.

506
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:36,233
That's a nice touch.

507
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:38,237
<i>I swear, if he told me</i>

508
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,740
I rode out of town 10 minutes ago,

509
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,071
I'd believe him.

510
00:39:44,016 --> 00:39:45,678
And there they go.

511
00:39:54,496 --> 00:39:55,758
No, no.

512
00:39:56,031 --> 00:39:57,795
Don't ask me to stay.

513
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,309
You're the only real man I ever met.

514
00:40:08,547 --> 00:40:10,310
You know that, Butch?

515
00:40:10,549 --> 00:40:12,814
It's not just 'cause of all that money

516
00:40:13,053 --> 00:40:15,818
you got to spend on people. It's you.

517
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,352
The way you're always

518
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:19,823
looking to see am I happy or not?

519
00:40:20,095 --> 00:40:21,858
A lot of the other girls,

520
00:40:22,097 --> 00:40:23,861
they... they might want you

521
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,364
for when you got lots of money

522
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:27,332
to spend on people.

523
00:40:27,571 --> 00:40:30,335
Me, I... I don't care about...

524
00:40:30,574 --> 00:40:33,840
clothes and money and jewels...

525
00:40:35,114 --> 00:40:37,378
and furs,

526
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,414
and things like that.

527
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:41,917
Lots of the other girls do,

528
00:40:42,122 --> 00:40:43,385
but I never did.

529
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:45,922
I always said, Agnes... ”

530
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:06,586
Don't move.

531
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:07,810
Stand up.

532
00:41:08,055 --> 00:41:09,819
Put your hands up.

533
00:41:10,058 --> 00:41:10,990
Higher.

534
00:41:13,062 --> 00:41:14,825
Now turn around and start...

535
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,972
Get our horses and come on back here.

536
00:41:31,117 --> 00:41:31,880
Hyah!

537
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:34,212
Get out of here!

538
00:41:34,422 --> 00:41:35,286
Get out!

539
00:41:38,594 --> 00:41:39,857
Go on!

540
00:41:40,129 --> 00:41:42,393
Get out of here, you fat-headed beast!

541
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:44,998
Come on!

542
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,967
You're the fat-headed
beast. Quit shouting!

543
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:50,333
Boy, somebody sure trained 'em.

544
00:42:19,979 --> 00:42:20,947
Which way?

545
00:42:21,181 --> 00:42:23,081
Well, it doesn't matter.

546
00:42:23,317 --> 00:42:25,081
I don't know where we've been,

547
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,582
and I've just been there.

548
00:42:26,855 --> 00:42:28,448
They can't follow us. We're safe.

549
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:29,715
You really think so?

550
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:31,688
I will if you will.

551
00:43:01,165 --> 00:43:04,294
How long you
figure we've been watching?

552
00:43:04,536 --> 00:43:06,197
Oh, a while.

553
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:22,821
How long before you figure
they're not after us?

554
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,356
A while longer.

555
00:43:27,098 --> 00:43:29,089
How come you're so talkative?

556
00:43:30,936 --> 00:43:33,098
Just naturally blabby, I guess.

557
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:38,807
Ohh! I haven't done so much riding

558
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:40,341
since I quit rustling.

559
00:43:40,548 --> 00:43:42,311
That's a miserable occupation.

560
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:45,349
Dusk to dawn, no sleep, rotten food.

561
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,924
Hey.

562
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:53,460
I see it.

563
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,934
Torches you think?

564
00:44:00,173 --> 00:44:01,367
Yeah, maybe.

565
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:02,903
Maybe lanterns.

566
00:44:04,111 --> 00:44:05,806
They're following our path.

567
00:44:07,549 --> 00:44:09,779
Dead on it.

568
00:44:10,052 --> 00:44:12,317
I couldn't do that. Could you do that?

569
00:44:12,522 --> 00:44:14,285
How can they do that?

570
00:44:15,726 --> 00:44:17,353
Who are those guys?

571
00:44:29,911 --> 00:44:31,674
You sure this'll work?

572
00:44:31,913 --> 00:44:32,675
It'll work.

573
00:44:32,914 --> 00:44:34,678
That's what you said about Sweetface.

574
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:36,179
This'll work.

575
00:45:00,181 --> 00:45:01,877
Once they divide up,

576
00:45:02,118 --> 00:45:04,815
we take them, no trouble, right?

577
00:45:05,055 --> 00:45:06,283
Maybe.

578
00:45:06,523 --> 00:45:07,786
Boy, for a gunman,

579
00:45:08,025 --> 00:45:09,822
you're one hell of a pessimist.

580
00:45:11,062 --> 00:45:12,325
They ought to get

581
00:45:12,564 --> 00:45:17,161
to where we split up any time.

582
00:45:17,403 --> 00:45:19,132
They're just about there.

583
00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:25,840
How many of them do you
think will come our way?

584
00:45:26,081 --> 00:45:27,845
Oh, I wish we had rifles.

585
00:45:28,084 --> 00:45:29,745
I mean, they got rifles.

586
00:45:29,986 --> 00:45:32,251
But we got surprise on our side, right?

587
00:45:37,996 --> 00:45:40,488
So far, they're doing what we want.

588
00:45:45,005 --> 00:45:47,770
You think we ought to
take them from up here?

589
00:45:53,048 --> 00:45:55,813
Kid, look, you know this
work better than I do.

590
00:45:56,052 --> 00:45:57,315
Is it best here,

591
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,614
or maybe down there,
closer to the trail?

592
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:03,525
Uh...

593
00:46:05,831 --> 00:46:06,763
Damn it!

594
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:12,702
They're not going for it.

595
00:46:14,943 --> 00:46:16,969
Who are those guys?

596
00:46:17,213 --> 00:46:19,978
I don't know.

597
00:46:20,217 --> 00:46:21,206
I don't know.

598
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:23,716
We got to do something and shake them.

599
00:46:23,955 --> 00:46:25,718
Whatever you come up with

600
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,252
is fine with me,

601
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:29,723
but whatever it is, it better be now!

602
00:46:41,443 --> 00:46:43,207
What are you doing here?

603
00:46:43,479 --> 00:46:44,741
Easy, Ray. Easy.

604
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:47,746
What the hell do you mean, take it easy?

605
00:46:47,985 --> 00:46:50,146
You promised you'd never
come into my territory.

606
00:46:50,388 --> 00:46:51,150
And we haven't.

607
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:52,651
Just because we were friendly

608
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,155
doesn't give you the right to break in.

609
00:46:55,394 --> 00:46:56,861
What if we was seen together?

610
00:46:57,096 --> 00:46:59,861
I'm too old to find another job.

611
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,729
At least have the
decency to draw your guns.

612
00:47:03,004 --> 00:47:05,268
Listen, Butch is trying
to tell you something.

613
00:47:05,474 --> 00:47:07,738
All right. What do you want?

614
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:09,273
A couple of things.

615
00:47:09,479 --> 00:47:11,242
We want to enlist, Ray.

616
00:47:11,481 --> 00:47:13,177
In the army. Right away.

617
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:14,907
Go fight the Spanish.

618
00:47:20,225 --> 00:47:22,490
Oh, you're crazy. You are crazy.

619
00:47:22,728 --> 00:47:24,993
You are, both of you, crazy!

620
00:47:25,232 --> 00:47:29,499
They'd throw you in jail
for a thousand years each.

621
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:38,038
Come on, Sundance.
Start trussing my feet.

622
00:47:40,551 --> 00:47:42,815
Here. You seen these before. Come on!

623
00:47:43,087 --> 00:47:44,851
I'm not taking the chance

624
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:46,785
that someone saw you coming in.

625
00:47:47,025 --> 00:47:48,288
We're serious about this.

626
00:47:48,494 --> 00:47:49,756
You are known outlaws.

627
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:50,791
We'd quit.

628
00:47:51,031 --> 00:47:53,295
That's the point. Is that on tight?

629
00:47:53,534 --> 00:47:54,296
That's all right.

630
00:47:54,535 --> 00:47:56,299
There's some hankies in the drawer

631
00:47:56,538 --> 00:47:58,301
you can use to gag me.

632
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:00,008
I swear, this'd work, Ray.

633
00:48:00,242 --> 00:48:02,438
You trust us. The government trusts you.

634
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,704
Anything you tell them
they gotta believe, right?

635
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,713
You've never done a
dishonest thing ever,

636
00:48:07,952 --> 00:48:09,715
and you're pushing 60. We'd quit.

637
00:48:09,955 --> 00:48:11,718
They'd drop the charges against us,

638
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:13,721
we'd fight till the war is over.

639
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,190
They don't even have
to make us officers.

640
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:17,489
That's some proposition.

641
00:48:17,765 --> 00:48:19,392
They forget all about the years

642
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,692
of thieving and robbing.

643
00:48:20,968 --> 00:48:22,561
They take you into the army,

644
00:48:22,804 --> 00:48:26,832
which is what you want
in the first place.

645
00:48:27,076 --> 00:48:28,338
There's something out there

646
00:48:28,578 --> 00:48:30,570
that scares you, huh?

647
00:48:32,483 --> 00:48:33,746
But it's too late.

648
00:48:33,985 --> 00:48:35,748
You should've let yourself get killed

649
00:48:35,987 --> 00:48:37,717
while you had the chance.

650
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:41,256
You may be the biggest
thing to hit this area,

651
00:48:41,461 --> 00:48:43,725
but you're still two-bit outlaws.

652
00:48:43,997 --> 00:48:47,263
I never met a soul more
affable than you, Butch,

653
00:48:47,468 --> 00:48:48,731
or faster than the Kid.

654
00:48:49,004 --> 00:48:50,767
But you're still two-bit outlaws

655
00:48:51,006 --> 00:48:51,769
on the dodge.

656
00:48:52,008 --> 00:48:54,067
It's over! Don't you get that?

657
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,573
Your times is over,

658
00:48:55,813 --> 00:48:57,576
and you're gonna die bloody,

659
00:48:57,815 --> 00:49:00,751
and all you can do is choose where.

660
00:49:00,986 --> 00:49:01,680
I'm sorry,

661
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,515
I'm getting mean in my old age.

662
00:49:04,757 --> 00:49:06,156
Come on. Shut me up, Sundance.

663
00:51:27,371 --> 00:51:29,498
Ah, you're wasting your time.

664
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:32,005
They can't track us over rock.

665
00:51:32,277 --> 00:51:33,539
Tell them that.

666
00:51:59,878 --> 00:52:02,074
They're beginning to get on my nerves.

667
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:05,751
Who are those guys?

668
00:52:07,955 --> 00:52:09,218
You remember the time

669
00:52:09,424 --> 00:52:11,688
you, me, and Etta went to Denver

670
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,723
for a vacation?

671
00:52:12,962 --> 00:52:15,226
I'm glad you brought that up, Kid.

672
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:17,729
That's an important topic,
considering our situation.

673
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,731
The night we went gambling, remember?

674
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,734
We had dinner at the hotel.

675
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:24,238
Etta had roast beef, and I had chicken.

676
00:52:24,476 --> 00:52:26,239
If I can remember what you had,

677
00:52:26,478 --> 00:52:27,536
I'll die happy.

678
00:52:27,813 --> 00:52:28,576
Look out there.

679
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:30,112
What?

680
00:52:30,316 --> 00:52:32,842
I got to talking to
some gambler that night.

681
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,883
He told us about an Indian...

682
00:52:35,122 --> 00:52:36,090
full-blooded Indian,

683
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:37,849
except he used an English name,

684
00:52:38,126 --> 00:52:39,754
Sir... somebody.

685
00:52:39,996 --> 00:52:40,792
Lord Baltimore?

686
00:52:41,064 --> 00:52:43,829
That's right, and he could track anybody

687
00:52:44,068 --> 00:52:45,933
over anything day or night.

688
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:47,934
So?

689
00:52:48,173 --> 00:52:51,200
The guy on the ground, I think it's him.

690
00:52:56,683 --> 00:52:58,447
No. Baltimore works out of Oklahoma.

691
00:52:58,686 --> 00:53:00,153
He's strictly an Oklahoma man.

692
00:53:00,388 --> 00:53:02,584
I don't know where we are,

693
00:53:02,858 --> 00:53:04,120
but it isn't Oklahoma.

694
00:53:04,326 --> 00:53:06,022
Ah, it couldn't be him.

695
00:53:11,302 --> 00:53:12,701
It couldn't be him.

696
00:53:14,573 --> 00:53:15,562
I guess.

697
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,373
Whoever it is,

698
00:53:19,579 --> 00:53:22,242
it sure the hell is somebody.

699
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,280
Damn it!

700
00:53:53,488 --> 00:53:56,754
Don't they get tired?
Don't they get hungry?

701
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:58,288
They've gotta be.

702
00:53:58,528 --> 00:53:59,996
Why don't they slow up?

703
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:01,629
They could even go faster.

704
00:54:01,865 --> 00:54:03,731
At least that'd be a change.

705
00:54:03,968 --> 00:54:05,663
They don't even break formation.

706
00:54:05,904 --> 00:54:06,667
Do something!

707
00:54:41,416 --> 00:54:42,906
Kid.

708
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:44,779
What?

709
00:54:45,054 --> 00:54:46,419
Who's the best lawman?

710
00:54:48,558 --> 00:54:49,354
Best? How?

711
00:54:49,593 --> 00:54:52,586
You mean toughest or easiest to bribe?

712
00:54:52,864 --> 00:54:54,957
Toughest.

713
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:57,964
Joe LeFors.

714
00:54:58,203 --> 00:54:59,967
Gotta be.

715
00:55:04,245 --> 00:55:06,440
LeFors never leaves Wyoming. Never.

716
00:55:06,647 --> 00:55:08,377
You know that.

717
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,413
He always wears a white skimmer.

718
00:55:10,652 --> 00:55:12,746
That's how you tell it's Joe LeFors,

719
00:55:12,989 --> 00:55:16,084
'cause he wears a white straw hat.

720
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:19,854
Look at that guy out front.

721
00:55:39,055 --> 00:55:41,285
Jesus, who are those guys?

722
00:55:46,398 --> 00:55:47,160
Hyah!

723
00:55:47,399 --> 00:55:48,957
Come on now.

724
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:50,725
Here you go, Kid.

725
00:56:35,026 --> 00:56:37,290
Go on! Get out of here! Go on!

726
00:56:38,864 --> 00:56:40,957
What if they don't follow the horse?

727
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,361
You're the brains, Butch.

728
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:44,662
You'll think of something.

729
00:58:11,681 --> 00:58:12,875
Damn it!

730
00:58:27,501 --> 00:58:28,764
The way I figure it,

731
00:58:29,003 --> 00:58:30,732
we can either fight or give.

732
00:58:30,972 --> 00:58:32,736
If we give, we go to jail.

733
00:58:32,975 --> 00:58:34,101
I've been there already.

734
00:58:34,343 --> 00:58:35,435
If we fight,

735
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:37,111
they can stay where they are

736
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,507
and starve us out...

737
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:40,808
or go for position, shoot us.

738
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:43,178
Might even get a rock slide started.

739
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:44,855
What else can they do?

740
00:58:45,123 --> 00:58:46,590
They could surrender to us,

741
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:49,056
but I wouldn't count on that.

742
00:58:49,328 --> 00:58:51,023
They're going for position, all right.

743
00:58:51,265 --> 00:58:54,132
Better get ready.

744
00:58:57,438 --> 00:58:59,202
Kid, the next time I say

745
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:01,204
let's go someplace like Bolivia,

746
00:59:01,443 --> 00:59:02,638
let's go someplace like Bolivia.

747
00:59:02,879 --> 00:59:04,005
Next time.

748
00:59:05,982 --> 00:59:06,972
Ready?

749
00:59:09,287 --> 00:59:10,585
No. We'll jump.

750
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:16,951
Like hell we will.

751
00:59:17,197 --> 00:59:18,460
No. It'll be O.K.

752
00:59:18,699 --> 00:59:20,166
if the water's deep enough

753
00:59:20,401 --> 00:59:22,199
and we don't get squished to death.

754
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:23,597
They'll never follow us.

755
00:59:23,872 --> 00:59:24,930
How do you know?

756
00:59:25,173 --> 00:59:27,438
Would you jump that
if you didn't have to?

757
00:59:27,643 --> 00:59:29,407
I have to, and I'm not gonna.

758
00:59:29,646 --> 00:59:31,409
We got to. Otherwise we're dead.

759
00:59:31,648 --> 00:59:32,444
Come on.

760
00:59:32,683 --> 00:59:34,914
Just one clear shot...
that's all I want.

761
00:59:35,186 --> 00:59:36,950
I want to fight them!

762
00:59:37,189 --> 00:59:38,451
They'll kill us.

763
00:59:38,691 --> 00:59:39,453
Maybe.

764
00:59:39,692 --> 00:59:40,955
You want to die?

765
00:59:41,194 --> 00:59:43,321
Do you?

766
00:59:43,563 --> 00:59:45,657
All right, I'll jump first.

767
00:59:45,933 --> 00:59:46,695
No.

768
00:59:46,934 --> 00:59:48,197
Then you jump first.

769
00:59:48,403 --> 00:59:49,165
No, I said.

770
00:59:49,404 --> 00:59:50,200
What's the matter?

771
00:59:50,472 --> 00:59:51,940
I can't swim!

772
01:00:02,087 --> 01:00:03,350
Why, you crazy?

773
01:00:03,589 --> 01:00:05,853
The fall will probably kill you.

774
01:00:15,204 --> 01:00:16,865
Oh-oh...

775
01:00:17,106 --> 01:00:19,132
ohhh...

776
01:00:19,376 --> 01:00:21,867
shiiiit!

777
01:00:29,354 --> 01:00:30,515
Hang on to me.

778
01:00:30,723 --> 01:00:31,747
You're drowning me!

779
01:00:32,025 --> 01:00:33,721
I can't help it. I can't swim.

780
01:00:33,961 --> 01:00:35,223
You're choking me!

781
01:00:35,462 --> 01:00:36,724
I can't swim!

782
01:00:36,964 --> 01:00:38,057
I'm telling you, if I drown,

783
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,791
I swear to God I'll kill you.

784
01:00:41,036 --> 01:00:43,164
Never said I was a great swimmer.

785
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:48,974
Oh! You're choking me!

786
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:51,807
Oh! I'm choking!

787
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:53,346
Let go of me.

788
01:00:53,552 --> 01:00:55,850
I'm choking!

789
01:00:56,121 --> 01:00:57,089
Let go of my throat.

790
01:01:25,525 --> 01:01:27,323
The papers said they had you.

791
01:01:27,562 --> 01:01:30,589
Was it LeFors? Did they say?

792
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:32,266
Joe LeFors?

793
01:01:32,534 --> 01:01:33,796
I think so.

794
01:01:34,036 --> 01:01:35,299
And their tracker?

795
01:01:35,538 --> 01:01:36,300
Tracker?

796
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:37,801
Was it Lord Baltimore?

797
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:39,304
I think so.

798
01:01:39,543 --> 01:01:40,805
The paper's inside.

799
01:01:47,754 --> 01:01:50,019
You got enough to feed us?

800
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,850
Don't you know I do?

801
01:01:53,093 --> 01:01:54,652
They said you were dead.

802
01:01:54,863 --> 01:01:57,628
Don't make a big thing out of it.

803
01:02:00,336 --> 01:02:03,033
No. Make a big thing out of it.

804
01:02:07,745 --> 01:02:09,509
Hey.

805
01:02:09,748 --> 01:02:12,912
It was Baltimore and LeFors.

806
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:22,663
You know who else?

807
01:02:22,898 --> 01:02:23,695
Who?

808
01:02:23,966 --> 01:02:25,228
Jeff Carr, George Hiatt...

809
01:02:25,435 --> 01:02:26,197
Hiatt?

810
01:02:26,436 --> 01:02:27,699
T.T. Kelliher.

811
01:02:31,709 --> 01:02:34,041
We lucked out getting away.

812
01:02:34,312 --> 01:02:35,439
You know that?

813
01:02:37,616 --> 01:02:38,982
Why would these guys join up

814
01:02:39,219 --> 01:02:40,584
and take after us, though?

815
01:02:40,787 --> 01:02:42,551
Forget it. Bunch like that

816
01:02:42,824 --> 01:02:43,984
won't stay together long.

817
01:02:44,225 --> 01:02:44,987
They will...

818
01:02:45,226 --> 01:02:47,422
if Mr. Harriman has his way.

819
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:48,425
Who?

820
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:49,562
Mr. E.H. Harriman

821
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:50,993
of the Union Pacific Railroad.

822
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:53,999
He resents the way you've
been picking on him,

823
01:02:54,238 --> 01:02:56,001
so he's outfitted a special train

824
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:58,037
and hired special employees.

825
01:02:58,276 --> 01:03:00,039
You've been avoiding them for two days.

826
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:01,541
It's really sort of flattering

827
01:03:01,681 --> 01:03:03,945
if you want to think about it that way.

828
01:03:04,217 --> 01:03:05,981
A setup like that costs more

829
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:07,482
than we ever took.

830
01:03:07,688 --> 01:03:08,950
Apparently he can afford it.

831
01:03:11,693 --> 01:03:13,127
That crazy Harriman.

832
01:03:15,731 --> 01:03:16,994
That's bad business.

833
01:03:17,234 --> 01:03:18,428
How long do you think

834
01:03:18,668 --> 01:03:19,930
I'd stay in operation

835
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:21,934
if every job cost me money?

836
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,438
If he'd just pay me what he's spending

837
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:26,439
to make me stop robbing him,

838
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:27,940
I'd stop robbing him.

839
01:03:30,683 --> 01:03:33,448
You probably inherited
every penny you got!

840
01:03:33,687 --> 01:03:34,449
Inherited guys,

841
01:03:34,688 --> 01:03:36,452
what the hell do they know?

842
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:38,784
You say they were hired permanent?

843
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,825
No. Just till they kill you.

844
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:54,338
That means they're
still after us, Butch,

845
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,708
and it's going to be the same thing

846
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:58,178
all over again.

847
01:04:02,224 --> 01:04:03,987
They'll show up here...

848
01:04:04,226 --> 01:04:05,488
sooner or later.

849
01:04:22,683 --> 01:04:23,445
Hey, Etta.

850
01:04:25,186 --> 01:04:26,949
I'll get you some more.

851
01:04:27,188 --> 01:04:30,454
Butch and me have been
talking it all over.

852
01:04:30,693 --> 01:04:32,456
Wherever the hell Bolivia is,

853
01:04:32,696 --> 01:04:34,459
that's where we're off to.

854
01:04:34,698 --> 01:04:36,963
We'll go down there and play it safe,

855
01:04:37,234 --> 01:04:39,498
maybe keep our hand in a little bit.

856
01:04:39,704 --> 01:04:40,967
Butch speaks some Spanish.

857
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:43,503
I can wrestle with a menu O.K.

858
01:04:43,709 --> 01:04:45,473
And you speak it good.

859
01:04:47,246 --> 01:04:50,512
And it'd be good cover
going with a woman.

860
01:04:50,718 --> 01:04:52,482
No one expects it.

861
01:04:54,255 --> 01:04:56,019
Then we could travel safer.

862
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,022
What I'm saying is,

863
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,524
if you want to go,

864
01:05:00,764 --> 01:05:01,958
I won't stop you,

865
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,963
but the minute you start to whine

866
01:05:04,202 --> 01:05:05,464
or make a nuisance,

867
01:05:05,703 --> 01:05:07,467
I don't care where we are,

868
01:05:07,706 --> 01:05:08,968
I'm dumping you flat.

869
01:05:09,241 --> 01:05:11,005
Don't sugarcoat it like that, Kid.

870
01:05:11,244 --> 01:05:12,506
Tell her straight.

871
01:05:18,253 --> 01:05:19,948
I'm 26, and I'm single

872
01:05:20,188 --> 01:05:21,450
and a schoolteacher,

873
01:05:21,657 --> 01:05:24,422
and that's the bottom of the pit.

874
01:05:24,694 --> 01:05:26,458
And the only excitement I've known

875
01:05:26,697 --> 01:05:27,959
is here with me now.

876
01:05:28,198 --> 01:05:29,461
So I'll go with you,

877
01:05:29,701 --> 01:05:30,963
and I won't whine,

878
01:05:31,202 --> 01:05:32,464
and I'll sew your socks,

879
01:05:32,704 --> 01:05:34,969
and I'll stitch you when you're wounded,

880
01:05:35,207 --> 01:05:37,472
and I'll do anything you ask of me

881
01:05:37,711 --> 01:05:38,973
except one thing.

882
01:05:39,212 --> 01:05:40,976
I won't watch you die.

883
01:05:41,249 --> 01:05:42,511
I'll miss that scene,

884
01:05:42,717 --> 01:05:43,979
if you don't mind.

885
01:06:18,261 --> 01:06:19,456
The future's all yours,

886
01:06:19,664 --> 01:06:21,427
you lousy bicycles.

887
01:11:26,151 --> 01:11:28,915
Well, you know, it could be worse.

888
01:11:29,154 --> 01:11:32,613
You get a lot more for
your money in Bolivia.

889
01:11:32,859 --> 01:11:34,122
I checked on it.

890
01:11:34,361 --> 01:11:35,623
What could they have here

891
01:11:35,863 --> 01:11:38,924
that you could possibly want to buy?

892
01:11:43,205 --> 01:11:45,470
Jeez, all Bolivia can't look like this.

893
01:11:45,675 --> 01:11:47,108
How do you know?

894
01:11:47,377 --> 01:11:49,471
This might be the garden spot

895
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,942
of the whole country.

896
01:11:51,215 --> 01:11:52,979
People may travel hundreds of miles

897
01:11:53,218 --> 01:11:54,981
just to get to this spot

898
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:56,312
where we're standing now.

899
01:11:56,556 --> 01:11:58,319
This might be the
Atlantic City, New Jersey,

900
01:11:58,558 --> 01:12:00,322
of all Bolivia for all you know.

901
01:12:00,561 --> 01:12:01,823
I know more about Bolivia

902
01:12:01,962 --> 01:12:03,725
than you know about
Atlantic City, New Jersey,

903
01:12:03,964 --> 01:12:05,125
I can tell you that.

904
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,425
Aha!

905
01:12:07,669 --> 01:12:09,934
You do, huh?

906
01:12:10,173 --> 01:12:11,937
I was born there.

907
01:12:12,176 --> 01:12:14,440
I was born in New Jersey...

908
01:12:14,678 --> 01:12:16,476
brought up there, so...

909
01:12:16,714 --> 01:12:18,045
I didn't know that.

910
01:12:18,316 --> 01:12:20,478
The total tonnage of what you don't know

911
01:12:20,686 --> 01:12:21,948
is enough to shatter...

912
01:12:22,221 --> 01:12:23,211
We're not accomplishing

913
01:12:23,456 --> 01:12:24,480
as much as we might.

914
01:12:24,691 --> 01:12:26,956
Listen, your job is to back me up,

915
01:12:27,228 --> 01:12:28,752
because you'd starve without me.

916
01:12:30,398 --> 01:12:32,492
And you, your job is to shut up.

917
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,503
He'll feel a lot better

918
01:12:38,742 --> 01:12:41,006
after he's robbed a couple of banks.

919
01:12:42,414 --> 01:12:44,507
Ha ha ha ha!

920
01:12:46,752 --> 01:12:48,014
Bolivia.

921
01:12:57,766 --> 01:12:59,028
Hell, it's just a bank

922
01:12:59,301 --> 01:13:00,563
like any other bank.

923
01:13:00,769 --> 01:13:02,465
You got to move in slowly,

924
01:13:02,706 --> 01:13:03,968
check out everything.

925
01:13:04,241 --> 01:13:05,504
The thing to remember...

926
01:13:05,743 --> 01:13:08,007
Don't tell me how to rob a bank.

927
01:13:08,246 --> 01:13:10,511
I know how to rob a bank.

928
01:13:10,749 --> 01:13:13,014
A few dark clouds
appear on your horizon,

929
01:13:13,253 --> 01:13:16,017
and you just go all
to pieces, don't you?

930
01:13:35,714 --> 01:13:36,976
<i>Buenos días, señores.</i>

931
01:13:37,249 --> 01:13:38,580
<i>¿Les puedo servir en algo?</i>

932
01:13:38,784 --> 01:13:41,481
<i>Ordenen para atenderlos
por favor inmediatamente.</i>

933
01:13:43,758 --> 01:13:45,521
<i>¿Quieren hacer algún depósito?</i>

934
01:13:47,763 --> 01:13:49,025
<i>¿Quieren abrir una cuenta?</i>

935
01:13:49,264 --> 01:13:51,529
<i>Bien, el cajero los
atienda inmediatamente.</i>

936
01:13:51,768 --> 01:13:53,531
<i>Los atendemos por todo.</i>

937
01:13:59,778 --> 01:14:01,040
<i>Señor?</i>

938
01:14:12,527 --> 01:14:13,517
<i>Adiós.</i>

939
01:14:15,197 --> 01:14:16,995
This is a robbery.

940
01:14:17,267 --> 01:14:19,462
<i>Esto es un robo.</i>

941
01:14:19,703 --> 01:14:22,468
<i>Esto es un robo.</i>

942
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,978
This is supposed to
be a unison recitation.

943
01:14:30,249 --> 01:14:32,514
Why do I have to do any of this?

944
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:33,982
He's the one

945
01:14:34,254 --> 01:14:36,018
who claimed he knew the language.

946
01:14:36,257 --> 01:14:38,020
Your line of work requires
a specialized vocabulary.

947
01:14:38,259 --> 01:14:40,751
I got nervous. I forgot
the words. Shoot me.

948
01:14:40,963 --> 01:14:42,863
You've had worse ideas lately.

949
01:14:43,099 --> 01:14:44,499
Raise your hands.

950
01:14:46,269 --> 01:14:48,534
<i>Uh... las manos arriba.</i>

951
01:14:48,773 --> 01:14:50,035
Raise them.

952
01:14:51,777 --> 01:14:53,039
<i>Arriba.</i>

953
01:14:53,278 --> 01:14:56,043
All of you back against the wall.

954
01:14:56,282 --> 01:15:00,549
<i>Todos ustedes, um...</i>

955
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:03,986
<i>arrísmense a la pared.</i>

956
01:15:04,259 --> 01:15:06,022
Give me the money.

957
01:15:11,735 --> 01:15:14,227
Give me the money.

958
01:15:14,506 --> 01:15:16,531
Give me the money.

959
01:15:16,741 --> 01:15:18,437
This is not going to work,

960
01:15:18,711 --> 01:15:20,975
and we're going to be up all night

961
01:15:21,213 --> 01:15:22,476
until you get this.

962
01:15:22,716 --> 01:15:24,479
Now give me the money.

963
01:15:28,222 --> 01:15:30,487
It's on the tip of my tongue, Etta.

964
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:31,988
I swear it.

965
01:15:34,264 --> 01:15:36,597
Butch, are you still thinking in there?

966
01:15:36,801 --> 01:15:39,599
What the hell else is there to do?

967
01:15:39,837 --> 01:15:41,999
Try this one.

968
01:15:42,274 --> 01:15:44,743
Where is the safe? Open it.

969
01:15:44,944 --> 01:15:46,502
<i>Dónde es...</i>

970
01:15:50,784 --> 01:15:53,049
Uh, that's a hard one.

971
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:58,282
<i>¿Dónde está la caja? ¡Ábrala!</i>

972
01:15:58,527 --> 01:16:01,122
That's very good, Butch.

973
01:16:01,364 --> 01:16:03,492
You're a good teacher. Etta.

974
01:16:05,303 --> 01:16:06,565
<i>¡Esto es un robo!</i>

975
01:16:12,679 --> 01:16:14,978
<i>Manos a...</i>

976
01:16:15,249 --> 01:16:16,978
<i>Manos, um...</i>

977
01:16:24,026 --> 01:16:25,721
<i>¡Manos arriba!</i>

978
01:16:25,963 --> 01:16:27,590
They got them up! Skip down!

979
01:16:27,865 --> 01:16:29,298
<i>- ¡Arriba!
- Skip on down!</i>

980
01:16:29,533 --> 01:16:32,833
<i>Todos ustedes arrísmense a la pared.</i>

981
01:16:33,037 --> 01:16:34,938
They're against the wall already!

982
01:16:35,207 --> 01:16:35,969
<i>Dónde es...</i>

983
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:37,471
Oh, you're so damn smart,

984
01:16:37,711 --> 01:16:39,008
you read it.

985
01:16:47,923 --> 01:16:49,186
A goddamn crib sheet.

986
01:16:49,459 --> 01:16:50,721
You almost blew it.

987
01:16:50,927 --> 01:16:52,189
You sure didn't help much.

988
01:16:52,463 --> 01:16:55,227
You can't do anything
without a crib sheet.

989
01:17:10,785 --> 01:17:13,516
For God's sake, don't drop the money!

990
01:17:13,756 --> 01:17:15,554
I won't drop the money!

991
01:17:15,792 --> 01:17:17,020
<i>Voy a traer el comisario.</i>

992
01:17:17,294 --> 01:17:18,352
<i>Sí, vamos.</i>

993
01:17:18,562 --> 01:17:19,257
<i>Ay, nombre.</i>

994
01:17:19,497 --> 01:17:20,259
<i>Evarista.</i>

995
01:17:20,498 --> 01:17:21,465
<i>¿Evarista qué?</i>

996
01:17:21,699 --> 01:17:22,792
<i>Señor comandante,</i>

997
01:17:23,035 --> 01:17:25,469
<i>dos hombres acometen y asaltan el banco.</i>

998
01:17:25,704 --> 01:17:27,297
<i>Dos yanquis y una muchacha</i>

999
01:17:27,574 --> 01:17:29,166
<i>se fueron por la cañada.</i>

1000
01:17:29,409 --> 01:17:31,503
<i>Se llevaron mi pistola y todo el dinero.</i>

1001
01:17:31,745 --> 01:17:32,507
<i>Vámanos!</i>

1002
01:17:32,746 --> 01:17:33,508
<i>A caballos!</i>

1003
01:18:26,114 --> 01:18:27,742
Isn't that a pretty sight?

1004
01:18:30,819 --> 01:18:32,981
Well, we're back in
business, boys and girls,

1005
01:18:33,256 --> 01:18:34,518
just like the old days.

1006
01:23:02,363 --> 01:23:04,024
Let's stay here and get him

1007
01:23:04,265 --> 01:23:05,527
and be done with it.

1008
01:23:05,734 --> 01:23:06,996
But what if we lose?

1009
01:23:07,268 --> 01:23:09,032
We saw him with two guys.

1010
01:23:09,271 --> 01:23:10,533
What if he's got 20?

1011
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:13,005
You don't know for sure it's LeFors.

1012
01:23:13,276 --> 01:23:15,039
I'm a hell of a guesser.

1013
01:23:15,278 --> 01:23:17,042
He can't arrest you.
It's a foreign country.

1014
01:23:17,281 --> 01:23:18,475
He can't take you back.

1015
01:23:18,716 --> 01:23:20,480
He's not going to take anybody back.

1016
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,482
He's going to wait for us

1017
01:23:22,721 --> 01:23:23,984
to pull another job

1018
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:25,452
and then hunt us down.

1019
01:23:25,725 --> 01:23:26,988
Let's finish it now, Butch,

1020
01:23:27,194 --> 01:23:28,456
one way or the other.

1021
01:23:30,231 --> 01:23:31,995
He's got to wait for us

1022
01:23:32,234 --> 01:23:33,496
to pull another job.

1023
01:23:35,238 --> 01:23:37,502
Well, what if there isn't another job?

1024
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,003
He can't arrest us,

1025
01:23:39,243 --> 01:23:41,507
and he can't take us out of here.

1026
01:23:41,745 --> 01:23:43,008
We'll drive him crazy.

1027
01:23:43,248 --> 01:23:44,510
We'll outlast the bastard.

1028
01:23:44,749 --> 01:23:45,841
We'll go straight.

1029
01:23:46,085 --> 01:23:48,019
So you want jobs.

1030
01:23:48,254 --> 01:23:51,019
You're from the U.S. of A.,

1031
01:23:51,258 --> 01:23:53,522
and you are seeking after employment.

1032
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:55,558
Well, you couldn't have picked

1033
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:58,062
a more out of the way place

1034
01:23:58,267 --> 01:23:59,529
in all of Bolivia,

1035
01:23:59,802 --> 01:24:01,064
I'll tell you that.

1036
01:24:01,271 --> 01:24:02,966
<i>Gracias, Jesús.</i>

1037
01:24:03,273 --> 01:24:06,038
Ordinarily you've got to wait

1038
01:24:06,277 --> 01:24:08,040
to work for Percy Garrison,

1039
01:24:08,279 --> 01:24:10,043
but this ain't ordinarily.

1040
01:24:10,282 --> 01:24:11,044
Bingo.

1041
01:24:11,283 --> 01:24:13,047
You mean there are jobs.

1042
01:24:13,286 --> 01:24:14,548
Yes, there are jobs.

1043
01:24:14,754 --> 01:24:16,016
There are lots of jobs.

1044
01:24:16,289 --> 01:24:18,053
Don't you want to know why?

1045
01:24:18,292 --> 01:24:19,190
Yeah, why?

1046
01:24:20,528 --> 01:24:21,995
Damn it.

1047
01:24:22,197 --> 01:24:25,463
Because I cannot promise to pay you.

1048
01:24:25,734 --> 01:24:27,828
Don't you want to know why?

1049
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:30,471
O.K., why?

1050
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:34,974
On account of the payroll thieves,

1051
01:24:35,213 --> 01:24:36,476
fellow citizens.

1052
01:24:36,748 --> 01:24:38,511
You see, every mine around

1053
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:40,514
gets its payroll

1054
01:24:40,753 --> 01:24:42,015
from La Paz.

1055
01:24:42,255 --> 01:24:43,518
And every mine around

1056
01:24:43,757 --> 01:24:46,021
gets its payroll held up.

1057
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:51,529
Some say it's the Bolivian Bandits,

1058
01:24:51,767 --> 01:24:53,029
and some say

1059
01:24:53,269 --> 01:24:56,535
<i>that it's the bandidos yanquis.</i>

1060
01:24:56,807 --> 01:24:58,070
Could I see that?

1061
01:25:01,613 --> 01:25:03,514
Mm-hmm.

1062
01:25:03,749 --> 01:25:05,512
Fairly nice-looking piece.

1063
01:25:05,752 --> 01:25:08,016
Can you hit anything?

1064
01:25:08,221 --> 01:25:09,484
Sometimes.

1065
01:25:18,701 --> 01:25:19,998
Hit that.

1066
01:25:26,211 --> 01:25:27,974
No, no, son. No, son.

1067
01:25:28,213 --> 01:25:29,977
I just want to know,

1068
01:25:30,216 --> 01:25:32,481
can you shoot your piece?

1069
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:36,185
Shoot.

1070
01:25:47,505 --> 01:25:49,029
Damn it.

1071
01:25:49,273 --> 01:25:51,036
Can I move?

1072
01:25:51,276 --> 01:25:52,038
Move?

1073
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:54,609
What the hell you mean, move?

1074
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:01,583
I'm better when I move.

1075
01:26:01,822 --> 01:26:02,847
Yeah.

1076
01:26:04,226 --> 01:26:05,989
Well, considering that I'm desperate

1077
01:26:06,228 --> 01:26:08,493
and you're just what I'm looking for,

1078
01:26:08,764 --> 01:26:10,026
on top of which

1079
01:26:10,234 --> 01:26:12,498
you stem from the U.S. of A.,

1080
01:26:12,769 --> 01:26:14,032
we start tomorrow morning.

1081
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:16,002
You mean we got jobs.

1082
01:26:16,241 --> 01:26:17,503
Payroll guard.

1083
01:26:17,776 --> 01:26:18,470
Damn.

1084
01:26:18,711 --> 01:26:20,474
<i>Vámanos a trabajar!</i>

1085
01:26:20,713 --> 01:26:21,806
Hey, Chucho!

1086
01:26:22,048 --> 01:26:22,980
Chucho!

1087
01:26:23,216 --> 01:26:25,344
Oh, don't you remember

1088
01:26:25,586 --> 01:26:28,180
Sweet Betsy from Pike

1089
01:26:28,456 --> 01:26:29,924
Crossed the high mountains

1090
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:32,719
With her lover Ike

1091
01:26:32,962 --> 01:26:34,088
Two yoke of oxen

1092
01:26:34,364 --> 01:26:36,662
And a big yalla dog

1093
01:26:36,867 --> 01:26:38,266
Tall Shanghai rooster

1094
01:26:38,535 --> 01:26:40,332
And one spotted hog

1095
01:26:40,605 --> 01:26:42,698
Toodle-dang
hoodie di-do

1096
01:26:42,941 --> 01:26:44,637
Doodle-dang hoodie ay

1097
01:26:44,877 --> 01:26:46,606
Toodle-dang
hoodie di-do

1098
01:26:46,846 --> 01:26:48,940
Doodle-dang hoodie ay

1099
01:26:49,182 --> 01:26:50,547
Shanghai ran off

1100
01:26:50,784 --> 01:26:52,878
And the cattle all died

1101
01:26:53,121 --> 01:26:54,748
Last piece of bacon...

1102
01:26:54,989 --> 01:26:57,049
I think they're in the trees up ahead.

1103
01:26:57,293 --> 01:26:59,056
In the bushes on the left.

1104
01:26:59,295 --> 01:27:01,059
They're in the trees up ahead.

1105
01:27:01,298 --> 01:27:02,492
You take the trees,

1106
01:27:02,732 --> 01:27:03,995
I'll take the bushes.

1107
01:27:04,235 --> 01:27:06,669
Will you two beginners cut it out?

1108
01:27:06,904 --> 01:27:09,533
Well, we're just trying
to spot an ambush.

1109
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,538
Morons.

1110
01:27:11,778 --> 01:27:14,542
I've got morons on my team.

1111
01:27:14,782 --> 01:27:17,046
Nobody is going to rob us

1112
01:27:17,251 --> 01:27:18,446
going down the mountain.

1113
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,483
We have got no money

1114
01:27:20,722 --> 01:27:21,882
going down the mountain.

1115
01:27:22,157 --> 01:27:24,820
When we have got the money

1116
01:27:25,061 --> 01:27:26,689
on the way back,

1117
01:27:26,963 --> 01:27:28,362
then you can sweat.

1118
01:27:28,598 --> 01:27:29,998
Bingo.

1119
01:27:30,201 --> 01:27:31,327
Move it out!

1120
01:27:32,603 --> 01:27:33,399
Move it!

1121
01:27:56,668 --> 01:27:59,432
We hit this place in June, didn't we?

1122
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,387
Jones!

1123
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:15,716
Give me a hand over here.

1124
01:28:15,959 --> 01:28:18,325
Who am I, Smith or Jones?

1125
01:28:18,595 --> 01:28:19,858
Live.

1126
01:28:37,118 --> 01:28:38,882
About a half hour more,

1127
01:28:39,121 --> 01:28:41,385
and we can start to worry...

1128
01:28:41,624 --> 01:28:42,887
as soon as we get

1129
01:28:43,126 --> 01:28:44,388
to that pass up there.

1130
01:28:44,628 --> 01:28:46,893
We'll be all right till then.

1131
01:28:47,131 --> 01:28:48,894
They might try something here.

1132
01:28:49,133 --> 01:28:50,931
No. Better cover up there.

1133
01:28:53,138 --> 01:28:55,403
You got to relax, you fellas.

1134
01:28:55,675 --> 01:28:58,611
You got to get used to Bolivian ways.

1135
01:28:58,846 --> 01:29:00,609
You got to go easy.

1136
01:29:00,848 --> 01:29:01,611
Damn it!

1137
01:29:01,850 --> 01:29:03,044
Like I do.

1138
01:29:03,251 --> 01:29:06,016
Of course, you probably think I'm crazy,

1139
01:29:06,255 --> 01:29:07,847
but I'm not.

1140
01:29:08,124 --> 01:29:09,387
Bingo.

1141
01:29:09,626 --> 01:29:10,388
I'm colorful.

1142
01:29:10,627 --> 01:29:11,889
That's what happens

1143
01:29:12,129 --> 01:29:14,564
when you live 10 years alone in Bolivia.

1144
01:29:14,799 --> 01:29:16,267
You get colorful.

1145
01:29:36,093 --> 01:29:37,355
Where are they?

1146
01:29:40,632 --> 01:29:42,497
I can't see them.

1147
01:29:56,151 --> 01:29:58,450
Let's get out of here.

1148
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:34,804
Tell them to leave the money and go.

1149
01:31:36,311 --> 01:31:38,780
<i>Dijen el dinoro...</i>

1150
01:31:39,015 --> 01:31:41,280
<i>Dinero... and, uh...</i>

1151
01:31:41,551 --> 01:31:42,916
<i>y vayanese.</i>

1152
01:31:44,789 --> 01:31:47,587
<i>¿Que dejemos el dinero y nos vayamos?</i>

1153
01:31:47,826 --> 01:31:49,418
Tell them we were hired

1154
01:31:49,662 --> 01:31:52,655
to take it back. It's our job.

1155
01:31:52,899 --> 01:31:55,163
Tell them the money isn't ours.

1156
01:31:56,971 --> 01:31:58,199
<i>El dinero...</i>

1157
01:31:58,406 --> 01:31:59,874
<i>no es nuestro.</i>

1158
01:32:00,142 --> 01:32:02,337
<i>No, ya no es de ustedes.</i>

1159
01:32:02,577 --> 01:32:03,840
<i>Ahora es de nosotros.</i>

1160
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,047
<i>Claro.</i>

1161
01:32:07,017 --> 01:32:09,747
We'll try telling them again.

1162
01:32:09,987 --> 01:32:13,924
It's our job. The money isn't ours.

1163
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:17,288
<i>El dinero no es nuestro.</i>

1164
01:32:17,563 --> 01:32:19,122
<i>Lo necesitamos.</i>

1165
01:32:19,332 --> 01:32:21,664
<i>También nosotros necesitamos.</i>

1166
01:32:23,271 --> 01:32:24,533
What do you think?

1167
01:32:24,806 --> 01:32:26,104
Not so good.

1168
01:32:26,308 --> 01:32:28,037
Can you take the two on the right?

1169
01:32:28,277 --> 01:32:31,247
Kid, there's something I
think I ought to tell you.

1170
01:32:31,514 --> 01:32:33,277
I never shot anybody before.

1171
01:32:38,356 --> 01:32:41,292
One hell of a time to tell me.

1172
01:32:47,134 --> 01:32:48,932
Try for the two on the right

1173
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:49,932
dead center.

1174
01:32:50,171 --> 01:32:51,934
That way, if you miss a little,

1175
01:32:52,173 --> 01:32:53,436
you'll still hit something.

1176
01:32:53,709 --> 01:32:55,336
Go.

1177
01:32:55,578 --> 01:32:56,341
Please.

1178
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:57,945
<i>¿Qué?</i>

1179
01:32:58,148 --> 01:32:59,240
<i>Por favor.</i>

1180
01:32:59,516 --> 01:33:00,882
<i>¿Por favor?</i>

1181
01:33:04,623 --> 01:33:13,226
Aah!

1182
01:33:49,179 --> 01:33:51,080
Well, we've gone straight.

1183
01:33:54,986 --> 01:33:56,544
What'll we try now?

1184
01:34:13,844 --> 01:34:16,609
There are other ways of
going straight, you know.

1185
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:33,430
There are other ways of going straight.

1186
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:38,131
There's farming.

1187
01:34:41,745 --> 01:34:43,509
We could buy a place.

1188
01:34:44,949 --> 01:34:47,214
I don't know how to farm.

1189
01:34:50,924 --> 01:34:52,687
What about a ranch, then?

1190
01:34:52,926 --> 01:34:54,827
I don't know.

1191
01:34:55,062 --> 01:34:57,326
The last time we tried ranching

1192
01:34:57,599 --> 01:34:59,362
was during our rustling days.

1193
01:34:59,601 --> 01:35:00,363
Even then,

1194
01:35:00,602 --> 01:35:02,798
we weren't much good at it.

1195
01:35:03,006 --> 01:35:04,769
It's hard. Hours are brutal.

1196
01:35:05,008 --> 01:35:07,273
No, you got to be a kid

1197
01:35:07,544 --> 01:35:08,806
to start a ranch.

1198
01:35:22,931 --> 01:35:24,729
Hey.

1199
01:35:24,967 --> 01:35:25,831
Hmm?

1200
01:35:29,773 --> 01:35:32,538
I might go back ahead of you.

1201
01:35:39,117 --> 01:35:40,745
You mean home?

1202
01:35:42,956 --> 01:35:44,720
I was thinking of it.

1203
01:35:50,432 --> 01:35:51,991
Whatever you want, Etta.

1204
01:35:56,873 --> 01:35:58,135
Maybe I'll go.

1205
01:36:07,887 --> 01:36:09,047
Hey.

1206
01:36:09,289 --> 01:36:10,314
Hmm?

1207
01:36:10,591 --> 01:36:11,853
Etta's thinking of, uh,

1208
01:36:12,059 --> 01:36:14,028
maybe going home ahead of us.

1209
01:36:17,734 --> 01:36:19,133
Whatever she wants.

1210
01:36:21,872 --> 01:36:23,134
I'll go, then.

1211
01:37:01,622 --> 01:37:02,817
<i>¡Manos arriba!</i>

1212
01:37:04,059 --> 01:37:05,321
How much you got?

1213
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:07,825
It's hardly worth it. Alpoca mine.

1214
01:37:08,064 --> 01:37:10,329
I tell you, no more jungle work for me.

1215
01:37:10,567 --> 01:37:12,831
You're getting to be an old maid.

1216
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:15,335
Keep your old maid remarks to yourself.

1217
01:37:15,606 --> 01:37:17,870
I'll work in the city, in the mountains,

1218
01:37:18,077 --> 01:37:20,545
but from now on jungle work is out.

1219
01:37:20,813 --> 01:37:21,575
<i>¿Bandidos yanquis?</i>

1220
01:37:21,815 --> 01:37:22,713
Mm-hmm.

1221
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:25,814
Tell them to be quiet.

1222
01:37:26,053 --> 01:37:27,315
What's the word?

1223
01:37:27,588 --> 01:37:28,350
<i>Quietas.</i>

1224
01:37:28,589 --> 01:37:29,352
<i>Quietas.</i>

1225
01:37:39,503 --> 01:37:40,766
I tell you,

1226
01:37:41,005 --> 01:37:43,269
the jungle's a better
cover for payrolls.

1227
01:37:43,541 --> 01:37:45,806
Kid, I got a right to my opinion,

1228
01:37:46,011 --> 01:37:47,273
and in my opinion,

1229
01:37:47,546 --> 01:37:48,809
there are snakes in the jungle.

1230
01:37:49,015 --> 01:37:50,414
I don't work around snakes.

1231
01:37:50,684 --> 01:37:51,946
What is this place?

1232
01:37:53,387 --> 01:37:54,411
I don't know.

1233
01:37:54,689 --> 01:37:56,180
San Vincente, I think.

1234
01:37:56,391 --> 01:37:57,153
<i>¿Comer?</i>

1235
01:37:57,392 --> 01:37:58,154
<i>Si, Señor.</i>

1236
01:37:58,393 --> 01:37:59,656
<i>Pasen. Juan, ven.</i>

1237
01:37:59,929 --> 01:38:02,193
<i>Llévate los caballos.</i>

1238
01:38:27,597 --> 01:38:29,861
I don't enjoy jungles.
I don't enjoy swamps.

1239
01:38:30,067 --> 01:38:31,329
I don't like snakes.

1240
01:38:31,602 --> 01:38:33,365
I don't much care for night work.

1241
01:38:33,604 --> 01:38:34,697
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

1242
01:38:36,074 --> 01:38:36,870
<i>¡Capitán! ¡Capitán!</i>

1243
01:38:37,109 --> 01:38:38,873
<i>Capitán, allá en la plaza,</i>

1244
01:38:39,112 --> 01:38:41,877
<i>hay una mula de las minas de Alpoca.</i>

1245
01:38:42,116 --> 01:38:43,378
<i>¿Las minas de Alpoca?</i>

1246
01:38:43,617 --> 01:38:44,879
<i>Sí, sí. Allí están.</i>

1247
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:46,883
<i>Dos hombres la acaban de traer.</i>

1248
01:38:47,122 --> 01:38:48,646
<i>Están comiendo en el
restaurante de mi papá.</i>

1249
01:38:48,890 --> 01:38:51,325
<i>El guisado está delicioso.</i>

1250
01:38:51,594 --> 01:38:53,859
<i>Para chuparse los dedos.</i>

1251
01:38:54,064 --> 01:38:56,829
<i>Si quieren mas, es la
especialidad de la casa,</i>

1252
01:38:57,068 --> 01:38:58,330
<i>si quieren mas,</i>

1253
01:38:58,603 --> 01:38:59,865
<i>no tengan pena y díganmelo.</i>

1254
01:39:00,071 --> 01:39:01,835
<i>Yo estoy aquí para servirles.</i>

1255
01:39:02,074 --> 01:39:04,202
<i>Agradezco la visita de tan
distinguidos caballeros.</i>

1256
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:07,842
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

1257
01:39:08,082 --> 01:39:09,140
<i>Para servirles.</i>

1258
01:39:09,417 --> 01:39:10,042
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

1259
01:39:10,284 --> 01:39:11,046
<i>Sí.</i>

1260
01:39:14,389 --> 01:39:16,153
The specialty of the house,

1261
01:39:16,392 --> 01:39:17,654
and it's still moving.

1262
01:39:24,903 --> 01:39:26,165
Well, that settles it.

1263
01:39:26,371 --> 01:39:28,636
This place gets no more of my business.

1264
01:39:37,852 --> 01:39:38,945
Hey.

1265
01:39:39,188 --> 01:39:40,052
What?

1266
01:39:40,289 --> 01:39:43,418
What do you think? I
bet it's just one guy.

1267
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:55,097
Don't you get sick of
being right all the time?

1268
01:40:24,745 --> 01:40:25,871
Reloading.

1269
01:40:29,217 --> 01:40:30,479
That's all I got.

1270
01:40:34,657 --> 01:40:35,920
We're going to run out

1271
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:39,722
unless we can get to that
mule and get some more.

1272
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:45,430
I'll go.

1273
01:40:45,671 --> 01:40:48,641
This is no time for
bravery. I'll let you.

1274
01:40:51,145 --> 01:40:51,941
Loaded.

1275
01:40:59,022 --> 01:41:00,148
Hell!

1276
01:41:00,390 --> 01:41:02,586
I'm the one that has to go.

1277
01:41:04,195 --> 01:41:05,253
Why you?

1278
01:41:05,496 --> 01:41:07,556
'Cause I could never give you cover.

1279
01:41:07,833 --> 01:41:09,597
You can cover me.

1280
01:41:11,437 --> 01:41:14,236
You can see I'm right, can't you?

1281
01:41:21,650 --> 01:41:23,049
You go.

1282
01:41:23,285 --> 01:41:25,811
Yeah, why am I always so damn smart?

1283
01:41:32,798 --> 01:41:33,560
Here.

1284
01:41:41,876 --> 01:41:42,638
Go.

1285
01:42:00,533 --> 01:42:01,295
O.K.

1286
01:42:41,318 --> 01:42:42,080
Go.

1287
01:43:43,129 --> 01:43:43,891
Ah!

1288
01:44:28,019 --> 01:44:31,217
Is... Is that what
you call giving cover?

1289
01:44:31,423 --> 01:44:34,187
Is that what you call running?

1290
01:44:34,427 --> 01:44:37,191
If I knew you were going to stroll...

1291
01:44:38,432 --> 01:44:39,694
You never could shoot,

1292
01:44:39,967 --> 01:44:41,730
not from the very beginning.

1293
01:44:47,944 --> 01:44:49,708
And you are all mouth.

1294
01:44:58,591 --> 01:45:00,252
<i>Jefe, llega el ejército.</i>

1295
01:45:12,142 --> 01:45:12,904
<i>Mi capitán.</i>

1296
01:45:14,878 --> 01:45:15,640
<i>¿Dónde están?</i>

1297
01:45:15,879 --> 01:45:17,142
<i>Allí en la plaza.</i>

1298
01:45:17,381 --> 01:45:18,575
<i>¿Cuántos hombres son?</i>

1299
01:45:18,816 --> 01:45:19,578
<i>Dos hombres.</i>

1300
01:45:19,818 --> 01:45:20,580
<i>¿Dos hombres?</i>

1301
01:45:20,819 --> 01:45:22,081
<i>Mi capitán, por favor...</i>

1302
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:23,082
<i>¿Dos?</i>

1303
01:45:23,321 --> 01:45:24,346
<i>Bandidos yanquis.</i>

1304
01:45:24,624 --> 01:45:25,886
<i>¿Bandidos yanquis, eh?</i>

1305
01:45:26,092 --> 01:45:27,355
<i>Sí, mi capitán.</i>

1306
01:45:27,628 --> 01:45:28,390
Hmm.

1307
01:45:28,629 --> 01:45:29,891
<i>Sargento Rico,</i>

1308
01:45:30,097 --> 01:45:31,395
<i>desmonten 20 hombres</i>

1309
01:45:31,666 --> 01:45:33,395
<i>y vayan con el teniente.</i>

1310
01:46:47,095 --> 01:46:49,859
I've got a great idea
where we should go next.

1311
01:46:50,098 --> 01:46:51,862
I don't want to hear it.

1312
01:46:52,101 --> 01:46:53,363
You'll change your mind.

1313
01:46:53,602 --> 01:46:54,364
Shut up!

1314
01:46:54,604 --> 01:46:55,366
O.K., O.K.

1315
01:46:55,605 --> 01:46:56,867
Your ideas got us here.

1316
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:58,072
Forget it!

1317
01:46:58,275 --> 01:47:01,040
I never want to hear
another of your ideas.

1318
01:47:01,312 --> 01:47:02,074
All right.

1319
01:47:02,314 --> 01:47:03,008
O.K.

1320
01:47:12,693 --> 01:47:13,752
Australia.

1321
01:47:16,832 --> 01:47:19,529
I figured secretly you wanted to know,

1322
01:47:19,769 --> 01:47:21,031
so I told you.

1323
01:47:21,238 --> 01:47:22,205
Australia.

1324
01:47:24,107 --> 01:47:25,370
That's your great idea?

1325
01:47:25,643 --> 01:47:27,406
Oh, boy, it's the latest in...

1326
01:47:27,645 --> 01:47:28,908
in a long line.

1327
01:47:29,148 --> 01:47:30,911
Australia's no better than here.

1328
01:47:31,150 --> 01:47:32,412
Aw, that's all you know.

1329
01:47:32,652 --> 01:47:33,914
Name me one thing.

1330
01:47:34,154 --> 01:47:35,917
They speak English in Australia.

1331
01:47:36,156 --> 01:47:36,919
They do?

1332
01:47:37,158 --> 01:47:38,420
That's right, smart guy.

1333
01:47:38,659 --> 01:47:39,921
So we wouldn't be foreigners.

1334
01:47:41,530 --> 01:47:42,792
They got horses in Australia.

1335
01:47:43,031 --> 01:47:46,297
They got thousands of
miles we could hide out in.

1336
01:47:46,536 --> 01:47:48,300
And a good climate, nice beaches.

1337
01:47:48,539 --> 01:47:49,801
You could learn to swim.

1338
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:50,802
No!

1339
01:47:51,041 --> 01:47:52,441
Swimming isn't important.

1340
01:47:55,414 --> 01:47:57,905
What about the banks?

1341
01:47:58,150 --> 01:47:59,641
They're easy.

1342
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:01,410
Easy, ripe, and luscious.

1343
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:07,224
The banks or the women?

1344
01:48:07,463 --> 01:48:10,227
Well, once you've got
one, you've got the other.

1345
01:48:13,136 --> 01:48:14,900
It's a long way, isn't it?

1346
01:48:15,139 --> 01:48:17,403
Aw! Everything's got
to be perfect with you.

1347
01:48:17,675 --> 01:48:19,371
I don't want to get there

1348
01:48:19,578 --> 01:48:20,840
and find out it stinks.

1349
01:48:21,079 --> 01:48:22,240
At least think about it.

1350
01:48:25,184 --> 01:48:26,209
All right.

1351
01:48:27,788 --> 01:48:29,050
I'll think about it.

1352
01:48:34,196 --> 01:48:34,958
Hey.

1353
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:38,531
When we get outside...

1354
01:48:38,769 --> 01:48:41,034
and we get to the horses,

1355
01:48:41,272 --> 01:48:42,534
just remember one thing.

1356
01:48:46,779 --> 01:48:48,041
Hey, wait a minute.

1357
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:49,748
What?

1358
01:48:49,983 --> 01:48:52,748
You didn't see LeFors
out there, did you?

1359
01:48:52,987 --> 01:48:53,885
LeFors?

1360
01:48:55,222 --> 01:48:56,986
No.

1361
01:48:57,225 --> 01:48:59,193
Oh, good.

1362
01:48:59,428 --> 01:49:00,691
For a moment there,

1363
01:49:00,964 --> 01:49:03,159
I thought we were in trouble.

1364
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:09,899
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

1365
01:49:12,511 --> 01:49:13,375
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

1366
01:49:16,717 --> 01:49:17,741
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

1367
01:49:18,305 --> 01:49:24,799
