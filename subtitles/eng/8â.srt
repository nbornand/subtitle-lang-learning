00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:41,086
Something's wrong with it.
Could you check the magazine?

3
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:43,130
Let's have a look at it.

4
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:51,533
Maybe the release is stuck.

5
00:02:51,617 --> 00:02:54,894
I'll replace it. Won't take a minute.
Just hold on.

6
00:03:13,023 --> 00:03:16,221
Don't move!
Don't breathe, don't hit the alarm!

7
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:18,057
We want guns and ammo!

8
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:20,579
Stay there and you won't get hurt!

9
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:30,982
Freeze! Make a move and you're dead!

10
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:35,260
You, drop your gun, slowly.

11
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,629
You, put your hands on top of your head.

12
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:45,746
Get down on your knees.
Down on your knees!

13
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:51,143
Stay!

14
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:53,829
And, you, get on the counter.

15
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:55,590
Slowly.

16
00:03:57,836 --> 00:03:58,952
Stay.

17
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:03,234
Hands on top of your head.

18
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,316
Okay, fellows.
The tip paid off. I got them. Come on in.

19
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:13,476
<i>Roger.</i>

20
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:16,076
<i>Doug, your buddy Forrest
doesn't answer from Tampa.</i>

21
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:17,834
<i>You want me to keep on trying?</i>

22
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:19,436
I'll try him later.

23
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:27,034
-By the way, is this your first flight?
-Yes, it is.

24
00:04:28,405 --> 00:04:31,523
A helicopter is like a woman,
a beautiful woman.

25
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:34,926
It's very delicate.

26
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:39,721
You like music?
Imagine you're dancing a waltz.

27
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:10,533
I feel sick.
I don't think helicopters are for me.

28
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,377
Are you sure?

29
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,768
Why not? It's so easy. Come on.

30
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,420
This is Doug Bennet.
I'm calling from New York.

31
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:24,697
May I speak to Steve Forrest, please?

32
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:28,061
He's still flying? Okay, I'll call him back.

33
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:30,054
-What's going on?
-He asked for it!

34
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,937
Let him go.

35
00:05:32,744 --> 00:05:35,339
You bastard, you're worse than he is.

36
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:41,904
That's the only picture I have
of my friend Steve.

37
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:46,860
Just get rid of him.

38
00:05:57,871 --> 00:05:59,783
I'm sorry about that, Steve.

39
00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:05,304
Tampa Flying School. Can I help you?

40
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:07,829
Hi, this is Bennet again. Has he landed?

41
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:09,913
One moment, please.

42
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:13,911
Hi.

43
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:16,676
Who is it?

44
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:18,556
Come on.

45
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,911
This is Steve Forrest's answering service.
I am out right now.

46
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,400
So please leave me your name, number,
and message after the beep.

47
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:35,436
Very funny, Steve.

48
00:06:35,882 --> 00:06:37,441
My favourite voice.

49
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:40,880
Listen, Joe Garret got out of jail yesterday.

50
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:42,643
Why are you calling me?

51
00:06:42,724 --> 00:06:45,683
It's the only case we never solved
in our whole career.

52
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:49,076
<i>It's your career, Blue Eyes.
I resigned two years ago.</i>

53
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:52,405
You're not getting me back
until they give me permission...

54
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:54,843
to use my fists on bad guys.

55
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:56,561
I've got no time for Boy Scouts.

56
00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:00,079
Listen, about Garret.

57
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,083
After he left jail,
he got in touch with someone in Miami.

58
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:06,639
He's on his way down there
this very minute.

59
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:08,609
Yeah? I got news for you.

60
00:07:08,692 --> 00:07:12,288
Ten of my students are having tests
in the air next week...

61
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:14,683
and you're trying to tell me
about an old robbery.

62
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:18,012
Robbery? The robbery. $20 million, Steve.

63
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:23,006
Even if it was $200 million,
my students' tests still come first.

64
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:24,416
Come on, Steve.

65
00:07:24,497 --> 00:07:28,207
Garret's on flight Eastern 181.

66
00:07:28,298 --> 00:07:29,936
He'll land in 45 minutes.

67
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:33,409
That'll give you enough time
to get there and trail him. I thought--

68
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:36,060
You thought wrong! Over and out.

69
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:50,995
Keep on driving.

70
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:54,917
Get the wallets, the jewellery! Hurry up!

71
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:10,366
This money is all I've got.

72
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:13,440
No, there's nothing in here. Just documents.

73
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,203
Okay, stop right up here.

74
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:27,925
Come on, let's go.

75
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,694
All right!

76
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:39,648
Calm down, folks!

77
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:44,205
We're not far from the police station.
I'll take you there, okay?

78
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:14,542
-Chief?
-Come on in, Lyon.

79
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:22,220
One of the passengers is missing.
He must have slipped.

80
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:25,460
-What makes you think that, Lyon?
-His bags are there, he ain't.

81
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:29,590
Great thinking. Go through the bags
and see if you can come up with a name.

82
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,309
Done that already.

83
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:33,860
This is a release from San Quentin.

84
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:37,901
The guy's name is Garret.
He got out of the pen two days ago.

85
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:41,663
-Garret. That name mean anything to you?
-Afraid not, Captain.

86
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:44,144
Didn't think it would.
Joe Garret was convicted...

87
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:47,512
of robbing the Detroit First National Bank
of $20 million.

88
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:51,351
He was arrested immediately
by two real cops, friends of mine.

89
00:10:51,437 --> 00:10:54,794
He served nine years,
and he never snitched on his accomplices.

90
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:57,393
I wonder what brings him to Miami
in such a hurry.

91
00:10:57,479 --> 00:11:01,473
Sooner or later, everybody comes to Miami.
The sun's always shining.

92
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,597
Right, the sun's always shining.

93
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,526
Hey, have you got a light?

94
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:43,208
Why, I hardly touched you.

95
00:11:44,693 --> 00:11:47,366
You could at least say hello to me.

96
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:50,014
I'm sorry.
I guess I don't know my own strength.

97
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:53,849
-I didn't mean to hurt you.
-Bill, looks like you found some company.

98
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:58,690
Friend, cut the sunshine. I'm a nightbird.

99
00:12:02,218 --> 00:12:03,412
He's dead.

100
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:07,492
Dead? I'm innocent!
I wanna talk to my attorney!

101
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,291
Richie, get two ambulances.
One for the hospital, one for the morgue.

102
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:19,220
Com. Risner just won't get off my case.

103
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:24,374
The minute we heard Garret was in town,
we tried to pick him up.

104
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:28,060
-But we missed him. Result: Garret's dead.
-Yeah, I heard.

105
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:31,224
We at the Bureau
are taking an interest in the case.

106
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:35,425
Why don't you let me handle this thing?
I can't let Risner force me into retirement.

107
00:12:35,507 --> 00:12:38,784
You know things haven't been going well
at the station with me lately.

108
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:40,348
Risner likes to remind me of that.

109
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:43,228
As far as I'm concerned,
you're welcome to work on the case.

110
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,143
As long as you don't get in the way
of my boys.

111
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,462
I want the Bureau to work on it,
but with the agents of my choice.

112
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:53,148
-Who do you have in mind?
-Doug Bennet and Steve Forrest.

113
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:55,224
I don't know the names.

114
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:58,471
They're with the New York office.
Class agents.

115
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:03,108
A long time ago, when I was up north,
they were on the police force with me.

116
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:05,835
To be exact,
they're the ones that caught Garret.

117
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,509
What do you want me to do?

118
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:10,476
Lend me Bennet and Forrest.
They can pass as city cops.

119
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:11,911
Undercover?

120
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:19,958
Can do. I'll call the New York office today.

121
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:36,999
<i>Agent Bennet, the Chief wants you
in his office on the double.</i>

122
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:46,760
You wanted to see me, sir?

123
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:49,079
You interested in handling the Garret case?

124
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:52,367
Yes, sir. I had him trailed
from the minute he got out of jail.

125
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,249
And naturally, you asked for help
from your old buddy Forrest.

126
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:57,640
But because he's still upset,
he turned you down.

127
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:58,847
You got it, sir.

128
00:13:58,932 --> 00:14:01,492
-In the meantime, they killed Garret.
-Right.

129
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:04,724
Which leads us to believe that
his accomplice and $20 million...

130
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:07,089
is somewhere in the Miami area.

131
00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:11,407
Your assignment is to fly to Tampa.
Convince Forrest to work with you.

132
00:14:11,495 --> 00:14:14,135
You'll be taking orders
from your old acquaintance...

133
00:14:14,216 --> 00:14:16,333
Capt. Tanney of the Hialeah Police.

134
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:17,930
All right, sir.

135
00:14:19,738 --> 00:14:22,572
By the way,
how are you gonna convince him?

136
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,810
I'll twist his arm a little.

137
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,654
One more step and I'll break your legs.

138
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:36,102
Hi, Steve. Long time no see.

139
00:14:36,383 --> 00:14:38,294
Let's keep it that way.

140
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:41,179
What a way to greet your buddy.

141
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,343
Save your breath. You're wasting your time.

142
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:47,980
Look, Steve,
I came to ask you to come on back.

143
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:51,184
Are you deaf?
You're wasting your time. Go home.

144
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:56,539
Steve, you're gonna change your mind.

145
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:59,061
No way, Blue Eyes.

146
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,664
Not even if I tell you they killed...

147
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,261
our old chief, Capt. Tanney?

148
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:13,592
When? Who?

149
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:17,945
It could have been the same guys
who bumped off Garret.

150
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,508
-Let's go.
-Yeah, let's go.

151
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:07,923
Funny. After seven years in prison...

152
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,404
Garret comes down here
to get the $20 million.

153
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,447
Instead, he gets killed.

154
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:15,841
Life's strange, isn't it, Steve?

155
00:16:21,493 --> 00:16:24,292
Charlie, isn't it exciting
getting away from New York...

156
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:26,605
and the constant threat of violence?

157
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,739
Keep on rolling, pal.

158
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:04,380
Okay, monkey face, give me the loot.

159
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:07,022
Wake up. He's talking to you.

160
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:11,981
Steve, wake up! He's talking to you!

161
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:17,661
Freeze. Get them up there!

162
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,422
You two up front there!

163
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:22,464
Don't try it!

164
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:33,225
Freeze! Stop!

165
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:43,516
Sit there.

166
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,790
Just like old times.
Back in the saddle again.

167
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:52,837
I'm gonna leave you my bag
and these punks to take in by yourself.

168
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,470
-Why? Where are you going?
-To visit Tanney's widow.

169
00:17:58,762 --> 00:18:01,196
What's the hurry? We can go later.

170
00:18:01,683 --> 00:18:03,594
Sorry, Doug, I prefer to go now.

171
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,321
-Hi, Mrs. Tanney.
-Steve.

172
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:33,720
There was a time when you called me Carol.
Come in.

173
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,131
Thank you.

174
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:43,766
I heard what happened and I...

175
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:46,848
Yes. Very kind of you. Thank you.

176
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:50,729
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

177
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:55,613
I'm going to miss him so much.

178
00:18:55,978 --> 00:18:58,095
He was so sweet.

179
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:00,370
His loss is a real tragedy.

180
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,421
Intelligent, sensitive.

181
00:19:03,821 --> 00:19:06,381
Yes, a real loving companion.

182
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,932
That is so true. I wrote it on his tombstone.

183
00:19:10,103 --> 00:19:12,014
He was always so happy.

184
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,053
Happy?

185
00:19:15,424 --> 00:19:19,304
He jumped and licked and gnawed,
pawed all over the place.

186
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,820
Jumped?

187
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:24,776
And he was so polite.

188
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:29,507
-Polite? If you say so.
-He never messed on the carpets.

189
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:31,782
He'd wait at the back door...

190
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:34,907
so he could be let out
and do it in the garden.

191
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,905
You've got an outhouse?

192
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:45,790
Steve, he'll be so happy to see you.

193
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:49,506
-See me?
-He's coming home early tonight.

194
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:54,547
Listen, Carol...

195
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:58,832
I know when these things happen
it comes as a terrible shock...

196
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:01,796
-but I'm a bit--
-That'll be him. Excuse me.

197
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,828
Hello? Yes, honey.

198
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,831
Not those young hoods again?

199
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:16,512
It was Doug? Tell him hi from me.

200
00:20:17,362 --> 00:20:19,877
Honey, you'll never guess who's here.

201
00:20:19,963 --> 00:20:21,919
No, it'll be a surprise.

202
00:20:23,364 --> 00:20:25,320
You're going to be late?

203
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,924
Never mind, honey. Bye.

204
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:35,606
He said he'll be...
Steve? Isn't that strange.

205
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,519
Can I help?

206
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:49,568
-Did they take anything from you?
-No, thanks.

207
00:20:49,652 --> 00:20:52,291
-Do you wanna file charges?
-No, thanks.

208
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,773
Can I help you, sir? Can I help you?

209
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:29,897
Sir, wait a minute. Where are you going?

210
00:21:39,346 --> 00:21:42,020
Hi, Steve. What took you so long?
I was waiting for you.

211
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:43,335
Me, too.

212
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:45,947
-Steve?
-Yes.

213
00:21:47,068 --> 00:21:50,027
Yes, what? I'm Steve. Hi, Chief.

214
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,987
-How you doing?
-All right.

215
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,029
You know,
this bastard told me you were dead.

216
00:21:55,111 --> 00:21:58,422
Doug, you didn't have to go that far
to help me out.

217
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:00,549
What are you talking about?

218
00:22:00,632 --> 00:22:02,749
Police Commissioner's giving me
a hard time.

219
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,507
If I don't solve the Garret case,
he will make me retire.

220
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:09,713
And after all these years on the force,
I wouldn't know what to do.

221
00:22:10,115 --> 00:22:11,594
What can I do for you?

222
00:22:11,676 --> 00:22:15,032
I don't have the guts to ask you,
but I really need your help.

223
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:16,106
He does.

224
00:22:16,197 --> 00:22:18,837
Will you shut up? I decide for myself.

225
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:25,953
If I had the students' tests
postponed for a while...

226
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,111
Okay, I'll help you, Chief.

227
00:22:30,321 --> 00:22:33,120
We're having a lot of robberies
in the north end of the city.

228
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:37,754
We've got a BOLO out for two white males
operating a 1984 dark blue Ford.

229
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:40,275
No other info on that.

230
00:22:40,364 --> 00:22:44,074
Now I want you to meet
a couple of new cops. Stand up, fellows.

231
00:22:45,245 --> 00:22:47,714
This is Jess Donnel and L.A. Wray.

232
00:22:47,926 --> 00:22:50,521
Look a little grown-up to be rookies.

233
00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:57,767
Hey, funny boy, what are you laughing at?

234
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:01,647
It's not his fault.
He was born that way, right?

235
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,524
"Born that way"? Yeah, that's right.

236
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,128
All right, guys, let's hit the streets.

237
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:09,884
You two guys wait.

238
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:23,133
Remember, nobody here's
supposed to know who you are.

239
00:23:23,216 --> 00:23:26,448
Just go out on patrol, handle anything
that goes down in your sector.

240
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:29,735
But remember,
your main object is the Garret case.

241
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:33,053
Here's the keys to the address
where you'll be staying.

242
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:34,493
It's small but comfortable.

243
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,616
What's with this collection you've got here?

244
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:41,733
Terry Clay was a good cop.
He was killed about three weeks ago.

245
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:45,702
He was very close to getting his hands
on the expressway robbers.

246
00:23:45,783 --> 00:23:48,457
But he had this thing for working solo.

247
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,779
-Put in $20.
-Yeah, I was going to.

248
00:23:55,986 --> 00:23:57,419
That's yours.

249
00:23:57,947 --> 00:23:59,585
I just put it in.

250
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:02,106
Put in another $20.

251
00:24:02,628 --> 00:24:04,220
-Really?
-For me.

252
00:24:04,748 --> 00:24:08,663
-Why don't you put it in yourself?
-Forgot my wallet. I'll pay you back later.

253
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,585
Come on, won't you ever change?
Always generous with my money.

254
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:43,949
I don't know how we're gonna meet tonight.
It's just impossible.

255
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,676
You know, I'm a little sore at you also.

256
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:50,311
That guy. What's his name?
With all those muscles?

257
00:24:54,043 --> 00:24:55,715
I'll tell you something...

258
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:03,718
I bet you're here to talk about
that guy Garret in Room 5, right?

259
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:05,637
Right, you win the bet.

260
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:08,924
Hey, look here.
He registered under his own name.

261
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,487
Anyone visit him?

262
00:25:10,568 --> 00:25:13,447
-Visit who?
-Garret.

263
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:17,003
Well, besides the cockroaches, no.

264
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,444
What did he do?

265
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:22,319
Nothing. Unless you call coming in
and going out...

266
00:25:22,411 --> 00:25:25,848
and coming in again doing something.
You know what I mean?

267
00:25:25,932 --> 00:25:28,242
No, we don't. You wanna tell us?

268
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:32,645
A guy comes in and checks in, right?
What does he do?

269
00:25:32,734 --> 00:25:35,408
-What did Garret do?
-He goes out, he comes in.

270
00:25:35,495 --> 00:25:38,408
He sleeps, etcetera, etcetera.

271
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:43,374
It's the "etceteras, etceteras"
that interests us, considering he was killed.

272
00:25:43,457 --> 00:25:44,527
What do you know about him?

273
00:25:44,618 --> 00:25:46,848
-You must know something.
-Not me. Listen here.

274
00:25:46,938 --> 00:25:49,976
-He wasn't killed in this hotel.
-We know that.

275
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:52,813
-Did he make any calls?
-A bunch of them.

276
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,615
-Are they registered?
-No way.

277
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:58,536
He used the public phone over there, right?

278
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:02,502
-Yeah, that's right. How did you know that?
-One of my many talents.

279
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,016
Who did he talk to?

280
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:07,813
Listen, rule number one
in this business is you never...

281
00:26:08,265 --> 00:26:10,984
never listen to guests' phone calls.

282
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:15,700
-Come on, get the key. Show us the room.
-Yes, sir, right away.

283
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:25,389
Pardon me.

284
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,985
This way.

285
00:26:35,913 --> 00:26:37,426
This is Room 5.

286
00:26:50,797 --> 00:26:52,993
What happened in here afterwards?

287
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:56,435
-Afterwards when?
-After they found him dead.

288
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,433
Anything you didn't connect with Garret.

289
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,432
There was one thing.

290
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:06,199
I don't think you'd find
that very interesting.

291
00:27:06,281 --> 00:27:07,715
Why don't you try us?

292
00:27:07,802 --> 00:27:10,954
After the cops left,
some guy checks in this room.

293
00:27:11,523 --> 00:27:14,561
-Were all the other rooms full?
-That's the point.

294
00:27:14,644 --> 00:27:17,398
There was Room 3, Room 7.

295
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:22,319
This guy insists on Room 5.
I mean, he insisted.

296
00:27:22,926 --> 00:27:24,565
What else did he do?

297
00:27:24,647 --> 00:27:27,765
He checks into the room, locks himself in...

298
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,804
and doesn't come out until the next day.
He paid and split.

299
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:34,479
-Weird, isn't it?
-What's so weird about it?

300
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,367
He didn't even sleep.

301
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,681
He left that room cleaner when he left
than when he first came in.

302
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:42,967
No kidding? Describe the guy.

303
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:44,971
B-l-G.

304
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:49,403
Big. I mean, a brute. Indian.

305
00:27:51,735 --> 00:27:56,207
-Did he sign the register?
-Of course, silly. Sitting Bull.

306
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,496
At the time,
I thought the name was very familiar.

307
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,614
Do you happen to know him?

308
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:04,491
Very funny.

309
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:07,210
Do you remember
anything unusual about him?

310
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:12,250
Muscle upon muscle upon muscle.

311
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:15,254
Okay, we understand you like muscles.
What else?

312
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:19,734
Has to be an ex-fighter.
I know, I could spot one anywhere.

313
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:28,298
All these guys look like heavyweights to me.

314
00:28:28,385 --> 00:28:30,695
Yeah, but our guy's a carpenter.

315
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:33,896
A carpenter.
What makes you think he's a carpenter?

316
00:28:33,987 --> 00:28:36,821
He took the whole room apart
and then put it back together.

317
00:28:36,908 --> 00:28:40,140
-He's a real pro.
-What the hell was he looking for?

318
00:28:40,229 --> 00:28:42,299
Maybe he's a cockroach collector.

319
00:29:12,158 --> 00:29:15,993
Chief, do you know a carpenter around here
who used to be a wrestler?

320
00:29:38,006 --> 00:29:39,598
Freeze! Hold it!

321
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:46,439
Let's give him a hand.

322
00:30:11,896 --> 00:30:15,333
-They got you mad, Sitting Bull?
-I didn't need your help.

323
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,127
I know. We need yours.

324
00:30:18,578 --> 00:30:19,647
Why?

325
00:30:21,098 --> 00:30:23,693
What were you doing in Garret's room?

326
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,099
Follow me.

327
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,537
I don't like to be seen
talking to Gen. Custer's boys.

328
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,136
By the way, the name's Charro.

329
00:30:55,068 --> 00:30:57,902
Okay, Charro,
what were you doing in Garret's room?

330
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,299
You were in there for 24 hours.

331
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:04,145
Dismantling and putting things
back together. That's my job.

332
00:31:04,991 --> 00:31:08,302
-What were you looking for?
-$20 million would be a good bet.

333
00:31:08,392 --> 00:31:12,511
All the money in the world
ain't worth a damn compared to a friend.

334
00:31:13,073 --> 00:31:14,553
Very touching.

335
00:31:16,755 --> 00:31:17,904
Go on.

336
00:31:20,236 --> 00:31:21,715
All I found...

337
00:31:22,356 --> 00:31:25,633
was a screwdriver and a hammer.

338
00:31:28,838 --> 00:31:31,273
-Maybe they didn't belong to Garret.
-Maybe.

339
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,669
Okay, what's the story
between you and him?

340
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,436
We shared a cell in San Quentin.
He saved my life once.

341
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:41,800
-To pay him back, you stabbed him?
-No. I read the news in the paper...

342
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:46,161
and decided to do a little investigating
on my own. I felt I owed him.

343
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:50,153
-Did you see him before he got killed?
-Yeah. He needed money.

344
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:52,713
Some punks ripped him off on a bus.

345
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:55,042
Figures. What else?

346
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:58,722
He said a guy who pulled the robbery
with him had to be here in Miami.

347
00:31:58,807 --> 00:32:00,763
Garret wanted his share.

348
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:04,684
He knew how to get it because
he had the goods on the guy who has it.

349
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:08,319
Yeah, and unfortunately
the guy found him first.

350
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,369
And shut him up for good.

351
00:32:12,451 --> 00:32:14,920
Then took the goods with him, right?

352
00:32:15,012 --> 00:32:19,564
No, Garret was too smart.
He went to the appointment empty-handed.

353
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:24,890
He hid whatever he had on the guy so well...

354
00:32:25,615 --> 00:32:27,765
even I couldn't find it.

355
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:43,378
Don't suppose he told you the guy's name?

356
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,535
No.

357
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:48,576
Okay, Charro, thanks.

358
00:32:49,062 --> 00:32:52,851
If you think of anything else,
give us a call at this number.

359
00:32:53,903 --> 00:32:56,896
If you find Garret's killer, let me know.

360
00:32:57,184 --> 00:33:00,063
I have a few things I'd like to say to him.

361
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:02,825
Okay, Charro, you do the rest.

362
00:33:09,828 --> 00:33:12,262
If Charro finds Garret's
killer before we do...

363
00:33:12,348 --> 00:33:15,147
there won't be much left for the autopsy.

364
00:33:31,554 --> 00:33:34,194
Route 31, north,
between the bridge and the gas cisterns.

365
00:33:34,275 --> 00:33:37,586
<i>Hurry. I mean, hurry.
They're blasting at me with cannons.</i>

366
00:33:37,676 --> 00:33:41,192
Hold them off, honey. This is Car 27.
We're on our way. Hit it.

367
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,971
Freeze! Hands up!

368
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:42,804
You, get up! Hands on your head!

369
00:34:47,776 --> 00:34:50,530
Turn around, slowly.

370
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:54,809
Okay, down on your knees.

371
00:34:58,659 --> 00:34:59,775
Stop.

372
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,330
You, left hand behind your back.

373
00:35:06,622 --> 00:35:07,975
Right hand.

374
00:35:28,908 --> 00:35:30,308
Is she okay?

375
00:35:31,069 --> 00:35:33,903
-Everything all right?
-Yeah, thanks to you.

376
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,025
Good.

377
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,939
Not as bad as I thought.
Broken window, a few scratches.

378
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:41,466
Hey, congratulations. You hit the jackpot.

379
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:44,147
-What do you mean?
-You get the $50,000.

380
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:47,031
The reward from the Truckers' Association
for catching them.

381
00:35:47,113 --> 00:35:48,467
Hey, we're rich.

382
00:35:48,554 --> 00:35:51,388
Yeah, now you can pay me back
what you owe me.

383
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:53,705
I'd have paid you back anyway.

384
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:06,474
And apart from
the Governor's congratulations...

385
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:09,358
and the City's, of course, you also get this:

386
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,192
a cheque for $50,000.

387
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:18,921
Which, of course, you can't keep
since cops can't accept rewards.

388
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:23,163
Nuts, I really wanted to get a Porsche.

389
00:36:23,284 --> 00:36:26,436
And there goes the down payment
on the new chopper.

390
00:36:30,126 --> 00:36:32,083
We've got a better idea.

391
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:37,807
Now that'll take care
of the Clay kids' college.

392
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:40,887
Guys, we all thank you
from the 8th Precinct.

393
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:46,048
-Okay, it's from all of us.
-Since we can't have it.

394
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:48,042
Okay, you can go, guys.

395
00:36:50,332 --> 00:36:52,369
-Jess.
-Yes, Chief.

396
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:55,286
You're off today.

397
00:36:55,373 --> 00:36:58,810
But tonight, put on your best threads
and go to Club Violins.

398
00:36:58,894 --> 00:37:02,092
You'll meet a C.I. there
who's got something on Garret for you.

399
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:03,655
How do we recognise him?

400
00:37:03,736 --> 00:37:07,173
He'll recognise you. You just be there.
See you later.

401
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:12,008
It's gonna be tough on you.

402
00:37:12,618 --> 00:37:13,688
Why?

403
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:16,817
Putting on your best threads
and looking human.

404
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,374
Speak for yourself, ET.

405
00:37:42,467 --> 00:37:44,698
Gentlemen, what will you have?

406
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:48,186
I'll have a piña colada,
lots of piña, no rum.

407
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:51,062
Blonde Mary for me.

408
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,902
We ain't got no blonde Mary.

409
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,869
I've got a red Kitty, a brunette Barbara...

410
00:37:56,431 --> 00:38:01,348
a black Diane, or a yellow Mingto:
a gorgeous thing, just in from Hong Kong.

411
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:02,866
How long have you been doing this?

412
00:38:02,953 --> 00:38:05,946
Just fix it with tomato juice, vodka,
and pepper.

413
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,105
Oh, you mean a Bloody Mary.

414
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:10,305
Come on, I'm anti-violence.
What's in a name?

415
00:38:10,395 --> 00:38:11,624
Got you.

416
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:16,112
We're here, where's the informer?
How come they're always late?

417
00:38:16,197 --> 00:38:18,587
Informers? Rats is more like it.

418
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:21,549
Would you mind passing me
the peanuts, please?

419
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,674
Sure.

420
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,590
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

421
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:27,353
Not only are they always late,
they smell like a latrine.

422
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,638
That's because they're scared.
It's the adrenalin.

423
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:34,591
Considering the kind of work they do,
it's not surprising.

424
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:36,596
To our meeting.

425
00:38:37,203 --> 00:38:40,082
As you can see, not all informers are late.

426
00:38:40,564 --> 00:38:43,363
And they don't all smell like a latrine.

427
00:38:43,525 --> 00:38:46,723
And as for rats, I won't even discuss it.

428
00:38:47,646 --> 00:38:49,239
My name's Irene.

429
00:38:49,647 --> 00:38:52,241
-Hi, I'm Jay.
-And I'm Wray.

430
00:38:56,769 --> 00:39:00,604
To avoid suspicion, I think one of you
should ask me to dance.

431
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,524
-You, twinkle toes.
-All right.

432
00:39:04,131 --> 00:39:07,363
-Madam, would you care to dance?
-Love to.

433
00:39:16,134 --> 00:39:20,095
You know, I have the feeling
we've met somewhere before.

434
00:39:21,096 --> 00:39:22,734
I don't think so.

435
00:39:22,976 --> 00:39:26,492
You look familiar.
Were you in Boston two years ago?

436
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:28,533
No.

437
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,808
Funny.

438
00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:36,733
How come an attractive woman like you
ends up in a job so...

439
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,936
Raunchy?

440
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:40,980
Yeah. No, I mean dangerous.

441
00:39:43,182 --> 00:39:46,380
That's a long story.
Maybe someday I'll tell you.

442
00:39:49,544 --> 00:39:52,013
-Hello.
-You need nuts with what you're drinking.

443
00:39:52,105 --> 00:39:54,666
-Thank you.
-Mind if I sit down?

444
00:39:54,946 --> 00:39:58,622
Are you kidding? On this side.

445
00:40:06,189 --> 00:40:10,149
-Surprised to see me?
-Nothing surprises me anymore these days.

446
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,870
I was passing by and I saw you come in.

447
00:40:13,671 --> 00:40:16,630
I'm glad you did. How's your truck?

448
00:40:17,712 --> 00:40:22,583
Looking pretty. Between you and me,
I made a little extra on the insurance.

449
00:40:23,874 --> 00:40:27,265
What do you mean, "between you and me"?
It's just between you and you.

450
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:30,314
I don't wanna know
if you're screwing your insurance.

451
00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:34,390
-Who's the good-looking gal?
-She pushes an 18-wheeler.

452
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:38,909
We can't talk in front of her.

453
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,189
-I'll take care of it.
-Okay.

454
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:43,438
So you pump iron?

455
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,070
There you are.
I wanna introduce my friend...

456
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:48,435
Annabelle.

457
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:49,841
-Hello.
-Hi.

458
00:40:51,962 --> 00:40:55,752
By the way, me and Annabelle
are gonna take a moonlight ride.

459
00:40:56,244 --> 00:40:58,200
I didn't know you were such a romantic.

460
00:40:58,284 --> 00:41:01,914
Really? There's a lot of things
you don't know about me.

461
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:04,722
Nice meeting you, Irene.

462
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:12,557
-Hey, is this yours?
-Sure is.

463
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:23,285
You're not gonna tell me you use this
easy-to-park little compact all the time.

464
00:41:23,372 --> 00:41:25,044
Always. Get in.

465
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:27,931
You'll find it's a lot more comfortable
than a Rolls-Royce.

466
00:41:28,013 --> 00:41:30,084
-Am I gonna be safe?
-Who knows?

467
00:41:30,174 --> 00:41:32,529
-I'll risk it.
-I've got some great tapes.

468
00:41:32,614 --> 00:41:36,654
I hear you're interested in finding out
about a certain corpse: Garret's.

469
00:41:36,735 --> 00:41:39,489
How did you know about it?
It's supposed to be top-secret.

470
00:41:39,576 --> 00:41:42,614
-The ways of the Lord--
-Are infinite, I know.

471
00:41:42,977 --> 00:41:44,696
So, what have you got for me?

472
00:41:44,778 --> 00:41:48,294
Garret, while he was in Miami,
met a man named Fletcher.

473
00:41:48,499 --> 00:41:52,095
-Who's he?
-Florida's major wheeler-dealer.

474
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,177
-What's his gig?
-Gambling. Anything illegal.

475
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:02,453
-So how do I get to him?
-I heard through the grapevine.

476
00:42:02,543 --> 00:42:06,059
He intends turning the Orange Bowl game
between Washington and Oklahoma...

477
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:09,023
-into the biggest rip-off of the year.
-How?

478
00:42:09,385 --> 00:42:14,255
Rumour has it he intends kidnapping
the Washington quarterback, Joe Ranieri...

479
00:42:14,346 --> 00:42:17,578
-just for the day.
-Come on, that's hard to believe.

480
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:21,423
Anyway, it won't cost you anything
to keep Joe Ranieri under surveillance.

481
00:42:21,509 --> 00:42:23,625
-I've been thinking--
-Yeah, I know.

482
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:27,259
Foil the kidnapping, catch Fletcher,
and give him the third degree.

483
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,500
Right.

484
00:42:29,191 --> 00:42:30,260
Then let's go for it.

485
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,314
I don't understand a single word,
but what a voice.

486
00:43:05,241 --> 00:43:08,518
It really reaches me all over. You, too?

487
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:52,533
Like I told you on the phone...

488
00:43:52,615 --> 00:43:55,688
Joe Ranieri does not ride on the bus
with the rest of the team.

489
00:43:55,776 --> 00:43:58,814
He's superstitious.
He goes in the limo with me.

490
00:43:58,897 --> 00:44:01,537
Okay, no problem. We're the same size.

491
00:44:02,058 --> 00:44:04,778
-You guys got a plan for this?
-Sure.

492
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:06,292
Can I hear it?

493
00:44:06,379 --> 00:44:10,214
Well, it's very simple.
If someone wants something from you...

494
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:15,417
the important thing is to be sure that
something is where someone can't find it.

495
00:44:16,502 --> 00:44:17,696
Get it?

496
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:42,503
Mr. Fletcher...

497
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,345
this is the betting situation
up to about three minutes ago!

498
00:44:51,032 --> 00:44:53,308
Looks like we're all gonna retire, boys.

499
00:44:53,393 --> 00:44:56,113
Eight figures. Zero, zero, zero.

500
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,760
-They're behind us.
-Great.

501
00:46:02,973 --> 00:46:06,205
-Go on, gun it!
-But, sir, what's going on here?

502
00:46:07,655 --> 00:46:09,452
Come on, burn rubber.

503
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:15,856
You drive.

504
00:46:16,097 --> 00:46:17,416
Move over.

505
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:22,771
-This is not a Ferrari.
-It is now.

506
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:44,035
Car 21 to Station.

507
00:47:44,283 --> 00:47:47,196
Stand by, we're almost there.
You've got three minutes.

508
00:47:51,565 --> 00:47:53,157
Okay, slow down.

509
00:48:17,332 --> 00:48:18,607
Let's go.

510
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:38,337
All right. The play is over, you guys.

511
00:48:39,139 --> 00:48:40,970
It's too hot to fight.

512
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,928
Hold it.

513
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:48,293
Here come the troops, fellows.
They'll take you to the showers.

514
00:48:57,104 --> 00:49:00,859
Mr. Fletcher, we've gone way past
the $10-million mark.

515
00:49:15,549 --> 00:49:17,745
<i>Before the start of the game...</i>

516
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:20,863
<i>there'll be a presentation
of the Robert Delmann Award...</i>

517
00:49:20,951 --> 00:49:23,750
<i>to Joe Ranieri,
the best quarterback of the year.</i>

518
00:49:23,832 --> 00:49:26,984
<i>And here comes Joe now.
Let's hear that applause.</i>

519
00:49:27,913 --> 00:49:29,711
Who the hell is that?

520
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:31,747
Ranieri's there.

521
00:49:32,274 --> 00:49:35,790
-Where did those guys screw it up?
-Something must've gone wrong, boss.

522
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:38,310
Something? You mental retard, we're ruined.

523
00:49:38,396 --> 00:49:40,672
Something upsetting you, Mr. Fletcher?

524
00:49:40,957 --> 00:49:43,677
Who the hell are you guys,
and what do you want?

525
00:49:43,758 --> 00:49:46,750
-We want to talk to you.
-The rest stay here and enjoy the game.

526
00:50:07,765 --> 00:50:10,040
It looks like Washington just scored.

527
00:50:10,165 --> 00:50:13,681
That's bad news. Right, Mr. Fletcher?
What did Garret want from you?

528
00:50:13,766 --> 00:50:16,600
Who's Garret? Who are you guys anyway?
I want my attorney.

529
00:50:16,687 --> 00:50:19,885
Come on, you jackass, start thinking.
Get over there!

530
00:50:19,968 --> 00:50:22,324
What are you doing?
I don't even know the guy!

531
00:50:22,409 --> 00:50:23,683
We have proof that you did.

532
00:50:23,769 --> 00:50:25,681
-I didn't know--
-You didn't know what?

533
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:28,808
What's the difference?
I'm not a stool pigeon. You guys are--

534
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:34,889
We can arrest you for illegal betting
and kidnapping.

535
00:50:34,973 --> 00:50:37,851
They'll lock you up and throw away the key.

536
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:40,967
What if I talk?

537
00:50:44,295 --> 00:50:46,935
We won't report you
for the kidnapping attempt.

538
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:49,770
-Right, Steve?
-Absolutely, Doug.

539
00:50:50,137 --> 00:50:51,411
Hold on.

540
00:50:51,777 --> 00:50:55,009
Any way you look at it, I'm clean.
I didn't know Garret.

541
00:50:55,098 --> 00:50:57,693
And I don't know how he knew me.
Everybody knows me.

542
00:50:57,779 --> 00:50:59,293
But he made me a crazy offer.

543
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,099
He said if I'd help him find a guy
named Ralph Duran...

544
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:05,173
that he thinks is in Miami now
living under a different name...

545
00:51:05,261 --> 00:51:07,935
we could split $20 million.

546
00:51:08,102 --> 00:51:11,778
$20 million, that's a lot of money.
But I told him to get out...

547
00:51:11,863 --> 00:51:15,493
because I don't go for those sneaky,
dirty things, really.

548
00:51:16,425 --> 00:51:18,495
Well, maybe not that dirty.

549
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,225
What about Ralph Duran?

550
00:51:21,306 --> 00:51:24,299
The first time I ever heard his name...

551
00:51:24,747 --> 00:51:27,740
was when Garret gave it to me.
That's the truth. First time.

552
00:51:27,828 --> 00:51:29,899
Okay? Can I go now?

553
00:51:30,269 --> 00:51:32,225
-Sure.
-Thanks a lot. I could--

554
00:51:36,871 --> 00:51:40,148
Do we look like the kind of cops
who'd make a deal?

555
00:51:41,392 --> 00:51:43,907
-Right, Steve?
-Absolutely, Doug.

556
00:51:48,394 --> 00:51:51,512
Well, for once,
Fletcher appears to be telling the truth.

557
00:51:51,595 --> 00:51:55,714
There's nothing in the file to indicate
he had anything to do with Ralph Duran.

558
00:51:55,796 --> 00:51:58,265
But here's where the plot thickens.

559
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:01,948
"Ralph Duran, highly dangerous...

560
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:04,872
"suspected of various murders
and robberies.

561
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:08,999
"On March 5, 1978, his body was found
in a Detroit garbage dump...

562
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,231
"burned beyond recognition.

563
00:52:11,401 --> 00:52:12,595
"There was no prints.

564
00:52:12,681 --> 00:52:16,277
"The only identifiable thing
was a scorched credit card."

565
00:52:17,442 --> 00:52:20,321
Credit card? If you ask me, I smell a rat.

566
00:52:20,683 --> 00:52:24,040
-Yeah. A crook with credit cards?
-Right.

567
00:52:24,645 --> 00:52:26,124
Wait a minute.

568
00:52:26,485 --> 00:52:30,195
The robbery took place on March 1, 1978.

569
00:52:30,766 --> 00:52:33,679
We arrested Garret two days later.
You remember that?

570
00:52:33,767 --> 00:52:35,326
Sure, March 3.

571
00:52:35,448 --> 00:52:39,203
And then Duran's body
was found on March 5.

572
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:42,728
With his record,
he could have been in with Garret.

573
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:46,922
Remember, the witnesses said
that there were three robbers.

574
00:52:47,051 --> 00:52:49,282
Duran's dead. Garret's dead.

575
00:52:50,212 --> 00:52:52,204
Number three is your man.

576
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:55,850
Yeah, but why would Garret
be looking for a stiff?

577
00:52:55,934 --> 00:52:57,162
It doesn't make sense.

578
00:52:57,254 --> 00:53:01,089
It don't make sense with me, either.
So you handle it, Blue Eyes.

579
00:53:01,255 --> 00:53:05,215
I would've been better off
if I'd stayed with my flying classes.

580
00:53:09,058 --> 00:53:12,608
Three, four, five...

581
00:53:13,979 --> 00:53:15,571
six... It's open.

582
00:53:19,621 --> 00:53:20,610
Hi.

583
00:53:23,862 --> 00:53:25,739
-Hi.
-I'm early, huh?

584
00:53:25,822 --> 00:53:29,703
No, I always do 100 lifts before dinner.
Builds up my appetite.

585
00:53:29,784 --> 00:53:32,617
Pour yourself a drink. We can eat anytime.

586
00:53:33,185 --> 00:53:36,302
-I'll take a fast shower and be right back.
-Okay.

587
00:54:14,757 --> 00:54:16,952
Smells great. I'm starving.

588
00:54:17,197 --> 00:54:20,315
-If you came here to eat and run--
-Of course not.

589
00:54:20,398 --> 00:54:22,629
I never run on a full stomach.

590
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,839
Listen, Irene...

591
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,594
from the very first moment I saw you--

592
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,434
Don't tell me. You fell in love with me.

593
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:33,800
Well, that wouldn't be too hard.

594
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:37,472
No. What I wanted to say is...

595
00:54:37,563 --> 00:54:40,237
from the minute I saw you,
I felt like I'd met you before.

596
00:54:40,324 --> 00:54:44,318
And now I know where:
the Demolition Derby in Tucson last year.

597
00:54:44,405 --> 00:54:46,203
The Demolition Derby?

598
00:54:47,006 --> 00:54:48,679
-Remember?
-No way.

599
00:54:49,647 --> 00:54:50,682
No?

600
00:54:53,128 --> 00:54:56,087
-The door.
-That's the timer. Dinner's ready.

601
00:54:56,689 --> 00:54:58,646
The Indianapolis 500?

602
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:03,403
I haven't been there in 10 years.
It'll come back to you sooner or later.

603
00:55:06,972 --> 00:55:08,803
Hey, you're pretty good.

604
00:55:08,892 --> 00:55:11,043
You bet. I'm gonna get you.

605
00:55:12,293 --> 00:55:15,445
You're the first man to beat me
at arm wrestling.

606
00:55:15,815 --> 00:55:18,488
Well, you're tougher than Mighty Mouse.

607
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:24,496
You can't imagine
how important that is to me.

608
00:55:24,577 --> 00:55:27,046
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Squeeze me.

609
00:55:27,258 --> 00:55:29,055
-Squeeze me tight.
-What?

610
00:55:29,138 --> 00:55:31,494
-Squeeze me tight.
-Like so?

611
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:33,377
No. Tighter.

612
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,736
-Tighter.
-You know I could break you in two?

613
00:55:37,821 --> 00:55:39,778
No, you won't. I love it.

614
00:55:41,462 --> 00:55:42,781
Excuse me.

615
00:55:47,864 --> 00:55:50,982
<i>Steve, a guy named Charro called
looking for you.</i>

616
00:55:51,065 --> 00:55:55,344
<i>He wants you to call him back
at this number: 473-8329.</i>

617
00:55:55,546 --> 00:55:56,774
<i>I checked it out.</i>

618
00:55:56,866 --> 00:55:59,859
<i>It's a public phone booth
in the Miccosukee district.</i>

619
00:56:00,948 --> 00:56:04,146
473-8329. Yeah, I got it.

620
00:56:04,709 --> 00:56:08,339
Yes, hi to you, too, paleface.
Something's just come up.

621
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:12,386
Maybe it's important, maybe it's not.
I'll be waiting for you.

622
00:56:23,434 --> 00:56:24,914
Here's to you.

623
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:28,384
Which me: the informer or the cook?

624
00:56:28,596 --> 00:56:30,507
-All of you.
-Thank you.

625
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:41,714
Why don't you tell me all the places
you've been in the last two years?

626
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,075
Well, I spent a year in Philly.

627
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,039
That's it. Philadelphia.

628
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,592
I've never been to Philadelphia.

629
00:56:57,004 --> 00:56:59,758
-Don't answer it.
-It might be important.

630
00:57:00,765 --> 00:57:02,404
I know who it is.

631
00:57:03,246 --> 00:57:04,565
Answer it.

632
00:57:07,887 --> 00:57:09,480
Yes, right away. It's for you.

633
00:57:09,568 --> 00:57:11,320
<i>-It's that pain.
-Jack.</i>

634
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:12,798
That's you.

635
00:57:19,451 --> 00:57:22,204
The other day, shortly after you left...

636
00:57:22,531 --> 00:57:24,966
I received this. It's from Garret.

637
00:57:28,733 --> 00:57:31,043
"The eagle assures your future."

638
00:57:31,734 --> 00:57:33,487
What does that mean?

639
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,884
I thought about it for three days.

640
00:57:35,975 --> 00:57:37,728
One thing's for sure.

641
00:57:37,816 --> 00:57:41,651
The letter, the screwdriver, and the hammer
are all connected.

642
00:57:42,857 --> 00:57:45,167
"The eagle assures your future."

643
00:57:45,818 --> 00:57:47,332
I don't get it.

644
00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:52,456
When we do get it,
we'll have the key to the mystery.

645
00:57:53,701 --> 00:57:56,899
When you saw Garret alive,
you don't think maybe...

646
00:57:56,982 --> 00:57:58,176
No way.

647
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:01,457
Here, take them. They are the clues.

648
00:58:01,743 --> 00:58:03,415
And another thing.

649
00:58:04,224 --> 00:58:07,581
Garret said the guy he was looking for
had a face-lift.

650
00:58:08,225 --> 00:58:11,616
Come on, the guy he was looking for
died seven years ago.

651
00:58:11,706 --> 00:58:15,541
There's an old Indian saying:
"Not all the dead are buried underground."

652
00:58:15,627 --> 00:58:16,696
Sure.

653
00:58:16,787 --> 00:58:19,825
Some get buried at sea,
some get burned up.

654
00:58:23,189 --> 00:58:24,509
Burned up.

655
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:26,623
Yeah, burned.

656
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,066
Hey, wait a minute.

657
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:38,028
Coming.

658
00:58:40,834 --> 00:58:42,587
-Who is it?
-It's me.

659
00:58:44,075 --> 00:58:46,306
-Hi.
-I'm glad you could come back.

660
00:58:48,277 --> 00:58:51,873
Sorry, but I need the names
of all the plastic surgeons...

661
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:54,711
who worked in Florida from '77 to '78.

662
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:56,472
-Now?
-Yes.

663
00:58:56,879 --> 00:58:59,394
But it's midnight.
I can't wake up my contacts.

664
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,596
-Please.
-All right.

665
00:59:10,963 --> 00:59:12,955
Hey, Detroit.

666
00:59:13,044 --> 00:59:15,718
A Formula One race in Detroit, right?

667
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:18,234
Never been there. Hello?

668
00:59:19,566 --> 00:59:22,285
It's got to be Danaisser.
He worked on a lot of criminals.

669
00:59:22,366 --> 00:59:25,404
And he died on March 30, 1978.

670
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:29,357
Right. That's 25 days
after Ralph Duran died.

671
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:32,043
And that's enough time
for scars to heal, right?

672
00:59:32,129 --> 00:59:35,918
What's with this saying "right" all the time?
Ain't you sure?

673
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:39,721
So it figures then that
Ralph Duran had the operation on his face...

674
00:59:39,812 --> 00:59:41,404
-and then killed the surgeon.
-Right.

675
00:59:41,492 --> 00:59:43,484
There you go with that word again.

676
00:59:43,573 --> 00:59:46,930
You know something? I get the feeling
this is a job for gravediggers...

677
00:59:47,014 --> 00:59:48,413
not for cops.

678
00:59:48,934 --> 00:59:51,768
-We keep coming up with corpses.
-Right.

679
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,371
It's an animal clinic.

680
01:00:10,621 --> 01:00:13,772
Maybe he practiced his craft
on delinquent Dobermans.

681
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:17,218
Could be. Personally,
all Dobermans look alike to me.

682
01:00:17,343 --> 01:00:18,981
All bite no bark.

683
01:00:27,946 --> 01:00:29,095
Mrs. Danaisser?

684
01:00:29,186 --> 01:00:32,145
What do you cops want?
You wanna check my license?

685
01:00:32,227 --> 01:00:35,265
No, we just wanna ask you a few questions
about your husband.

686
01:00:35,348 --> 01:00:38,546
-My husband's been dead for seven years.
-We know that, ma'am.

687
01:00:38,629 --> 01:00:41,063
We're interested in the circumstances
of his death.

688
01:00:41,149 --> 01:00:43,505
There's a coroner's report.
He was hit by a truck.

689
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:46,059
If you'll excuse me,
I've a dog who's getting an IV...

690
01:00:46,151 --> 01:00:48,028
and I have no assistants. Goodbye.

691
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:51,867
-Hey, want a hand?
-Yeah. We're trained paramedics.

692
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:54,667
Okay, Bounty, I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

693
01:00:54,753 --> 01:00:57,393
I'll take that out of there right now.

694
01:00:57,794 --> 01:01:01,026
If you wanna help me, you can go out
and feed the dogs and goats.

695
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:04,870
The dogs' food's in the yellow pail,
the goats' food's in the green pail.

696
01:01:04,956 --> 01:01:07,915
Sure. I'll feed the dogs, you feed the goats.

697
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,034
No, you feed the goats.

698
01:01:10,118 --> 01:01:12,394
I'll feed the goats, all right.

699
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:17,034
There, now you're gonna feel much better.

700
01:01:21,121 --> 01:01:24,114
These are all stray animals
abandoned on the streets.

701
01:01:24,202 --> 01:01:27,832
Of course, someone who doesn't love
animals is capable of anything.

702
01:01:27,923 --> 01:01:30,358
-Like your husband's killer.
-What do you know?

703
01:01:30,444 --> 01:01:33,357
To tell you the truth,
we don't really know anything.

704
01:01:33,445 --> 01:01:36,483
But we think the truck that hit your husband
did it deliberately.

705
01:01:36,566 --> 01:01:38,557
We want to reopen the case.

706
01:01:38,726 --> 01:01:41,605
-Seriously?
-Why do you think we're here?

707
01:01:41,687 --> 01:01:42,915
But who could it have been?

708
01:01:43,008 --> 01:01:45,442
Theoretically, all your husband's patients...

709
01:01:45,528 --> 01:01:48,248
could've had an interest
in getting rid of a witness.

710
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,523
That's true.

711
01:01:49,609 --> 01:01:52,807
Do you remember the last client
he did surgery on?

712
01:01:53,371 --> 01:01:55,760
How could I forget? Come with me.

713
01:01:58,092 --> 01:02:01,563
He paid so well,
we took a long vacation in Europe:

714
01:02:02,053 --> 01:02:04,284
London, Paris, Madrid.

715
01:02:04,374 --> 01:02:06,444
-Almost a month?
-Yes.

716
01:02:06,854 --> 01:02:09,415
And when you got back to Miami,
the accident happened?

717
01:02:09,495 --> 01:02:11,646
Exactly. Two days later.

718
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:16,486
Did your husband keep files
on his patients?

719
01:02:16,577 --> 01:02:19,570
No. But I have
all of Mel's appointment books.

720
01:02:20,338 --> 01:02:23,092
-Here, this is the one, 1978.
-Thanks.

721
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:28,053
You know, these operations were illegal.
No names, no receipts.

722
01:02:28,741 --> 01:02:30,459
Here we are. March.

723
01:02:32,262 --> 01:02:34,697
Look at this: "R.D."

724
01:02:36,783 --> 01:02:39,696
Ten'll get you a hundred that's Ralph Duran.

725
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:45,219
Ma'am, what's this "F.T." after the $75,000?

726
01:02:45,306 --> 01:02:46,864
It was a code my husband used...

727
01:02:46,946 --> 01:02:50,144
when the operation
called for a total physiognomy.

728
01:02:51,828 --> 01:02:54,820
Here you are, ma'am.
Thanks for letting us feed the animals.

729
01:02:54,908 --> 01:02:57,377
You think you can catch the killer?

730
01:02:57,549 --> 01:02:59,586
Our record's pretty good, ma'am.

731
01:03:26,278 --> 01:03:27,427
"R.D."

732
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:30,353
I bet you're thinking
the same thing I'm thinking.

733
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:33,155
Maybe Delmann's actually Duran.

734
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,833
Give him a tip.

735
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:42,081
Thanks a lot, mister. Have a nice day.

736
01:03:56,246 --> 01:03:58,238
Are you guys out of your minds?

737
01:03:58,327 --> 01:04:01,126
Delmann is probably
the most important man in this city.

738
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:03,403
He's a political heavyweight.

739
01:04:03,529 --> 01:04:08,206
He heads the Consolidated Realty
and he's a big shot over at the country club.

740
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:11,920
What about his initials?
R.D. One hell of a coincidence.

741
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:15,284
Come on, Steve,
millions of people have those same initials.

742
01:04:15,372 --> 01:04:18,126
Where does this money come from?
What's his story?

743
01:04:18,213 --> 01:04:20,568
Pretty simple.
He was expatriated out of Cuba...

744
01:04:20,654 --> 01:04:23,452
like a lot of other people,
to get away from Castro.

745
01:04:23,534 --> 01:04:26,447
-When?
-About seven years ago.

746
01:04:26,695 --> 01:04:29,768
But he's loaded.
He made a lot of money on the stock market.

747
01:04:29,856 --> 01:04:32,690
Could you get us the exact date
he got here?

748
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:38,016
April 2, 1978.

749
01:04:39,259 --> 01:04:42,093
A month after Ralph Duran's body
was found.

750
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:45,817
Coincidence number two.
Number one: the initials.

751
01:04:45,901 --> 01:04:48,700
Number two: the date of arrival in Miami.

752
01:04:49,142 --> 01:04:51,703
Just three days
after that plastic surgeon died.

753
01:04:51,783 --> 01:04:53,694
And that's coincidence number three.

754
01:04:53,783 --> 01:04:55,581
Oh, come on, you guys.

755
01:04:55,824 --> 01:04:58,133
Okay, forget it.

756
01:05:04,746 --> 01:05:07,739
We haven't got a hope in hell
of getting in there.

757
01:05:08,507 --> 01:05:10,976
All we need
are some of Delmann's fingerprints...

758
01:05:11,068 --> 01:05:12,946
to compare with Duran's.

759
01:05:13,029 --> 01:05:14,098
Good thinking.

760
01:05:14,189 --> 01:05:17,660
It's the only way to prove our theory,
once and for all.

761
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:21,710
Hey, didn't Tanney say
Delmann's chairman of the Golf Club?

762
01:05:21,991 --> 01:05:22,981
Yeah.

763
01:05:23,072 --> 01:05:25,347
His locker's gotta be loaded
with his fingerprints.

764
01:05:25,432 --> 01:05:26,866
That's right.

765
01:06:51,057 --> 01:06:52,411
Hey, Doug.

766
01:06:55,379 --> 01:06:57,654
The comb.

767
01:06:57,739 --> 01:07:02,019
-Relax, you don't have a hair out of place.
-No, I had Delmann's comb.

768
01:07:02,621 --> 01:07:05,261
Do we have any aspirin in the patrol car?

769
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:15,059
Hello?

770
01:07:15,705 --> 01:07:16,979
Speaking.

771
01:07:17,865 --> 01:07:19,060
A comb?

772
01:07:20,226 --> 01:07:21,375
I see.

773
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:26,586
Are you sure they didn't take anything else?

774
01:07:27,188 --> 01:07:28,303
I don't like it.

775
01:07:28,388 --> 01:07:31,187
This time, those two
are too close for comfort, understand?

776
01:07:36,711 --> 01:07:39,704
-Hey, sir, orange juice.
-Make it two.

777
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:15,997
We're getting close to cracking this case...

778
01:08:16,082 --> 01:08:18,916
and here we are,
cruising around in a patrol car.

779
01:08:19,003 --> 01:08:21,882
We're wasting our time. Let's do something.

780
01:08:22,244 --> 01:08:24,634
Kick off by paying for the juice.

781
01:08:26,805 --> 01:08:29,718
Look, I forgot my wallet again.

782
01:08:29,886 --> 01:08:33,084
Will you take care of this
and I'll pay you back?

783
01:08:33,287 --> 01:08:35,358
He forgot his wallet again.

784
01:08:37,248 --> 01:08:39,888
You're lucky it's me and not a mugger.

785
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:42,120
Come on, tightwad, let's go.

786
01:09:13,699 --> 01:09:15,577
Hey! Help.

787
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:18,015
You come back here with my bag!

788
01:09:54,671 --> 01:09:55,945
Lucky.

789
01:09:57,712 --> 01:09:59,748
Mister, was that your car?

790
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:05,463
Beat it before the cops get here.

791
01:10:05,674 --> 01:10:07,586
The man said beat it!

792
01:10:14,317 --> 01:10:16,069
I just can't believe it.

793
01:10:16,157 --> 01:10:18,228
Delmann might be capable of a lot of things.

794
01:10:18,318 --> 01:10:20,628
But we're talking
about attempted murder here.

795
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:23,836
If Delmann's our man,
that's right up his alley.

796
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,317
I think he's writing us a letter.

797
01:10:27,401 --> 01:10:29,517
Let's forget about the initials for now.

798
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:31,797
But not the way
he just turned up in the city.

799
01:10:31,882 --> 01:10:33,110
And now a bomb...

800
01:10:33,202 --> 01:10:37,116
put in our car the day after
we tried to lift his fingerprints.

801
01:10:37,884 --> 01:10:40,318
But how does Delmann know
you want his fingerprints?

802
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:43,761
Well, some guy almost killed me
to get his comb back.

803
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:47,119
Listen, Chief, we need a search warrant.

804
01:10:47,446 --> 01:10:50,883
If you give us that,
we'll give you Duran on a platter.

805
01:10:51,087 --> 01:10:54,046
No, guys. It's too big.

806
01:10:54,448 --> 01:10:56,519
If you blow it, we're dead.

807
01:10:56,609 --> 01:10:59,568
What if we come up with proof
that will nail him?

808
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:00,878
Such as?

809
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:04,489
Check the computer
and see if anybody at the Golf Club...

810
01:11:04,571 --> 01:11:07,370
reported an attempted robbery last night.

811
01:11:15,575 --> 01:11:17,327
No, it's a negative report.

812
01:11:17,415 --> 01:11:19,611
Don't you think that's funny?

813
01:11:20,256 --> 01:11:21,450
Well, Tom?

814
01:11:21,536 --> 01:11:24,495
God help us all,
I wanna make one thing perfectly clear.

815
01:11:24,577 --> 01:11:26,296
I'm not giving you a search warrant.

816
01:11:26,378 --> 01:11:28,653
You can work it
as a couple of private citizens...

817
01:11:28,738 --> 01:11:31,537
but I don't wanna know anything about it.

818
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:37,092
There's been too many corpses already.
So remember, no more blood.

819
01:11:43,863 --> 01:11:46,936
Friends, may I have your attention, please?

820
01:11:49,464 --> 01:11:53,220
In addition to my past contributions
to the city of Miami...

821
01:11:53,346 --> 01:11:55,098
I am proud to announce...

822
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:58,941
that this will be
Miami's biggest ever construction project.

823
01:11:59,027 --> 01:12:02,782
And I could never have done it
without your help. Thank you.

824
01:12:21,154 --> 01:12:22,553
What a nuisance.

825
01:12:22,634 --> 01:12:26,389
They should ban helicopters
from flying over residential areas.

826
01:13:15,009 --> 01:13:17,240
How dare you interrupt my party!

827
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:20,323
-You'll pay for this.
-Sure. Bill my partner.

828
01:13:20,411 --> 01:13:22,528
Who? Who are you, anyway?

829
01:13:23,812 --> 01:13:25,849
Can we have a little talk?

830
01:13:27,693 --> 01:13:30,367
Come into the house. Excuse me, please.

831
01:13:33,255 --> 01:13:34,973
Take a seat, please.

832
01:13:41,737 --> 01:13:44,332
Take the chair. It looks stronger.

833
01:13:46,659 --> 01:13:49,970
The only excuse
I can find for you gentlemen...

834
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,455
is that you're from a loony farm.

835
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:53,860
What do you want?

836
01:13:53,941 --> 01:13:56,456
We wanna tell you a piece of old history.

837
01:13:56,542 --> 01:13:58,737
Just to see how good your memory is.

838
01:13:58,822 --> 01:14:00,051
Eight years ago...

839
01:14:00,143 --> 01:14:04,342
three bandits held up
the Detroit Federal Bank for $20 million.

840
01:14:05,104 --> 01:14:06,173
And?

841
01:14:07,825 --> 01:14:10,943
We caught one of them.
Only one of them: Garret.

842
01:14:11,466 --> 01:14:13,697
But he wouldn't rat on anyone.

843
01:14:14,547 --> 01:14:16,742
Very interesting. Continue.

844
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:19,388
Then Garret got out of jail
and came here to Miami...

845
01:14:19,468 --> 01:14:23,178
to find his friend, Ralph Duran,
and his share in the robbery.

846
01:14:23,269 --> 01:14:24,988
Garret found Duran.

847
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:29,748
But Duran had a new face and a new name,
and the same old killer instinct.

848
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:31,743
You can guess what happened next.

849
01:14:31,832 --> 01:14:35,621
They found Garret's body
with 6 inches of cold steel in it.

850
01:14:35,993 --> 01:14:39,748
And we're convinced
that Ralph Duran lives in this mansion...

851
01:14:39,834 --> 01:14:42,952
and is sitting in front of us.
Right, Mr. Duran?

852
01:14:44,476 --> 01:14:47,867
Fantastic. It's a bad joke.

853
01:14:48,437 --> 01:14:51,794
You should be fiction writers.
You're wasted as cops.

854
01:14:53,598 --> 01:14:55,317
I'm gonna ruin you.

855
01:14:55,519 --> 01:14:57,316
Oh, yeah? Look at me.

856
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:00,069
I'm trembling all over, sir.

857
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,354
-I'll give you a chance to ruin us.
-How?

858
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:07,956
We wanna take your fingerprints
and see if they match Duran's.

859
01:15:08,242 --> 01:15:11,360
-If we're wrong, you can bury us.
-Okay with me.

860
01:15:11,523 --> 01:15:13,879
I've got nothing against
you taking my prints.

861
01:15:13,964 --> 01:15:16,354
But first, I'd like to make a call.

862
01:15:29,489 --> 01:15:31,002
<i>Miami Police Dept. Can I help you?</i>

863
01:15:31,089 --> 01:15:33,923
Robert Delmann speaking.
Get me Mr. Risner.

864
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:36,566
He's the Police Commissioner.

865
01:15:36,971 --> 01:15:39,327
<i>My dear Robert, what can I do for you?</i>

866
01:15:39,412 --> 01:15:42,484
Joe, two of your men are in my house...

867
01:15:42,573 --> 01:15:45,565
with some cockamamie story
about me not being myself...

868
01:15:45,653 --> 01:15:47,724
but some hood named Duran.

869
01:15:47,814 --> 01:15:49,726
A bank robber, a killer.

870
01:15:49,855 --> 01:15:52,005
<i>-What?
-There's more.</i>

871
01:15:52,095 --> 01:15:55,088
I believe these two are the crooks
who broke into my locker...

872
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:56,849
at the Golf Club the other night.

873
01:15:56,937 --> 01:15:59,531
I didn't report it then, so I'll do it now.

874
01:15:59,617 --> 01:16:03,214
<i>This is outrageous, Robert.
You have my utmost apologies.</i>

875
01:16:03,299 --> 01:16:06,496
They insist on fingerprinting me.
Don't ask me why.

876
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:08,855
Naturally, I'm more than willing
to cooperate.

877
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:13,059
But I shall make a formal complaint
to the City, suing for damages.

878
01:16:13,982 --> 01:16:16,701
I'm telling you all this
because you're an old friend.

879
01:16:16,782 --> 01:16:19,934
Unfortunately, these jokers
are gonna cost you some headaches...

880
01:16:20,023 --> 01:16:21,935
what with the elections coming up.

881
01:16:22,024 --> 01:16:24,823
<i>Yes, of course. Put those two on the line.</i>

882
01:16:24,905 --> 01:16:26,623
Go ahead, they can hear you.

883
01:16:26,705 --> 01:16:28,458
<i>Identify yourselves.</i>

884
01:16:28,746 --> 01:16:31,500
Officer Jay Donnel, Hialeah Department.

885
01:16:32,347 --> 01:16:34,339
Officer L.A. Wray, ditto.

886
01:16:34,428 --> 01:16:37,944
<i>Get back to your precinct
and consider yourselves under arrest.</i>

887
01:16:38,029 --> 01:16:40,908
<i>Tell Tanney I'll be in his office
in half an hour.</i>

888
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:45,469
This country can boast of having
the greatest constitution in the world.

889
01:16:45,551 --> 01:16:50,103
And you harass this city's
most influential and illustrious citizen.

890
01:16:50,392 --> 01:16:52,270
I'm amazed at you, Tanney.

891
01:16:52,353 --> 01:16:55,551
I don't need to tell you
I expect your resignation.

892
01:16:55,634 --> 01:16:58,672
And you two,
hand in your uniforms and badges.

893
01:16:58,755 --> 01:17:01,350
I've already notified your superiors.

894
01:17:01,596 --> 01:17:04,873
They'll be taking the necessary action
against you.

895
01:17:05,117 --> 01:17:06,470
That's all.

896
01:17:08,278 --> 01:17:09,711
Sorry, Chief.

897
01:17:11,038 --> 01:17:14,475
It's my fault, too.
We tried. It just didn't work out.

898
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:16,549
Thanks.

899
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,190
It's people like Delmann
that make the world a garbage dump.

900
01:17:20,281 --> 01:17:24,116
I'm off the force, huh?
I'm going back to my helicopters.

901
01:17:31,164 --> 01:17:33,281
Hello, Mrs. Clay. Can I help you?

902
01:17:33,365 --> 01:17:36,278
We were just passing by,
so I said to the children:

903
01:17:36,366 --> 01:17:39,279
"Let's go in and thank those two angels."

904
01:17:39,847 --> 01:17:41,439
Donnel and Wray?

905
01:17:41,727 --> 01:17:44,083
Right now, they need all the gratitude
they can get.

906
01:17:44,168 --> 01:17:47,161
-Why is that?
-You see, they had a problem last week.

907
01:17:48,049 --> 01:17:49,608
Here's the lot.

908
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:53,047
If it makes any difference,
the men are on your side.

909
01:17:56,572 --> 01:17:59,211
Excuse me. I'm Mrs. Clay.

910
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:03,291
I heard about what happened,
and I'm really sorry.

911
01:18:03,374 --> 01:18:06,572
The children and I wanted to thank you
for what you did.

912
01:18:06,655 --> 01:18:09,044
-Yeah, sure.
-Take care, kids.

913
01:18:09,655 --> 01:18:11,009
Good luck.

914
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:13,293
-And chin up, ma'am.
-Thank you.

915
01:18:14,537 --> 01:18:17,769
Now you know why I quit the Bureau.
It's all politics.

916
01:18:17,858 --> 01:18:20,327
At least we did something
for the Clay family.

917
01:18:20,419 --> 01:18:21,534
Hey, taxi.

918
01:18:33,502 --> 01:18:35,698
<i>You wanna say adios to Irene?</i>

919
01:18:37,544 --> 01:18:40,661
No, I don't think so. What about Annabelle?

920
01:18:41,465 --> 01:18:44,776
Are you kidding?
I'm not in the mood to arm-wrestle.

921
01:18:46,106 --> 01:18:49,895
Let's just go and get our bags
and then head straight for the airport.

922
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:04,589
Hey, that sign!

923
01:19:06,872 --> 01:19:09,341
"The eagle assures your future."

924
01:19:09,633 --> 01:19:11,704
That bird's outside Room 5.

925
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,472
Turn around, immediately.

926
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:24,192
What the hell is going on here?

927
01:19:25,037 --> 01:19:28,269
What is with you... I like your nerve!

928
01:19:38,321 --> 01:19:41,473
Fellows, if you know how to pray,
now's the time.

929
01:19:51,605 --> 01:19:52,800
Charro.

930
01:19:55,126 --> 01:19:56,526
There it is.

931
01:20:19,573 --> 01:20:23,169
Now we know why he needed
the hammer and the screwdriver.

932
01:20:24,415 --> 01:20:25,734
All right!

933
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,614
Thanks, Charro. We'll be right back.

934
01:20:47,381 --> 01:20:48,576
Listen, Chief.

935
01:20:48,662 --> 01:20:50,972
Aren't you guys supposed to be
on an airplane?

936
01:20:51,063 --> 01:20:53,099
Your resignation, did you hand it in?

937
01:20:53,183 --> 01:20:56,460
No, I just got to writing it.
I'm gonna turn it in tomorrow.

938
01:20:56,544 --> 01:20:58,934
-Well, don't.
-Why? What's going on?

939
01:20:59,025 --> 01:21:03,224
Listen, by the time we've finished,
it'll be Risner's ass, not yours.

940
01:21:07,187 --> 01:21:08,701
Excuse me, sir.

941
01:21:09,228 --> 01:21:10,661
What is it, Ramon?

942
01:21:10,748 --> 01:21:13,627
This special delivery just arrived for you.

943
01:21:14,109 --> 01:21:15,145
Thank you.

944
01:21:15,230 --> 01:21:17,505
-May I?
-I'm finished. Thank you.

945
01:22:02,563 --> 01:22:03,883
<i>Hi, Ralph.</i>

946
01:22:04,204 --> 01:22:07,038
<i>Your charred body was found March, 1978.</i>

947
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:08,956
<i>But you and I know it wasn't you.</i>

948
01:22:09,045 --> 01:22:11,435
<i>It was our unlucky partner, Phillips.</i>

949
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:15,202
<i>We heard in the pen he disappeared
the same time your body was found.</i>

950
01:22:15,287 --> 01:22:18,007
<i>You always used to talk about Florida
and disappearing...</i>

951
01:22:18,088 --> 01:22:22,241
<i>and doing a plastic job on your face.
And who lived in Miami back then?</i>

952
01:22:22,329 --> 01:22:25,049
<i>The number one
underground plastic surgeon, Danaisser.</i>

953
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:28,601
<i>It was only a month after your,
excuse me, Phillips' cremation...</i>

954
01:22:28,691 --> 01:22:30,648
<i>that a truck blew Danaisser away.</i>

955
01:22:30,732 --> 01:22:33,724
<i>Very neat, Ralph. Right off, I figured you...</i>

956
01:22:52,338 --> 01:22:53,487
Who is it?

957
01:22:53,578 --> 01:22:56,651
Right now, I bet
you're even paler than usual, paleface.

958
01:22:56,739 --> 01:23:00,779
If you want the original of that tape,
come and get it, when and where I say...

959
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:04,058
and with $10 million,
plus eight years' interest...

960
01:23:04,141 --> 01:23:06,098
<i>which makes an even $20 million.</i>

961
01:23:06,182 --> 01:23:09,812
<i>-And if I don't show?
-You'll show. This is blackmail.</i>

962
01:23:10,823 --> 01:23:14,021
Any tricks,
and I'll send the original to the FBI...

963
01:23:14,104 --> 01:23:18,497
with a note suggesting they match your
fingerprints with those in Duran's old file.

964
01:23:18,586 --> 01:23:20,224
$20 million is a lot of money.

965
01:23:20,306 --> 01:23:24,266
You have eight hours to put it together.
We meet at 10:00 tonight.

966
01:23:24,347 --> 01:23:26,464
The Yankee Company's portside warehouse.

967
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:28,140
Naturally, you'll come alone.

968
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:38,746
Ramon, I want all the men in my office
within a half hour.

969
01:24:28,966 --> 01:24:30,320
Kill him!

970
01:24:30,407 --> 01:24:33,319
What are you waiting for?
Turn on the lights!

971
01:25:05,057 --> 01:25:08,095
-Damn. I thought so.
-Look, I'll give you the money.

972
01:25:08,178 --> 01:25:10,214
Yeah, so will Santa Claus.

973
01:25:25,823 --> 01:25:28,018
You're a mean shot, paleface.

974
01:25:31,344 --> 01:25:33,336
They must be out of ammo.

975
01:25:33,905 --> 01:25:36,022
Come on, let's go round behind them.

976
01:27:38,621 --> 01:27:39,816
Come on.

977
01:28:18,193 --> 01:28:20,344
Talk about a shocking sight.

978
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:26,469
Boss. Come on, let's get out of here.

979
01:29:09,448 --> 01:29:11,086
Lots of deadwood.

980
01:29:20,291 --> 01:29:22,089
Chief, what happened?

981
01:29:22,252 --> 01:29:24,846
The next time,
I don't want just a bulletproof vest.

982
01:29:24,932 --> 01:29:27,811
-I want a crash helmet, too.
-Where's Duran?

983
01:29:28,814 --> 01:29:31,807
I have no idea,
but he didn't bring the money.

984
01:29:32,055 --> 01:29:33,807
It ain't surprising.

985
01:29:42,858 --> 01:29:46,932
-Let's see how you get out of this.
-Don't kill me. Name your price.

986
01:29:47,019 --> 01:29:48,168
Maybe.

987
01:29:48,659 --> 01:29:52,209
Maybe I'll give you a second face-lift.
No charge.

988
01:30:01,783 --> 01:30:04,344
This is your lucky day, Duran.

989
01:30:32,352 --> 01:30:33,627
Hi, Chief.

990
01:30:34,393 --> 01:30:36,304
The 52nd floor.

991
01:30:36,713 --> 01:30:41,027
That's where I saw you. The 52nd floor
of the FBI building in New York.

992
01:30:42,835 --> 01:30:44,792
Special Agent Irene Allen.

993
01:30:44,876 --> 01:30:47,391
I was sent to Miami to act as your cover...

994
01:30:47,477 --> 01:30:51,437
and I just couldn't miss the ending
of your brilliant operation.

995
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:54,469
This is really too good to be true.

996
01:30:54,559 --> 01:30:56,993
But I thought I told you no blood.

997
01:30:57,199 --> 01:30:59,430
Come on, this is tomato sauce.

998
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:05,034
Well, you've got to go
make a little visit now.

999
01:31:05,122 --> 01:31:06,316
Where?

1000
01:31:06,402 --> 01:31:09,759
You've got a score to settle.
Your friend, Com. Risner.

1001
01:31:22,207 --> 01:31:24,596
Well, Doug, I enjoyed every minute.

1002
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:27,839
But next time, I won't let you trick me
into helping you again.

1003
01:31:27,928 --> 01:31:31,399
So your mind's made up?
You're going back to your flying lessons?

1004
01:31:31,489 --> 01:31:33,162
If I still got my students.

1005
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,081
Well, good luck.

1006
01:31:40,332 --> 01:31:42,051
I forgot my wallet.

1007
