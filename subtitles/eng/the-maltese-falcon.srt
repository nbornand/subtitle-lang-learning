2
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,055
Yes, sweetheart?

3
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,779
A girl wants to see you.
Her name's Wonderly.

4
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,690
A customer?

5
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,817
I guess so. You'll want to see her, anyway.
She's a knockout.

6
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,289
Shoo her in, Effie, darling. Shoo her in!

7
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,130
Will you come in, Miss Wonderly?

8
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,654
Thank you.

9
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,453
- Won't you sit down, Miss Wonderly?
- Thank you.

10
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,134
I inquired at the hotel
for a reliable private detective.

11
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,369
They mentioned you.

12
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,293
Suppose you tell me about it
from the very beginning.

13
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,972
I'm from New York.

14
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,617
I'm trying to find my sister.

15
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,776
I believe she's here in San Francisco...

16
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,658
...with a man by the name of Thursby,
Floyd Thursby.

17
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,737
I don't know where she met him.

18
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,579
We've never been as close
as sisters ought to be.

19
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,056
If we had, Corinne would have told me
she was running away with him.

20
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,337
Our parents are in Honolulu.
I must find her before they return.

21
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,378
- They'll be back on the first.
- You've had word of your sister?

22
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,610
A letter from her about two weeks ago.

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,009
It said nothing except
that she was all right.

24
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,170
I sent a telegram begging her
to come home.

25
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,058
I sent it to a general delivery address,
the one she gave.

26
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,530
I waited a week and no answer came
so I decided to come out here myself.

27
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,418
I wrote her that I was coming.
I shouldn't have, should I?

28
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,775
It's not always easy to know what to do.

29
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,174
You haven't found her?

30
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,173
No. I wrote in my letter that I'd be at
the St. Mark and for her to meet me there.

31
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,889
I waited three days. She didn't come.
She didn't even send a message.

32
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,177
It was horrible. Waiting.

33
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,458
I sent her another letter.

34
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,770
Yesterday afternoon
I went to the post office.

35
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,932
Corinne didn't call for her mail,
but Floyd Thursby did.

36
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,290
He wouldn't tell me where Corinne was.

37
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,371
He said she didn't want to see me.

38
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,893
I can't believe that.

39
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,494
He promised to bring her to the hotel
if she'd come.

40
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,970
He said he knew she wouldn't.
He promised to come if she didn't.

41
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,249
Excuse me.

42
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,690
It's all right, Miles. Come in.

43
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,095
Miss Wonderly, my partner, Miles Archer.

44
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,971
Miss Wonderly's sister ran away
with a fellow named Thursby.

45
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,732
They're here in San Francisco.

46
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,015
Miss Wonderly has a date
with Thursby tonight.

47
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,739
Maybe he'll bring the sister.
The chances are he won't.

48
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,529
Miss Wonderly wants us to find the sister,
get her away from him and back home.

49
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,939
- Right?
- Yes.

50
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,652
Now it's simply a matter of having a man
at the hotel tonight...

51
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,049
...to shadow him when he leads us
to your sister.

52
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,098
Lf, after we've found her,
she still won't leave him...

53
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,615
...well, we have ways of managing that.

54
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,015
You must be careful.

55
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,489
I'm deathly afraid of him,
of what he might do.

56
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,219
She's young, and his bringing her here
is a serious...

57
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,291
Mightn't he do something to her?

58
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,814
Just leave that to us.
We'll know how to handle him.

59
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,130
But I want you to know
he's a dangerous man.

60
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,609
I honestly don't think
he'd stop at anything.

61
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,136
I don't think he'd hesitate to kill Corinne
if it would save him.

62
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,256
Could he cover up by marrying her?

63
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,969
He has a wife and three children
in England.

64
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,496
They usually do, though not always
in England. What does he look like?

65
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,299
He has dark hair
and thick, bushy eyebrows.

66
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,739
He talks in a loud, blustery manner.
He gives the impression of being violent.

67
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,415
He was wearing a light gray suit and
a gray hat when I saw him this morning.

68
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,853
What does he do?

69
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,419
I haven't the faintest idea.

70
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,855
- What time's he comin' to see you?
- After 8:00.

71
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,613
All right, Miss Wonderly.
We'll have a man there.

72
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,776
I'll look after it myself.

73
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,449
Thank you.

74
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,815
Oh, yes.

75
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,053
Will that be enough?

76
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,852
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

77
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,173
It'll help some if you meet Thursby
in the lobby.

78
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,053
You don't have to look for me.
I'll see you all right.

79
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,209
Thank you.

80
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,296
- Thank you so much.
- Good-bye.

81
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,059
They're right enough.

82
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,251
They have brothers in her bag.

83
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,050
- What do you think of her?
- She's sweet.

84
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,933
Maybe you saw her first, Sam,
but I spoke first.

85
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,453
You've got brains.

86
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,173
Yes, you have.

87
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,489
Hello.

88
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,733
Yeah. Speaking.

89
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,293
Miles Archer dead?

90
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,609
Where?

91
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,892
Bush and Stockton?

92
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,770
Yeah.

93
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,528
In 15 minutes.

94
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,689
Thanks.

95
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,049
Hello, Effie?

96
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,689
It's me.

97
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,933
Now, listen, precious.

98
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,573
Miles has been shot.

99
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,539
Yeah, dead.

100
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,658
Now, don't get excited.

101
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,370
Yeah.

102
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,898
You'll have to break the news to Iva.
I'd fry first.

103
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,452
And keep her away from me.

104
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,493
That's a good girl.

105
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,738
Now, get right over there.

106
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,413
You're an angel.

107
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,209
Good-bye.

108
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,811
- What do you want here?
- I'm Sam Spade. Tom Polhaus phoned.

109
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,494
I didn't know you at first.
They're back there.

110
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,330
Hello, Sam. I figured you'd want to see it
before we took him away.

111
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,853
Thanks, Tom. What happened?

112
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,170
Got him right through the pump with this.

113
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,454
It's a Webley.

114
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,373
English, ain't it?

115
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,536
A Webley-Forsby.45 automatic, 8-shot.
They don't make 'em anymore.

116
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,770
- How many gone out of it?
- Just one.

117
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,652
Let's see. Shot up here, huh?

118
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,890
Standing like you,
with his back to the fence.

119
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,936
The man who shot him stood here.

120
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,419
Went backwards down the hill, takin'
the fence with him, got caught on the rock.

121
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,331
That's it. The blast burnt his coat.

122
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,331
- Who found him?
- Man on the beat.

123
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,495
- Anybody hear the shot?
- Somebody must've. We just got here.

124
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,054
You want to look at him
before we take him away?

125
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,096
No, you've seen everything I could.

126
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,330
His gun was still on his hip.
Hadn't been fired.

127
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,773
His overcoat was buttoned.

128
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,535
I found a $100 bill in his vest pocket
and about $30 in his pants.

129
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,292
Was he workin', Sam?

130
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,335
Well?

131
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,054
- He was tailing a guy named Thursby.
- What for?

132
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,816
What for?

133
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,017
We wanted to find out where he lived.
Don't crowd me, Tom.

134
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,054
I'm goin' on down to break the news
to Miles' wife.

135
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,734
It's tough, him gettin' it like that, ain't it?

136
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,939
Miles had his faults like any of us,
but he must've had some good points, too.

137
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,175
I guess so.

138
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,498
Miss Wonderly, please.

139
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,692
Checked out? What time?

140
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,098
Any forwarding address?

141
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,815
Thanks.

142
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,815
Hello, Tom. Hello, Lieutenant. Come in.

143
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,095
Sit down.

144
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,375
Sit down.

145
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,095
Drink?

146
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,534
You break the news to Miles' wife, Sam?

147
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,094
How'd she take it?

148
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,410
- I don't know anything about women.
- Since when?

149
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,933
What kind of gun do you carry?

150
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,488
None. I don't like 'em.
There are some at the office.

151
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,810
You don't have one here?
You sure about that?

152
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,893
Look around. Turn the dump upside down.
I won't squawk if you got a search warrant.

153
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,254
We don't want to make...

154
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,729
Why are you suckin' around here?
Tell me or get out!

155
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,971
You can't treat us like that. It ain't right.
We got our work to do.

156
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,539
Why were you tailin' Thursby?

157
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,770
I wasn't. Miles was
'cause we had a client...

158
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,579
- Who's the client?
- Sorry, I can't tell you that.

159
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,975
Be reasonable, Sam.
Give us a break, will you?

160
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,211
How can we turn up anything
if you don't tell us what you got?

161
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,088
Tom says you were in too much of a hurry
to stop and look at your dead partner.

162
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,455
You didn't go to Archer's house
to tell his wife.

163
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,089
We called your office and the girl there
said you told her to do it.

164
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,058
I'll give you 10 minutes to get to a phone
and talk to her.

165
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,574
I'll give you 10 minutes
to get to Thursby's joint.

166
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,776
You could do it easily in that time.

167
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,452
What's your boyfriend gettin' at?

168
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,373
Just this: Thursby was shot down
in front of his hotel...

169
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,530
...half an hour after you left Bush Street.

170
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,894
Keep your paws off me.

171
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,538
What time did you get home?

172
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,293
A few minutes ago.
I was walkin' and thinkin' things over.

173
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,098
We know. We tried to call you.

174
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,613
- Where'd you walk?
- Bush Street.

175
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,055
- Did you see anybody...
- No. No witnesses.

176
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,571
Well, I know where I stand now.

177
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,895
Sorry I got up on my hind legs, but
you tryin' to rope me made me nervous.

178
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,858
Miles gettin' killed upset me,
then you birds crackin' foxy.

179
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,249
It's all right now that I know
what it's all about.

180
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,489
Forget it, Sam.

181
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,899
- Thursby die?
- Yep.

182
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,413
How'd I kill him? I forget.

183
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,891
He was shot in the back four times
with a.44 or.45 from across the street.

184
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,137
Nobody saw it, but that's how it figures.

185
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,132
- Hotel people know anything?
- Just that he lived there a week.

186
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,619
- Alone?
- Yeah, alone.

187
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,056
Did you find out who he was?
What his game was? Well, did you?

188
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,213
- We thought you could tell us that.
- I've never seen Thursby, dead or alive.

189
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,568
You know me, Spade.

190
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,539
If you did it, or if you didn't, you'll get
a square deal and most of the breaks.

191
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,737
Don't know if I'd blame you,
a man that killed your partner...

192
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,254
...but that won't stop me from nailin' you.

193
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,295
Fair enough.

194
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,497
But I'd feel better about it
if you'd have a drink with me.

195
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,699
Success to crime!

196
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,893
She's in there.

197
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,255
- I told you to keep her away from me.
- Yes, but you didn't tell me how.

198
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,929
Don't be cranky with me.
I've had her all night.

199
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,931
Sorry, angel. I didn't mean...

200
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,815
Hello, Iva.

201
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,249
Sam!

202
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,295
Darling.

203
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,651
Effie take care of everything?

204
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,969
I think so.

205
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,656
Sam, did you kill him?

206
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,175
Who put that bright idea in your head?

207
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,052
Well, I thought you said
if it wasn't for Miles, you'd...

208
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,818
Be kind to me, Sam.

209
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,619
"You killed my husband, Sam.
Be kind to me!"

210
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,933
Don't, Iva, don't.

211
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,850
You shouldn't have come here today,
darling. You ought to be home.

212
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,293
You'll come soon?

213
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,893
Soon as I can.

214
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,739
Good-bye, Iva.

215
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,055
Well...

216
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,816
...how did you and the widow make out?

217
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,373
She thinks I shot Miles.

218
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,418
- So you could marry her?
- The cops think I killed Thursby...

219
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,889
...the guy Miles was tailing
for that Wonderly dame.

220
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,379
Who do you think I shot?

221
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,859
Are you going to marry Iva?

222
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,659
Don't be silly.
I wish I'd never laid eyes on her.

223
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,135
Do you suppose she could have killed him?

224
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,658
You're an angel.
A nice, rattlebrained, little angel.

225
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,412
- Oh, am I?
- Thanks, honey.

226
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,373
Suppose I told you that your Iva
hadn't been home long...

227
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,338
...when I arrived to break the news
at 3:00 this morning?

228
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,489
Are you telling me?

229
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,855
She kept me waiting at the door
as she undressed.

230
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,693
Her clothes were on a chair
where she'd dumped them.

231
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,691
Her slip, on top, was still warm.

232
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,214
She'd wrinkled the bed,
but they weren't mashed down.

233
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,053
You're a detective, darling,
but she didn't kill him.

234
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,813
Do the police really think
you shot this what's his name?

235
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,776
Do they?

236
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,179
Look at me, Sam.

237
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,734
You worry me.

238
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,053
You think you know what you're doing,
but you're too slick for your own good.

239
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,572
Someday you're going to find it out.
Spade and Archer.

240
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,538
Yes, Miss Wonderly.

241
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,215
Hello.

242
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,098
Yeah, this is Sam Spade.

243
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,615
Where?

244
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,455
Coronet Apartments, California Avenue,
Apartment 1001.

245
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,449
What's the name?

246
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,893
Miss LeBlanc.

247
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,052
Okay, I'll be right over.

248
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,729
Have Miles' desk moved out of the office...

249
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,210
...and have "Spade and Archer" taken off
the doors and windows, and...

250
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,018
...have "Samuel Spade" put on.

251
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,099
Come in, Mr. Spade.

252
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,735
Everything's upside down.
I haven't finished unpacking. Sit down.

253
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,088
Mr. Spade, I...

254
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,899
...I have a terrible,
terrible confession to make.

255
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,136
That story I told you yesterday...

256
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,093
...was just a story.

257
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,490
Oh, that. Well, we didn't exactly
believe your story, Miss...

258
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,016
What is your name, Wonderly or LeBlanc?

259
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,170
It's O'Shaughnessy. Brigid O'Shaughnessy.

260
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,649
We didn't exactly believe your story.

261
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,253
We believed your $200.

262
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,136
You mean...

263
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,495
You paid us more
than if you'd told the truth...

264
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,696
...and enough more to make it all right.

265
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,738
Tell me, Mr. Spade,
am I to blame for last night?

266
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,131
You warned us that Thursby
was dangerous.

267
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,849
You lied to us about your sister
and all that, but we didn't believe you.

268
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,295
No, I wouldn't say that you were at fault.

269
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,574
Thank you.

270
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,136
Mr. Archer was so alive yesterday...

271
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,495
...so solid and hearty, and...
- Stop it.

272
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,618
He knew what he was doing.
Those are the chances we take.

273
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,689
Was he married?

274
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,455
Yeah, with $10,000 insurance, no children,
and a wife that didn't like him.

275
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,929
- Please don't.
- That's the way it was.

276
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,773
Anyway, there's no time for worrying
about that now.

277
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,932
Out there's a flock of policemen
and assistant DAs...

278
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,739
...running around with their noses
to the ground.

279
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,815
Mr. Spade, do they know about me?

280
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,574
Not yet. I've been stalling 'em
until I could see you.

281
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,854
Do they have to know?

282
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,818
Can't you shield me so I won't have
to answer their questions?

283
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,334
Maybe, but I gotta know
what it's all about.

284
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,619
I can't tell you.

285
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,173
I can't tell you now.

286
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,932
I will later, when I can.

287
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,216
You've got to trust me, Mr. Spade.

288
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,897
I'm so alone and afraid.

289
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,773
I've got nobody to help me
if you won't help me.

290
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,898
Be generous, Mr. Spade.

291
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,131
You're brave. You're strong.

292
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,093
You can spare me some
of that courage and strength, surely.

293
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,455
Help me, Mr. Spade. I need help so badly.

294
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,737
I've no right to ask you, I know I haven't,
but I do ask you.

295
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,775
Help me.

296
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,493
You won't need much of anybody's help.
You're good.

297
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,737
It's chiefly your eyes,
and that throb you got in your voice...

298
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,812
...when you say things like,
"Be generous, Mr. Spade."

299
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,333
I deserve that.

300
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,734
But the lie was in the way I said it,
not at all in what I said.

301
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,380
It's my own fault
if you can't believe me now.

302
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,811
Now, you are dangerous.

303
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,980
I'm afraid I won't be able
to be of much help to you...

304
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,937
...without some idea of what it's about.

305
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,808
For instance, I've gotta have some sort
of a line on your Floyd Thursby.

306
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,499
I met him in the Orient.

307
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,333
We came from Hong Kong last week.
He promised to help me.

308
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,014
He took advantage of my dependence
on him to betray me.

309
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,012
Betray you? How?
Why did you want him shadowed?

310
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,776
To find out how far he'd gone,
whom he'd met, things like that.

311
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,896
- Did he kill Archer?
- Certainly.

312
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,054
He had a Luger in his shoulder holster.
Archer wasn't shot with a Luger.

313
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,412
Mr. Spade, you don't think I had anything
to do with the death of Mr. Archer?

314
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,809
- Did you?
- No.

315
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,129
That's good.

316
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,013
Floyd always carried an extra revolver
in his coat pocket.

317
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,658
Why all the guns?

318
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,219
He lived by them.

319
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,575
The story is that he first came
to the Orient...

320
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,379
...as bodyguard to a gambler
who'd had to leave the States.

321
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,294
The gambler had since disappeared
and Floyd knew about it. I don't know.

322
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,770
I do know he always went heavily armed,
and he never went to sleep...

323
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,897
...without covering the floor around his bed
with newspapers...

324
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,414
...so that nobody could come silently
into his room.

325
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,218
You picked a nice sort of playmate.

326
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,212
Only that sort could have helped me,
if he'd been loyal.

327
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,052
How bad a spot are you actually in?

328
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,129
Bad as could be.

329
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,414
Physical danger?

330
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,936
I'm not heroic. I don't think
there's anything worse than death.

331
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,450
- Then, it's that?
- It's that, as surely as we're sitting here.

332
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,373
Unless you help me.

333
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,775
Who killed Thursby, your enemies or his?

334
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,689
I don't know.

335
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,414
His, I suppose.

336
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,811
I'm afraid... I don't know.

337
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,414
This is hopeless!
I don't know what you want done...

338
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,058
...or if you know what you want.

339
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,175
Will you go to the police?

340
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,854
I just got to stand still,
and they'll be all over me.

341
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,738
I'll tell 'em all I know,
and you must take your chances.

342
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,129
You've been patient with me
and tried to help me.

343
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,051
It's useless and hopeless, I suppose.

344
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,928
I do thank you for what you've done.
I'll have to take my chances.

345
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,218
How much money have you got?

346
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,972
I've got about $500 left.

347
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,288
Give it to me.

348
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,219
- There's only $400 here.
- I had to keep some to live on.

349
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,779
- Can't you get some more?
- No.

350
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,816
You got anything you can raise money on?

351
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,415
- I've got some furs and a little jewelry.
- You'll have to hock 'em.

352
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,415
There you are.

353
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,695
I'll be back soon with the best news I can.

354
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,340
I'll ring four times: Long, short, long, short.

355
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,696
You needn't bother to come to the door.
I'll let myself in.

356
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,739
Anything stirring?

357
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,253
Did you send the flowers?

358
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,616
You're invaluable, darling.
Get my lawyer on the phone, will you?

359
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,015
Hello, Sid?

360
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,136
I think I'm going to have to tell a coroner
to go to blazes, Sid.

361
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,733
Can I hide behind the sanctity
of my client's identity...

362
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,778
...secrets and whatnots all the same,
priest or lawyer?

363
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,259
But Dundy's getting a little rambunctious,
and maybe it is a bit thick this time.

364
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,013
What'll it cost to be on the safe side?

365
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,294
Maybe it's worth it.

366
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,608
Okay, go ahead.

367
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,015
Gardenia.

368
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,852
Quick, darling, in with him!

369
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,572
Will you come in, Mr. Cairo?

370
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,097
Will you sit down, Mr. Cairo?

371
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,608
Thank you, sir.

372
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,968
Now, what can I do for you, Mr. Cairo?

373
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,973
May a stranger offer condolences
for your partner's unfortunate death?

374
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,575
Thanks.

375
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,571
Is there, as the newspapers imply...

376
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,494
...a certain relationship between
that unfortunate happening and...

377
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,774
...the death a little later
of the man Thursby?

378
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,537
I beg your pardon. No.

379
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,494
More than idle curiosity prompted
my question.

380
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,449
See, Mr. Spade, I'm trying to recover...

381
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,973
...an ornament that, shall we say,
has been mislaid.

382
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,290
I thought and hoped you could assist me.

383
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,257
The ornament is a statuette...

384
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,812
...a black figure of a bird.

385
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,017
I am prepared to pay, on behalf of...

386
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,854
...the figure's rightful owner,
the sum of $5,000 for its recovery.

387
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,851
I am prepared to promise that,
what is the phrase...

388
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,378
..."No questions will be asked."

389
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,371
$5,000 is a lot of money.

390
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,329
Yes, Effie?

391
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,576
No, that'll be all. Just be sure
to lock the door on your way out.

392
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,775
Good night.

393
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,895
$5,000 is...

394
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,131
You will clasp your hands together
at the back of your neck.

395
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,054
I intend to search your offices, Mr. Spade.

396
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,575
I warn you, if you attempt to prevent me,
I shall certainly shoot you.

397
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,699
Go ahead and search.

398
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,340
Please come to the center of the room.

399
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,135
I have to make certain
that you are not armed.

400
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,218
Look what you did to my shirt!

401
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,369
Sorry.

402
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,532
But imagine my embarrassment
at discovering that $5,000 offer...

403
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,848
...was just hooey.

404
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,010
Mr. Spade, my offer is genuine.

405
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,457
I am prepared to pay $5,000
for the figure's return.

406
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,293
- You have it?
- No.

407
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,694
If it isn't here...

408
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,692
...why did you risk serious injury
to prevent my searching?

409
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,738
Why should I sit here
and let people come in and stick me up?

410
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,937
Certainly it is only natural
that I try to save the owner...

411
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,056
...such a considerable expense if possible.

412
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,209
Who is he?

413
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,770
Mr. Spade, you'll forgive
my not answering that question.

414
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,330
I think we'd be better off all around
if we'd put our cards on the table.

415
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,650
No, I do not think it would be better.

416
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,697
You see, if you know more than I do,
then I shall profit by your knowledge.

417
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,534
So will you, to the extent of $5,000.

418
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,055
There's nothing like $5,000 here.

419
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,734
You want some assurance of my sincerity?

420
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,136
- A retainer? Would that do?
- It might.

421
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,131
You will take, say, $100?

422
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,331
No. I will take, say, $200.

423
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,490
Your first guess was that I had the bird.
There's nothing to that.

424
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,933
What's your second guess?

425
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,933
That you know where it is, or at least
you know it is where you can get it.

426
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,454
You're not hiring me to do murders
or burglaries...

427
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,691
...but simply to get it back if possible,
in an honest, lawful way?

428
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,213
If possible. But...

429
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,856
...in any case, with discretion.

430
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,535
When you wish to contact me, sir,
I'm staying at the Hotel Belvedere...

431
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,531
...Room 635.

432
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,732
I sincerely expect
the greatest mutual benefit...

433
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,215
...from our association, Mr. Spade.

434
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,778
May I please have my gun now?

435
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,090
Oh, sure. I'd forgotten all about it.

436
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,297
You will please clasp your hands together
at the back of your neck.

437
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,416
I intend to search your offices.

438
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,859
Well, I'll be...

439
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,169
Why, sure.

440
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,058
Go ahead. I won't stop you.

441
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,459
- Turn right and go up the hill, driver.
- Okay.

442
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,295
Mr. Spade!

443
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,658
Do you bring me any news?

444
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,732
Did you manage it so the police
won't have to know about me?

445
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,458
They won't for a while, anyway.

446
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,053
You are wonderful!

447
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,213
You won't get into trouble?

448
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,689
I don't mind a reasonable amount
of trouble.

449
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,454
Do sit down.

450
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,095
You aren't exactly the sort of a person
you pretend to be, are you?

451
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,738
Why, I'm not sure I know exactly
what you mean.

452
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,409
The schoolgirl manner. You know,
blushing, stammering and all that.

453
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,408
I haven't lived a good life. I've been bad.

454
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,573
Worse than you could know.

455
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,050
Good, because if you actually were
as innocent as you pretend to be...

456
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,539
...we'd never get anywhere.

457
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,894
I won't be innocent.

458
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,935
Good.

459
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,690
By the way, I saw Joel Cairo tonight.

460
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,375
Do you know him?

461
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,654
Only slightly.

462
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,731
You're good. You're very good.

463
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,693
- What did he say?
- About what?

464
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,418
- About me.
- Nothing.

465
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,699
- What did you talk about then?
- He offered me $5,000 for the black bird.

466
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,258
You won't go around straightening things
and poking the fire again, will you?

467
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,495
No, I'm not.

468
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,332
- What did you say?
- I said $5,000 was a lot of money.

469
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,655
It is.

470
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,935
It's more than I can ever offer you
if I have to bid for your loyalty.

471
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,737
That's good coming from you.

472
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,889
What have you ever given me
besides money?

473
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,938
Have you ever given me
any of your confidence, any truth?

474
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,375
Haven't you tried to buy my loyalty
with only money?

475
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,655
What else is there I can buy you with?

476
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,816
I don't care what your secrets are.

477
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,170
But I can't go ahead without
more confidence in you than I've got now.

478
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,013
You have to convince me
you aren't just fiddling around...

479
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,330
...hoping it'll all come out right in the end.

480
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,489
Trust me a little longer?

481
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,855
How much is a little?
What are you waiting for?

482
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,532
I've got to talk to Joel Cairo.

483
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,817
You can see him tonight.
He's at the theater. It'll be out soon.

484
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,778
- I'll leave a message at his hotel.
- But he can't come here.

485
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,851
I'm afraid to let him know where I am.

486
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,168
My place, then.

487
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,215
Hello?

488
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,849
I want to leave a message for Joel Cairo.

489
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,655
I never would've placed myself
in this position...

490
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,537
...if I didn't trust you completely.

491
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,655
That again?

492
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,697
You know that's true, though.

493
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,855
You don't have to trust me as long
as you can persuade me to trust you.

494
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,051
But don't worry about that now.

495
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,978
He'll be along any minute.

496
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,970
You get your business with Cairo over with
then we'll see how we stand.

497
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,891
You'll let me go about it with him...

498
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,049
...in my own way?

499
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,175
Sure.

500
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,572
You are a godsend.

501
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,012
Now, don't overdo it.

502
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,575
Mr. Spade! There is a boy outside.
He seems to be watching the house.

503
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,888
I know. I spotted him.

504
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,891
What? What's that? What boy?

505
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,414
A kid. He's been trailing me all evening.

506
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,458
- Did he follow you to my apartment?
- I shook him before that.

507
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,212
Come in, Mr. Cairo.

508
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,739
- I'm delighted to see you again, madam.
- I was sure you would be, Joel.

509
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,618
Mr. Spade told me about your offer
for the falcon.

510
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,850
- When will the money be ready?
- It is ready.

511
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,134
- In cash?
- Yes.

512
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,053
You're ready to pay $5,000
if we turn over the falcon to you?

513
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,893
Excuse me, please.
I must have expressed myself badly.

514
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,448
I did not mean that I have the money
in my pocket...

515
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,418
...but I am ready to get it for you
on a few minutes' notice...

516
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,172
...anytime during banking hours.

517
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,774
That's probably true.
He only had a couple hundred...

518
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,294
...when I searched him this afternoon
at my office.

519
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,896
I shall be able to have the money for you
at, say, 10:30 in the morning.

520
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,811
But I haven't got the falcon.

521
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,219
I'll have it in another week
at the most, though.

522
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,619
Then, where is it?

523
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,174
Where Floyd hid it.

524
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,215
Floyd?

525
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,012
You know where he hid it?
Then why do we have to wait a week?

526
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,533
Perhaps not a whole week.

527
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,454
And why, if I may ask another question,
are you willing to sell it to me?

528
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,898
Because I'm afraid.

529
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,815
After Floyd, I'm afraid to touch it
except to turn it over to somebody else.

530
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,856
What exactly did happen to Floyd?

531
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,529
The fat man.

532
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,449
The fat man? Is he here?

533
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,612
I don't know. I suppose so.

534
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,373
What difference does it make?

535
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,530
It might make a world of difference.

536
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,695
Or you or me.

537
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,738
Precisely. But, shall we add,
more certainly...

538
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,214
...the boy outside?

539
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,576
Yes. But you might be able
to get around him, Joel...

540
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,491
...as you did the one in Istanbul.

541
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,172
What was his name?

542
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,060
You mean the one you couldn't get
to come to...

543
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,218
This is the second time
that you have laid hands on me!

544
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,054
When you're slapped
you'll take it and like it.

545
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,648
Who's that?

546
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,458
I don't know. Keep quiet.

547
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,255
Hello.

548
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,534
You guys pick swell hours
to do your visiting in.

549
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,770
- What now?
- We want to talk to you.

550
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,613
- Go ahead and talk.
- Do we have to do it out in the hall?

551
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,373
- You can't come in.
- Come off it now, Sam.

552
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,050
You aren't tryin' to strongarm me, are you?

553
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,539
Why don't you be reasonable?

554
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,611
It would pay you to play along with us.

555
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,737
You got away with this and that,
but you can't keep it up forever.

556
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,573
- Stop me when you can.
- That's what I intend to do.

557
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,015
There's talk about you and Archer's wife.

558
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,136
- Is there anything to it?
- Not a thing.

559
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,973
She tried to get a divorce from him
to put in with you...

560
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,654
...but he wouldn't give it to her.
Anything to that?

561
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,617
Talk is that's why he was put on the spot.

562
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,338
Don't be a hog, Dundy.

563
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,888
Your idea I killed Thursby
because he killed Miles...

564
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,369
...falls to pieces if I'm blamed
for killing Miles.

565
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,416
You haven't heard me say
you killed anybody.

566
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,774
You keep bringing that up.

567
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,420
Haven't you anything better to do
than to pop in here...

568
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,775
...early every morning asking
fool questions?

569
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,613
- And gettin' a lot of lyin' answers.
- Take it easy.

570
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,449
If you say there's nothin' between you
and Archer's wife, you're a liar.

571
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,816
Is that the hot tip that brought you up here
at this ungodly hour?

572
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,174
That's one of 'em.

573
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,613
And the other?

574
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,215
Let us in!

575
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,898
All right, Spade, we'll go.

576
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,254
Maybe you're right in buckin' us.
Think it over.

577
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,975
Help!

578
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,769
- I guess we're goin' in.
- I guess you are.

579
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,013
What's goin' on in here?

580
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,489
Look, Officer! Look what she did!

581
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,131
- Did you do that?
- I had to.

582
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,176
I was alone with him.
He tried to attack me.

583
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,057
I had to keep him off. I couldn't shoot him!

584
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,018
You dirty, filthy liar! It isn't true!

585
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,013
I came up here in good faith,
then both of them attacked me.

586
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,456
Then when he went out to talk to you
he left her here with a pistol.

587
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,815
She said as soon as you leave
they'll kill me...

588
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,097
...so I called for help. I didn't want you
to leave me to be murdered.

589
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,250
And then she struck me with the pistol!

590
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,570
Why don't you make him tell the truth?

591
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,529
Wait a minute!

592
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,973
That's no way to act!

593
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,574
I don't guess we'll be wrong
runnin' the lot of 'em in.

594
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,094
Don't be in a hurry.
Everything can be explained.

595
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,090
I'll bet.

596
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,093
Miss O'Shaughnessy, Lieutenant Dundy
and Detective Sergeant Polhaus.

597
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,775
Miss O'Shaughnessy is an operative
in my employ since yesterday.

598
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,929
That's a lie, too!

599
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,578
That is Mr. Joel Cairo.

600
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,694
Cairo was an acquaintance of Thursby's.
He came to my office late this afternoon...

601
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,614
...and hired me to find something Thursby
had on him when he was bumped off.

602
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,851
It looked funny to me the way he put it,
so I wouldn't touch it.

603
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,852
Then he pulled a gun on me.
That's neither here nor there...

604
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,977
...unless we start preferring charges
against each other.

605
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,370
Miss O'Shaughnessy and I discussed
the matter and decided to find out...

606
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,532
...exactly how much he knew
about Miles' and Thursby's killings...

607
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,258
...so we asked him to come here.

608
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,650
Now, maybe we did put the questions
to him a little roughly...

609
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,817
You know how that is, Lieutenant?

610
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,619
But we didn't hurt him enough
to make him cry for help.

611
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,578
- What have you got to say to that?
- I don't know what to say.

612
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,979
Try tellin' the facts.

613
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,937
- What? Facts?
- Quit stallin'.

614
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,899
Just swear out a complaint they took
a poke at you and I'll throw 'em in the can.

615
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,971
Go ahead, Cairo. Tell him you'll do it.

616
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,735
Then we'll swear out a complaint
against you and he'll have the lot of us.

617
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,219
Get your hats.

618
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,418
Well, boys and girls, we put it over nicely!

619
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,848
Go on, get your hats!

620
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,658
Don't you know when you're bein' kidded?

621
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,970
No, but that can wait till we get
to the Hall.

622
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,415
Wake up, Dundy, you're being kidded!

623
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,054
When I heard the buzzer, I said:

624
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,291
"There's the police again.
They're getting to be a nuisance!

625
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,733
"When you hear them, scream.

626
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,573
"Then we'll see how far we can string 'em
till they tumble."

627
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,979
Stop it, Sam!

628
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,376
How'd that cut on his head get there?

629
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,372
- Ask him. Maybe he cut himself shaving.
- The cut? No.

630
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,612
When we pretended to be struggling
for the gun, I fell over the carpet. I fell.

631
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,809
Horse feathers!

632
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,051
- Take him along, anyway, for packin' a gun.
- Don't be a sap.

633
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,092
That gun was a plant, it's one of mine.

634
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,058
Too bad it's only a.25,
or you could prove it was the gun...

635
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,495
...that Miles and Thursby were shot with.

636
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,536
- No, Sam! No!
- Then get him out of here!

637
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:21,408
- Get their names and addresses.
- My name is Joel Cairo, Hotel Belvedere.

638
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,092
Miss O'Shaughnessy's address is my office.

639
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,977
- Where do you live?
- Get him out!

640
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,574
Take it easy!
Is that all you want, Lieutenant?

641
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,059
I think I'll be going now.

642
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,459
What's the hurry, Cairo?

643
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,293
There is no hurry.
It's getting quite late, and...

644
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,658
Tell him to leave the gun.

645
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,700
I hope you know what you're doin', Sam.

646
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,054
You're absolutely the wildest,
most unpredictable person I ever knew.

647
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,455
Do you always carry on so highhanded?

648
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,575
Well, you've had your talk with Cairo.

649
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,612
Now you can talk to me.

650
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,819
Yes, of course.

651
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,248
I'm listening.

652
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,099
I'm still listening.

653
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,332
- Look at the time! I must be going.
- No. Not till you've told me all about it.

654
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,979
Am I a prisoner?

655
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,849
Maybe the boy outside
hasn't gone home yet.

656
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,331
Do you suppose he's still there?

657
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,375
Likely.

658
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,093
You can start now.

659
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,929
You are the most insistent person.

660
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,451
And wild and unpredictable, huh?

661
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,935
Say, what's this bird, this falcon,
that everybody's all steamed up about?

662
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,409
Supposing I wouldn't tell you anything
about it?

663
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,492
Would you do something
wild and unpredictable?

664
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,009
I might.

665
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,774
It's a black figure, as you know,
smooth and shiny...

666
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,499
...of a bird, a hawk or falcon,
about that high.

667
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,769
Here.

668
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,570
- What makes it so important?
- I don't know. They wouldn't tell me.

669
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,414
They offered me L500 if I'd help get it away
from the man who had it.

670
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,979
That was in Istanbul?

671
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,215
Marmara.

672
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,215
Go ahead.

673
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,614
But that's all.

674
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,332
They promised me L500
if I'd help them, and I did.

675
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,978
Then we found out that Joel Cairo intended
to desert us...

676
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,052
...taking the falcon with him
and leaving Floyd and me nothing...

677
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,131
...so we did exactly that to him.

678
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,770
But, I wasn't any better off than before.

679
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,135
Floyd had no intention
of keeping his promise...

680
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,212
...about sharing equally.
I'd learned that when we got here.

681
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,938
What's the bird made of?

682
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,615
Porcelain or black stone. I don't know.
I only saw it once for a few minutes.

683
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,294
Floyd showed it to me
when we first got hold of it.

684
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,813
You are a liar!

685
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,935
I am.

686
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,458
I've always been a liar.

687
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,290
Don't brag about it.

688
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,215
Was there any truth at all in that yarn?

689
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,609
Some.

690
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,688
Not very much.

691
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,056
Well, we got all night.

692
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,012
Coffee'll be ready soon.
We'll have a cup and try again.

693
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,858
I'm so tired...

694
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,820
...so tired of lying and making up lies.

695
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,180
Not knowing what is a lie
and what's the truth.

696
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,210
I want to talk to Mr. Cairo. Joel Cairo.

697
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,129
Thanks.

698
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,535
Where is he?

699
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,690
What?

700
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,008
Where is he?

701
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,016
Who?

702
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,209
Cairo.

703
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,450
What do you think you're doin', kiddin' me?

704
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,132
I'll tell you when I am.

705
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,853
New York, aren't you?

706
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,169
Shove off.

707
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,655
You'll have to talk to me
before you're through.

708
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,891
Some of you will,
and you can tell the fat man I said so.

709
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,893
Keep askin' for it
and you're gonna get it, plenty.

710
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,498
I told you to shove off.

711
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,929
Shove off!

712
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,416
People lose teeth talkin' like that.

713
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,014
If you want to hang around,
you'll be polite.

714
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,415
Luke.

715
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,897
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Luke.

716
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,335
Say, that was too bad about Miles.

717
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,218
Yeah. It was a tough break.

718
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,131
I want to show you somethin'.

719
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,620
Why do you let these cheap gunmen
hang around the lobby...

720
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,294
...with their heaters bulging
in their clothes?

721
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,498
What do you want here?

722
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,897
If you don't want anything, beat it...

723
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,538
...and don't come back!

724
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,498
I won't forget you guys.

725
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,858
- What is it?
- I don't know. I just spotted him.

726
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,852
- Say, what about Miles?
- I'll see you, Luke.

727
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,093
- 603.
- Yes, sir.

728
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,449
Good morning.

729
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,815
Good morning.

730
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,458
Let's go where we can talk.

731
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,249
Our private conversations have not been
such that I'm anxious to continue them.

732
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,695
Forgive my speaking so bluntly
but it is the truth.

733
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,011
Last night? What could I do?
I had to. I don't know where the bird is.

734
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,251
Neither do you. She does.
How'll we get it if I don't play along?

735
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,900
You always have a very smooth
explanation ready, huh?

736
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,857
Should I learn to stutter?

737
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,454
Did Dundy take you to the station?
For how long?

738
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,178
Till a little while ago.

739
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,491
- What'd they shake out of you?
- Shake out? Not one thing.

740
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,492
I adhered to the course you indicated
earlier in your room...

741
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,856
...but I wish you would have invented
a more reasonable story.

742
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,090
I felt distinctly like an idiot repeating it.

743
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,296
Don't worry about the story's goofiness.

744
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,940
A sensible one would have had us all
in the cooler.

745
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,454
- You sure you didn't tell 'em anything?
- I did not.

746
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,215
You'll want sleep, if you've been
standing up under a police grilling all night.

747
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,415
I'll see you later.

748
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,376
No, not yet.

749
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,459
Yes, I'll have him call you
the minute he comes in.

750
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,974
That's the third time she's called
this morning.

751
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,459
Miss O'Shaughnessy's in there.

752
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,336
Anything else?

753
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,935
The DA's office called.
Bryan would like to see you.

754
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,738
And a Mr. Gutman called.

755
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,095
I said you weren't in.
He said, "Please tell him...

756
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:49,332
"...the young man gave me his message,
and that I phoned, and will phone again."

757
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,175
Gutman, huh?

758
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,739
Thanks, darling.

759
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,889
Darling! Somebody's been
in my apartment!

760
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,814
It's all upside down!
I changed as fast as I could and came over.

761
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,578
Did that boy follow you?

762
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,335
No, angel. I shook him off
long before I ever went to your place.

763
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,412
It might have been Cairo.
He wasn't at the hotel last night.

764
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,572
He told me he'd been standing up
under a police grilling. I wonder.

765
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,457
- You saw Joel this morning?
- Yeah.

766
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,450
Why?

767
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,895
Because, true love,
I need to keep in touch...

768
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:23,258
...with all the loose ends of this dizzy affair
if I'm ever to make heads or tails of it.

769
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,456
Now, we've got to find a new home
for you.

770
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,337
I won't go back there!

771
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,976
I got an idea. Wait a minute.

772
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,617
What's your woman's intuition say
about her?

773
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,772
She's all right. Maybe it's her own fault
for the trouble...

774
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,373
...but she's all right.

775
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,290
That's what I mean.

776
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,416
Are you strong enough to put her up
for a bit?

777
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,138
- You mean at home?
- Yeah.

778
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,899
- Is she in any danger, Sam?
- I think she is.

779
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,450
Gee, that'd scare Mom
into a green hemorrhage.

780
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,816
I'll say she's a surprise witness
you're keeping undercover.

781
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,174
You're a darling.

782
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,169
Brigid.

783
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,931
Effie has offered to put you up.

784
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,169
That's very kind.

785
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,091
Start now. Go out the back entrance.

786
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,330
There's usually a cab parked
by the alleyway.

787
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,809
Ride partway with her.
Be sure you're not followed.

788
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,175
You better change cabs a few times
to be safe.

789
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,090
I'll call Mom.

790
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,774
There's time enough for that
when you get back.

791
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,493
I'll call you later.

792
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,455
Hello.

793
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,259
This is Samuel Spade.

794
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:41,213
Say, my secretary tells me
Mr. Bryan wants to see me.

795
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,259
Yeah. Ask him what time's
most convenient for him.

796
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,850
Spade. S-p-a-d-e.

797
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,094
Hello, honey.

798
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,176
Yeah.

799
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,536
2:30. All right. Thanks.

800
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,449
Sam, forgive me. Please forgive me.

801
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,290
I sent those policemen to your place.

802
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,417
I was mad, crazy with jealousy.
I phoned that if they went there...

803
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,491
...they'd learn something
about Miles' murder.

804
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,731
- What made you think of that?
- I was mad, Sam. I wanted to hurt you.

805
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,334
- Did you tell 'em who you were?
- No. Sam, dearest, l...

806
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,455
Where'd you phone from?

807
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,212
The drugstore across from your place.

808
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,734
Better hurry home and think
what to tell the police.

809
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,855
You'll hear from them.

810
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:17,975
By the way...

811
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,734
...where were you the night Miles
was murdered?

812
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,135
Home.

813
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,975
- I was.
- No!

814
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,819
But if that's your story,
it's all right with me.

815
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,099
Now, you run along.

816
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,450
Hello.

817
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,973
Yeah, this is Spade.

818
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:45,093
Yes, Mr. Gutman, I got it.
I've been waitin' to hear from you.

819
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,411
Well, now? The sooner, the better.
Say 15 minutes. Right.

820
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,849
12C.

821
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,691
12C to your left, sir.

822
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,449
Mr. Spade!

823
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,218
How do you do, Mr. Gutman?

824
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,015
You begin well, sir.

825
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,091
I distrust a man who says "when."

826
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,530
He's got to be careful
not to drink too much...

827
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,815
...because he's not to be trusted
when he does.

828
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,015
Well, sir...

829
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,333
...here's to plain speaking
and clear understanding.

830
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,979
You're a close-mouthed man?

831
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,254
No, I like to talk.

832
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,093
Better and better.
I distrust a close-mouthed man.

833
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:01,250
He generally picks the wrong time to talk
and says the wrong things.

834
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:05,299
Talking's something you can't do
judiciously unless you keep in practice.

835
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,976
Now, sir. We'll talk, if you like.

836
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:13,179
I'll tell you right out. I'm a man who likes
talking to a man who likes to talk.

837
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,136
Swell!

838
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,376
Will we talk about the black bird?

839
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,773
You're the man for me, sir.

840
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:21,374
No beating about the bush.
Right to the point.

841
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,610
Let's talk about the black bird,
by all means.

842
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,179
First, answer me a question.

843
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,058
Are you here
as Miss O'Shaughnessy's representative?

844
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,615
There's nothing certain either way.
It depends.

845
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,894
It depends on?

846
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,611
Maybe it depends on Joel Cairo.

847
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,690
Maybe.

848
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,772
The question is which do you represent?
It'll be one or the other.

849
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,293
I didn't say so.

850
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,171
- Who else is it?
- There's me.

851
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,572
That's wonderful, sir, wonderful.

852
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,970
I do like a man who tells you right out
he's lookin' out for himself.

853
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,254
Don't we all?

854
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,775
I don't trust a man who says he's not.

855
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,290
Now, let's talk about the black bird.

856
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,330
Let's.

857
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,055
Mr. Spade, have you any conception...

858
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:05,253
...of how much money can be got
for that black bird?

859
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,290
No.

860
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,619
Well, sir, if I told you,
if I told you half, you'd call me a liar.

861
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,412
No, not even if I thought so.

862
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,651
But you tell me what it is,
and I'll figure out the profit.

863
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,936
You mean, you don't know
what that bird is?

864
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,375
I know what it's supposed to look like...

865
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,372
...and I know the value in human life
you people put on it.

866
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,411
She didn't tell you what it is?

867
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,457
- Cairo didn't either?
- He offered me $10,000 for it.

868
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,734
$10,000!

869
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,290
Dollars, mind you, not even pounds!

870
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,739
Do they know what that bird is?
What is your impression?

871
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:43,096
There's not much to go by.
Cairo didn't say he did or he didn't.

872
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,297
She said she didn't but I took it for granted
she was lying.

873
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,291
Not an injudicious thing to do.

874
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,653
If they don't know, I'm the only one
in the whole wide sweet world who does.

875
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,459
Swell! When you've told me,
that'll make two of us.

876
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:00,692
Mathematically correct, but I don't know
for certain that I'm going to tell you.

877
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,732
Don't be foolish. You know what it is.
I know where it is.

878
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,412
Well, sir, where is it?

879
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:09,734
You see, I must tell you what I know,
but you won't tell me what you know.

880
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,898
It's hardly equitable, sir.

881
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,577
No, no. I don't think we can do business
along those lines.

882
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,730
Well, think again, and think fast!

883
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,368
I told that gunsel of yours
you'd have to talk to me!

884
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,849
You'll talk to me today, or you are through!

885
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,613
Why are you wasting my time?
I can get along without you!

886
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,849
And another thing:

887
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,215
Keep that gunsel out of my way
while you decide.

888
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,052
I'll kill him, if you don't!

889
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,973
Well, sir, I must say you have
a most violent temper.

890
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,374
Think it over. You've got till 5:00.

891
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:40,499
Then you're either in or out, for keeps!

892
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,375
- Who killed Thursby?
- I don't know.

893
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,451
But you could make an excellent guess.

894
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,576
My guess might be excellent or crummy...

895
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,652
...but Mrs. Spade didn't raise children
dippy enough to guess...

896
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,891
...in front of a DA, an assistant DA
and a stenographer.

897
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,618
Why not, if you've nothing to conceal?

898
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,531
Everybody has something to conceal.

899
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,259
I'm a sworn officer of the law
24 hours a day...

900
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,811
...and neither formality nor informality
justifies you withholding...

901
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:30,529
...the evidence of crime from me
except on constitutional grounds.

902
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,656
You and the police have as much
as accused me...

903
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,696
...of being mixed up in the murders.

904
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:37,852
I've had trouble with both of you before,
and as far as I can see...

905
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,738
...my best chance of clearing myself
of the trouble...

906
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,936
...is by bringing in the murderers
all tied up.

907
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,978
The only chance I have of catching them
and bringing them in...

908
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:49,336
...is by staying away from you
because you'd only gum up the works.

909
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,411
You getting this or am I goin' too fast?

910
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,060
- No, sir. I'm getting it all right.
- Good work.

911
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:57,054
If you want to tell the board
I'm obstructing justice...

912
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,370
...and ask them to revoke my license,
hop to it.

913
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,532
You tried it before and it didn't get you
anything but a good laugh.

914
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,338
I don't want any more informal talks.

915
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:07,776
I've nothing to say to you,
and I'm tired of being called things...

916
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,977
...by every crackpot on the city payroll.
If you want to see me...

917
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,416
...pinch me or subpoena me.
I'll come down with my lawyer.

918
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,377
I'll see you at the inquest, maybe!

919
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:21,538
Come on. He wants to see you.

920
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:25,329
I didn't expect you till 5:25.
I hope I haven't kept you waiting.

921
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,815
Keep on ridin' me...

922
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,573
...they're gonna be pickin' iron
out of your liver.

923
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,698
The cheaper the crook,
the gaudier the patter, huh?

924
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,408
Well, let's go.

925
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,259
Come on. This'll put you in solid
with your boss.

926
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,815
Come in, sir. Thank you for coming.
Come in.

927
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,130
You shouldn't let him go around
with these on him.

928
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,176
He might get himself hurt.

929
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,014
Well, what's this?

930
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,615
A crippled newsy took 'em away from him.
I made him give 'em back.

931
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:26,211
By gad, sir, you're a chap worth knowing.
An amazing character. Give me your hat.

932
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,728
Sit down.

933
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,900
- I owe you an apology, sir.
- Never mind that.

934
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,176
Let's talk about the black bird.

935
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,893
All right, sir, let's.

936
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:47,855
Let's.

937
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:52,137
This is going to be the most astounding
thing you've ever heard of.

938
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:55,292
I say this knowing a man
of your caliber and your profession...

939
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,292
...must have known
some astounding things in his time.

940
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,136
What do you know of the Order of
the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem...

941
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,290
...later known as the Knights of Rhodes?

942
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,656
- Crusaders or something, weren't they?
- Very good. Sit down.

943
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,376
In 1539, these crusading Knights...

944
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,611
...persuaded Emperor Charles V
to give them the Island of Malta.

945
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,372
He made but one condition:

946
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,969
That they pay him yearly
the tribute of a falcon...

947
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,620
...in acknowledgement that Malta
was still under Spain.

948
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,213
Do you follow me?

949
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,051
Have you any conception of the extreme...

950
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,370
...the immeasurable wealth
of the Order of that time?

951
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,018
They were pretty well fixed.

952
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,490
"Pretty well" is putting it mildly.
They were rolling in wealth, sir.

953
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:38,970
For years they'd taken from the East
nobody knows what spoils of gems...

954
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,255
...precious metals, silks, ivory, sir.

955
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:44,890
We all know the Holy Wars to them
were largely a matter of loot.

956
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,772
The Knights were profoundly grateful
to the Emperor Charles...

957
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,896
...for his generosity toward them.

958
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,777
They hit upon the thought of sending...

959
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:56,296
...for his first year's tribute,
not an insignificant live bird...

960
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,856
...but a glorious golden falcon...

961
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,937
...crusted from head to foot...

962
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,454
...with the finest jewels in their coffers.

963
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,455
Well, sir...

964
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,656
...what do you think of that?
- I don't know.

965
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,571
These are facts, historical facts...

966
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:13,733
...not schoolbook history, not Mr. Wells'
history, but history, nevertheless.

967
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,454
They sent the foot-high jeweled bird
to Charles in Spain.

968
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,657
They sent it in a galley commanded
by a member of the Order.

969
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,531
It never reached Spain.

970
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,011
A famous admiral of buccaneers...

971
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,809
...took the Knights' galley and the bird.

972
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,019
In 1713 it turned up in Sicily.

973
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,254
In 1840 it appeared in Paris.

974
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,458
It had, by that time,
acquired a coat of black enamel...

975
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:41,453
...so that it looked nothing more
than a fairly interesting black statuette.

976
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:45,255
In that disguise, sir, it was,
as you may say, kicked around Paris...

977
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:48,698
...for over three score years
by private owners too stupid...

978
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,611
...to see what it was under the skin.

979
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,655
Then...

980
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,974
...in 1923 a Greek dealer...

981
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,816
...named Charilaos Konstantinides found it
in an obscure shop.

982
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:03,810
No thickness of enamel could conceal value
from his eyes.

983
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:10,857
- You begin to believe me a little?
- I haven't said I didn't.

984
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:15,292
Well, sir, to hold it safe while pursuing
his researches into its history...

985
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,970
...Charilaos re-enameled the bird.

986
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:21,850
Despite this precaution, however,
I got wind of his find.

987
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,497
If I'd only known a few days sooner.

988
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,059
I was in London when I heard.

989
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,290
I packed a bag,
got on the boat train immediately.

990
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:33,611
On the train I read in the <i>Times</i>,
that Charilaos's establishment...

991
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,055
...had been burglarized and him murdered.

992
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:39,496
Sure enough, on arriving there
I discovered the bird was gone.

993
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,933
That was 17 years ago.

994
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:47,489
Well, sir, it took me 17 years
to locate that bird, but I did.

995
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,528
I wanted it!

996
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,493
I'm a man not easily discouraged
when I want something.

997
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,571
I traced it to the home
of a Russian general...

998
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:58,653
...one Kemidov, in an Istanbul suburb.
He didn't know a thing about it.

999
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,810
It was only a black enameled figure
to him...

1000
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,494
...but his contrariness kept him
from selling it to me...

1001
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,890
...when I made him an offer.
So I sent him some agents to get it.

1002
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,655
Well, sir...

1003
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,015
...they got it and I haven't got it...

1004
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,576
...but I'm going to get it.

1005
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,249
Your glass.

1006
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:20,329
Then, the bird doesn't really belong
to any of you, but to a General Kemidov?

1007
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,856
Well, sir, you might as well say
it belonged to the King of Spain.

1008
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:27,936
I don't see how you can honestly grant
anyone else a clear title to it...

1009
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,056
...except by right of possession.

1010
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:31,848
And now, sir...

1011
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,451
...before we start to talk prices,
how soon can you...

1012
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,969
...or how soon are you willing
to produce the falcon?

1013
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,290
- A couple of days.
- That is satisfactory.

1014
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:45,088
Well, sir, here's to a fair bargain!
Profits large enough for both of us!

1015
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,336
What's your idea of a fair bargain?

1016
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,571
I will give you $25,000 when you deliver
the falcon to me...

1017
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,012
...and another $25,000 later on.

1018
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:56,376
Or I will give you one quarter
of what I realize on the falcon.

1019
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,178
That would amount to a much greater sum.

1020
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,172
- How much greater?
- Who knows? Shall we say $100,000?

1021
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,888
Will you believe me if I name
the probable minimum?

1022
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,095
Why not?

1023
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,728
What would you say
to a quarter of a million?

1024
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,890
Then you think
the dingus is worth a million?

1025
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,732
In your own words, why not?

1026
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:20,014
- That's a lot of dough.
- A lot of dough.

1027
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,132
The minimum? What's the maximum?

1028
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,256
The maximum, I refuse to guess.

1029
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,979
You'd think me crazy.

1030
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,369
I don't know.

1031
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,574
There's no telling how high it could go, sir.

1032
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:36,379
That is the one and only truth about it.

1033
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:53,929
Wilmer!

1034
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,098
Hello, Effie. It's me.

1035
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:22,456
Let me talk to Miss O'Shaughnessy.

1036
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,579
She isn't there?

1037
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:28,978
What? She didn't show up?

1038
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:34,975
You get back to the office and
wait there till I come or you hear from me.

1039
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:37,528
Yeah, let's do something right
for a change.

1040
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,655
It started in the hold aft,
in the rear basement.

1041
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,378
What insurance was she carrying?

1042
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,495
- Anybody burn?
- No.

1043
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,571
Only the harbor watch was aboard.

1044
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,658
- Someone I know came...
- What?

1045
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,776
Someone I know came aboard
this afternoon.

1046
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,976
I haven't seen her since. I'm worried.

1047
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,779
No reason to be, mister.
Everybody got off all right.

1048
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:49,489
I wonder if you saw her.
She's kind of small, about 5-foot...

1049
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:53,892
I couldn't tell you, mister.
But if she came aboard she got off all right.

1050
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:57,257
Only the harbor watch was aboard
when the fire started.

1051
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,769
Now you know as much about it
as I do, precious.

1052
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:04,294
Maybe they went down to the ship.
Maybe they didn't.

1053
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,530
The part about the bird is thrilling.

1054
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,734
Or ridiculous.

1055
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,055
You know...

1056
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,775
Falcon.

1057
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:32,493
Lock that door.

1058
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,415
Is he...

1059
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,572
- Is he...
- Yeah.

1060
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,899
He couldn't have come far
with those holes in him.

1061
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:08,855
Why couldn't he have stayed alive
long enough to tell us something?

1062
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:12,613
Here, here, here, none of that now.
Come on.

1063
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,492
You can't pass out on me now.

1064
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,808
All right, Sam.

1065
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,818
Do you really think...

1066
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:43,018
- We've got it, angel, we've got it.
- You're hurting me.

1067
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:46,259
Answer the phone.

1068
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,215
Hello.

1069
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,415
Yes?

1070
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:52,935
Who?

1071
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,169
Oh, yes.

1072
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,009
Where?

1073
01:05:58,860 --> 01:05:59,975
Yes, yes.

1074
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,577
Hello! Hello! Hello!

1075
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,573
It was Miss O'Shaughnessy!
She wants you! She's in danger!

1076
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,298
- Where is she?
- Burlingame, 26 Ancho.

1077
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:09,699
Her voice, it was awful!

1078
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,738
Something happened
before she could finish. Go help her!

1079
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:16,096
You've got to go to her!
He was helping her and they killed him...

1080
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,579
You've got to go, Sam!

1081
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:19,059
All right, I'll go!

1082
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:21,497
After I've gone, you phone the police.

1083
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,855
Tell 'em how it happened,
but don't say any names!

1084
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,898
I got the call and told you I had to go,
but I didn't say where.

1085
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,540
Forget about this.
Tell 'em how it happened, but without this.

1086
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:32,578
Get that straight.
Everything happened exactly as it did...

1087
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:35,538
...but without the bundle,
and I got the phone call, not you.

1088
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,575
Yes, Sam.

1089
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:37,655
Okay.

1090
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:44,172
Shut this door and lock it
and don't open it till the police come.

1091
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,454
Do you know who he is?

1092
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:48,612
Yeah! Yeah, he's Captain Jacoby,
master of the La Paloma.

1093
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:51,012
You're a good man, sister!

1094
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,016
- May I borrow your pencil?
- Sure.

1095
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,572
- Say, Frank?
- Hello, Mr. Spade.

1096
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,298
- You got plenty of gas?
- Sure thing.

1097
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:43,416
Do you know where Ancho Street
is in Burlingame?

1098
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,819
No, but we'll find her.

1099
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,573
Well, 26 is the number
and the sooner the better.

1100
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,378
Keep your motor running.

1101
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,536
- Bum steer, Mr. Spade?
- Yeah.

1102
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,418
Let's get to a phone booth.

1103
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,056
Hello, Mrs. Perine? Is Effie there?

1104
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,289
Yes, please.

1105
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,975
Hello, precious! What's the good news?

1106
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:44,611
No, no. It was a bum steer.
Are you sure that was her voice?

1107
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:46,379
Well, it was hooey.

1108
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:50,217
Everything go all right?
Nothing said about the bundle, huh?

1109
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,535
That's swell.

1110
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:53,690
Did they take you down to the Hall?

1111
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,009
All right, precious.

1112
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:59,729
You'd better hit the hay and get
a good night's rest. You sound all in.

1113
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:02,539
No. Save it till tomorrow.
I'm going on home.

1114
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:11,092
- Thanks. Good night, Frank.
- Good night, Mr. Spade.

1115
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,848
I've been hiding in a doorway up the street.

1116
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,898
I thought you'd never come.

1117
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:33,131
Can you make it or shall I carry you?

1118
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:36,929
I'll be all right as soon as I can
get some place where I can lie down.

1119
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:50,889
Well, we're all here.

1120
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:53,653
Let's come in and sit down
and be comfortable and talk.

1121
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:54,695
Sure.

1122
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:58,930
- Get away! You're not gonna frisk me.
- Stand still! Shut up!

1123
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:01,488
Take your paws off me
or I'll make you use that gun.

1124
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:04,378
Ask your boss if he wants me shot up
before we talk.

1125
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,059
Never mind, Wilmer.

1126
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:10,414
You certainly are
a most headstrong individual.

1127
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,537
Well, let's be seated.

1128
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:18,696
Are you ready to make the first payment
and take the falcon off my hands?

1129
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:20,691
Well, sir, as to that...

1130
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:23,168
As to that...

1131
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:30,613
$10,000? We were talkin' about
a lot more money than this.

1132
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:33,658
Yes, sir, we were.
But this is genuine coin of the realm.

1133
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:36,015
With a dollar of this
you can buy $10 of talk.

1134
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,375
There are more of us
to be taken care of now.

1135
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,530
That may be, but I've got the falcon!

1136
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:43,088
I shouldn't think it necessary
to remind you...

1137
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:45,978
...that you may have the falcon,
but we certainly have you.

1138
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:49,371
I'm trying not to let that worry me.
We'll get back to the money later on.

1139
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,974
There's something else
to be discussed first.

1140
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:55,778
We've got to have a fall guy.

1141
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:59,375
The police need a victim, somebody
they can pin those three murders on.

1142
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:02,896
Three? There's only two, because
Thursby certainly killed your partner.

1143
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:06,211
Only two then. What's the difference?
We have to give the police...

1144
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,656
Come, Mr. Spade, you can't
expect us to believe at this late date...

1145
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:13,335
...that you're afraid of the police,
or that you're not quite able to handle...

1146
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,853
I'm in this up to my neck.

1147
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:19,138
I've got to find somebody, a victim
when the time comes. If I don't, I'll be it.

1148
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:25,978
Let's give them the gunsel.

1149
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:29,259
He actually did shoot
Thursby and Jacoby, didn't he?

1150
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,979
Anyway, he's made to order for the part.
Look at him!

1151
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,618
Let's give him to them.

1152
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:38,334
By gad, sir, you are a character.
That you are!

1153
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:41,100
There's never any telling
what you'll say or do next...

1154
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:43,091
...but it's bound to be astonishing.

1155
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:45,011
It's our best bet. With him in their hands...

1156
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:48,137
But, my dear man, can't you see
that if I even for a moment...

1157
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,688
...thought of doing such a thing...
That's ridiculous.

1158
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:54,170
I feel towards Wilmer here just exactly
as if he were my own son.

1159
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:55,409
Really, I do.

1160
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,298
But if I even for a moment thought
of doing what you propose...

1161
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,531
...what in the world would keep Wilmer
from telling the police...

1162
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,975
...every last detail about the falcon and all...

1163
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,379
Let him talk his head off.

1164
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:08,133
I'll guarantee you
nobody'll do anything about it.

1165
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:11,453
Well, what do you think of this, Wilmer?
Mighty funny, eh?

1166
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:12,893
Mighty funny.

1167
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:18,815
How do you feel now?
Any better, precious?

1168
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,049
Much better.

1169
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:22,133
But I'm frightened.

1170
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:24,939
Don't be. Nothing very bad's
going to happen here.

1171
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:26,938
Do you want a drink, angel?

1172
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:28,739
Be careful, Sam.

1173
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,610
Well?

1174
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:37,091
If you're really serious, the least we can do
in common politeness is to hear you out.

1175
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:41,651
Now, how would you be able to fix it
so that Wilmer couldn't do us any harm?

1176
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:44,648
I can show Bryan, our DA,
that if he goes around...

1177
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:47,493
...tryin' to collect everybody
he'll have a tangled case...

1178
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:51,129
...but if he sticks to Wilmer here,
he can get a conviction...

1179
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:53,058
...standing on his head.

1180
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:57,732
Get up on your feet.

1181
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:00,539
I've taken all the riding from you
I'm gonna take.

1182
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:02,419
Get up and shoot it out!

1183
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,092
Young Wild West!

1184
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,252
You should tell him shootin' me
before you get the falcon...

1185
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,534
...will be bad for business.

1186
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:11,088
Now, now, Wilmer.
We can't have any of that.

1187
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:13,569
You shouldn't attach such importance
to these things.

1188
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:15,139
Tell him to lay off me then.

1189
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,448
Now, Wilmer...

1190
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:23,091
Your plan is, not at all satisfactory, sir.
Let's not say anything more about it.

1191
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:25,171
All right. I've got another suggestion.

1192
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:28,058
Maybe not as good as the first,
but it's better than nothing.

1193
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:29,129
Want to hear it?

1194
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:30,573
Most assuredly.

1195
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:35,979
Give them Cairo.

1196
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:37,814
Well, by gad, sir...

1197
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:40,414
Suppose we give them
you or Miss O'Shaughnessy?

1198
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,218
You want the falcon. I've got it.

1199
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:45,815
The fall guy's part of the price I'm asking.
As for Miss O'Shaughnessy...

1200
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:49,609
...if you think she can be rigged for the part
I'm willing to discuss it with you.

1201
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:53,329
You seem to forget that you are not
in a position to insist upon anything.

1202
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,569
Now, come, gentlemen.

1203
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:57,174
Let's keep our discussion
on a friendly basis.

1204
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,812
There certainly is something
in what Mr. Cairo said...

1205
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:04,418
If you kill me,
how are you gonna get the bird?

1206
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:08,535
If I know you can't afford to kill me,
how'll you scare me into giving it to you?

1207
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:12,579
Sir, there are other means of persuasion
besides killing and threatening to kill.

1208
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:13,888
Yes, that's...

1209
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:16,295
That's true.

1210
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:21,934
But none of them are any good
unless the threat of death is behind them.

1211
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,214
You see what I mean?

1212
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:27,771
If you start something, I'll make it a matter
of your having to kill me or call it off.

1213
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:33,099
That's an attitude, sir, that calls for
the most delicate judgement on both sides.

1214
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:35,330
Because, as you know,
in the heat of action...

1215
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:38,253
...men are likely to forget where
their best interests lie...

1216
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,535
...and let their emotions carry them away.

1217
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:43,737
And the trick from my angle is
to make my play strong enough...

1218
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:46,618
...to tie you up, not make you mad enough
to bump me off...

1219
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:47,894
...against your better judgement.

1220
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:50,289
By gad, sir, you are a character.

1221
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:58,613
They're selling you out, sonny.

1222
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,529
I hope you're not influenced by the guns...

1223
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:04,339
...these pocket-edition desperadoes
are waving around.

1224
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:07,457
Because I've practiced taking guns away
from these boys before...

1225
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:09,576
...so we'll have no trouble there.

1226
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:11,413
- Wilmer, here...
- All right.

1227
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,455
Wilmer!

1228
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,853
There's our fall guy.

1229
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:48,012
Either say yes right now
or I'll turn the falcon and all of you in.

1230
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:49,328
I don't like that, sir.

1231
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,490
Well, you won't like it. Well?

1232
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:57,613
You can have him.

1233
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:01,859
I won't be able to get the falcon
till daylight, maybe later.

1234
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:04,932
It'd be best for us all
if we didn't leave each other's sight...

1235
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:08,251
...until our business has been transacted.
You have the envelope?

1236
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:10,456
Miss O'Shaughnessy has it. Hang on to it.

1237
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:13,737
We won't lose sight of each other.
The dingus'll be brought to us here.

1238
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:15,378
Excellent, sir, excellent!

1239
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,655
Then in exchange for
the $10,000 and Wilmer...

1240
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,254
...you'll give us the falcon
and an hour or two of grace.

1241
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,615
Now, let's get the details fixed, first.

1242
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:26,852
Why did he shoot Thursby and why, where
and how did he shoot Captain Jacoby?

1243
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:30,774
I've got to know all that happened
so the parts that don't fit are covered up.

1244
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:32,816
I shall be candid with you, sir.

1245
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:35,016
Thursby was Miss O'Shaughnessy's ally.

1246
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,330
We believed that disposing of him
as we did...

1247
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:41,174
...would cause Miss O'Shaughnessy to stop
and think that it would be best...

1248
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:44,411
...to patch up her differences with us
regarding the falcon.

1249
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:47,453
You didn't try to make a deal
before giving him the works?

1250
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,656
We did. Yes, sir. We most certainly did.

1251
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:53,050
I talked to him myself that very night,
but I could do nothing with him.

1252
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:56,018
He was quite determinedly loyal
to Miss O'Shaughnessy.

1253
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:00,371
So Wilmer followed him back to the hotel
and did what he did.

1254
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:02,453
That sounds all right.

1255
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:04,774
Now, Jacoby.

1256
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:09,929
Captain Jacoby's death was entirely
Miss O'Shaughnessy's fault.

1257
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,488
Tell me what happened.

1258
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:14,935
Cairo, as you must have surmised,
contacted me...

1259
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:17,773
...after he left police headquarters
last night or morning.

1260
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:20,693
He recognized the mutual advantage
of pooling forces.

1261
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,250
Mr. Cairo is a man of nice judgement.

1262
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:26,890
The Paloma was his thought.
He read of its arrival in the papers...

1263
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:29,175
...and remembered he had heard
in Hong Kong...

1264
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:32,332
...that Jacoby and Miss O'Shaughnessy
were seen together...

1265
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:37,371
Well, sir, he saw that notice and...

1266
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,894
...putting two and two together
guessed the truth.

1267
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:42,540
She had given the bird to Jacoby
to bring here for her.

1268
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:44,975
And at that juncture you decided
to slip me a Mickey.

1269
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:47,369
There's no place for you in our plan, sir.

1270
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:50,611
So we decided to spare ourselves
any possible embarrassment.

1271
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:54,852
Mr. Cairo and Wilmer and I went
to call on Captain Jacoby.

1272
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,731
We were lucky enough to arrive
while Miss O'Shaughnessy was there.

1273
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:02,130
In many ways, the conference was difficult,
but we finally persuaded...

1274
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:05,178
...Miss O'Shaughnessy to come to terms,
or so we thought.

1275
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:07,569
We then left the boat and set out
for my hotel...

1276
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:10,970
...where I was to pay Miss O'Shaughnessy
and receive the bird.

1277
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,614
Well, sir, we mere men
should have known better.

1278
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:16,134
En route, she, Captain Jacoby
and the falcon...

1279
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:18,575
...slipped completely through our fingers.

1280
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:21,295
It was neatly done, sir. Indeed, it was.

1281
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:24,210
You touched off the boat before you left?

1282
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,653
No, not intentionally.

1283
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:29,335
Though, we, or Wilmer at least,
were responsible for the fire.

1284
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:33,732
While the rest of us were talking
in the cabin, Wilmer went about the boat...

1285
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:36,051
...trying to find the falcon.

1286
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:39,090
No doubt, he was careless with matches.

1287
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,659
And how about the shooting?

1288
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:44,096
We caught up with Miss O'Shaughnessy
and Jacoby at her apartment.

1289
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:48,014
I sent Wilmer downstairs to cover
the fire escape before ringing the bell.

1290
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:51,850
And, sure enough, while she was asking us
who we were through the door...

1291
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:54,500
...and we were telling her,
we heard a window go up.

1292
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:57,492
Wilmer shot Jacoby as he was coming
down the fire escape...

1293
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:01,368
...shot him more than once, but Jacoby
was too tough to fall or drop the falcon.

1294
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:05,135
He climbed down the rest of the way,
knocked Wilmer over, and ran off.

1295
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:10,089
We persuaded, that is the word, sir,
we persuaded Miss O'Shaughnessy...

1296
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:13,092
...to tell us where she told Captain Jacoby
to take the falcon.

1297
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:15,535
We further persuaded her
to phone your office...

1298
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:18,612
...in an attempt to draw you away,
before Jacoby got there...

1299
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,213
...but unfortunately for us...

1300
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,417
...it had taken us too long
to persuade Miss O'Shaughnessy.

1301
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:25,536
You had the falcon
before we could reach you.

1302
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:43,213
Wilmer, I'm sorry to lose you,
but I want you to know...

1303
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:45,894
...I couldn't be fonder of you
if you were my own son.

1304
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:48,892
Well, if you lose a son,
it's possible to get another.

1305
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:51,331
There's only one Maltese Falcon.

1306
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:55,891
When you're young,
you simply don't understand these things.

1307
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:59,088
How about some coffee?

1308
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:00,329
Put the pot on, will you?

1309
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,411
I don't like to leave our guests.

1310
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:03,576
Surely.

1311
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:07,335
Just a moment, my dear. Hadn't you
better leave the envelope in here?

1312
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:12,695
- Sit on it, if you're afraid of losing it.
- You misunderstand me. It's not that.

1313
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:16,090
But business should be transacted
in a businesslike manner.

1314
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:20,698
For instance,
there are only nine bills here now.

1315
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:24,170
There were 10 when I handed them to you,
as you very well know.

1316
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:31,530
Well?

1317
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:33,458
I want to know about this.

1318
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:42,214
You palmed it.

1319
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,455
- I palmed it?
- Yes.

1320
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:45,496
Do you want to say so, or stand for a frisk?

1321
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:48,697
You'll admit it, or I'll search you.
There's no third way.

1322
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:50,373
I believe you would. I really do.

1323
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,371
You're a character,
if you don't mind my saying so.

1324
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:53,688
You palmed it.

1325
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,012
Yes, sir, that I did.

1326
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,930
I must have my little joke now and then.

1327
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,978
I was curious to know what you'd do
in a situation like this.

1328
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,290
I must say you passed the test
with flying colors.

1329
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:10,689
That's something I'd expect
from someone Wilmer's age.

1330
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:13,419
This will soon be yours.
You might as well take it.

1331
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,092
I ought to have more than $10,000.

1332
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:17,410
You understand this is the first payment.
Later.

1333
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:20,094
Oh, yes. Later you'll give me millions,
but...

1334
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:21,852
...how's about $15,000 now?

1335
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:25,531
Frankly and candidly,
upon my word of honor as a gentleman...

1336
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:28,295
...$10,000 is all the money I can raise.

1337
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,531
But you didn't say positively.

1338
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:32,975
Positively.

1339
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:40,415
I'd like to give you a word of advice.

1340
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,489
Go ahead.

1341
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:44,499
You'll give her some money...

1342
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:48,971
...but if you don't give her what she thinks
she should have, be careful.

1343
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:53,689
Dangerous?

1344
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:55,495
Very.

1345
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:59,573
- How's the coffee coming, angel?
- In a few minutes.

1346
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:01,571
It's almost daylight, Mr. Spade.

1347
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:03,977
Can you start getting it now?

1348
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,489
I guess so.

1349
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,210
Hello.

1350
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:22,573
Hello, precious.
I'm sorry to get you up so early.

1351
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:25,170
Now, listen carefully. Here's the plot:

1352
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:29,094
In the Holland box, at the post office
there's an envelope with my scrawl.

1353
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:33,579
In that envelope, there's a parcel-room
check for the bundle we got yesterday.

1354
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:37,099
Now, get that bundle
and bring it here, p.d.q.

1355
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:40,139
That's a good girl. Now, hustle. Good-bye.

1356
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:29,970
Thanks, lady.
Sorry to spoil your day of rest.

1357
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:32,096
Not the first one you've spoiled.
Anything else?

1358
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:33,215
No. No, thanks.

1359
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,699
Bye-bye, then.

1360
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:54,688
There you are.

1361
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:08,449
Now, after 17 years!

1362
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:46,695
It is it.

1363
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:49,773
But we'll make sure.

1364
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:07,815
Fake.

1365
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,976
It's a phony! It's lead!

1366
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:11,495
It's lead!

1367
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:13,175
It's a fake!

1368
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:16,649
You've had your little joke.
Now, tell us about it.

1369
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:18,059
No, Sam! No!

1370
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,695
That's the one I got from Kemidov.
I swear it!

1371
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:21,735
You.

1372
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:24,772
It's you who bungled it.

1373
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:28,128
You and your stupid attempt to buy it!

1374
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:31,168
Kemidov found out how valuable it was!

1375
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:33,935
No wonder we had
such an easy time stealing it!

1376
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:35,419
You... you imbecile!

1377
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,092
You bloated idiot!

1378
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:39,537
You stupid fathead, you!

1379
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:09,812
Yes, it's the Russian's hand.
There's no doubt about it.

1380
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:11,094
What do you suggest...

1381
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:13,819
...we stand here, shed tears
and call each other names...

1382
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,731
...or shall we go to Istanbul?

1383
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:18,699
Are you going?

1384
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:22,769
Seventeen years I've wanted that item,
and have been trying to get it.

1385
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:25,328
If we must spend another year
on the quest...

1386
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:29,254
...well, sir, it will be an additional
expenditure in time of only...

1387
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:32,495
...five and fifteen-seventeenths percent.

1388
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,458
I'm going with you.

1389
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:51,175
Wilmer!

1390
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:55,538
A swell lot of thieves.

1391
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:58,612
We've little to boast about,
but the world hasn't come to an end...

1392
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:00,611
...just because we've run into a setback.

1393
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:03,931
- I must ask for that envelope.
- I held up my end. You got your dingus.

1394
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:06,215
It's your hard luck
it wasn't what you wanted.

1395
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,211
Now, come, sir, we've all failed...

1396
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:12,134
...and there's no reason for expecting
any of us to bear the whole brunt.

1397
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:15,014
In short, sir, I must ask you for my $10,000.

1398
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:21,529
This'll take care of my time and expenses.

1399
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,377
Now, sir, we'll say goodbye to you...

1400
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:29,770
...unless you care to undertake
the Istanbul expedition with us.

1401
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:30,895
You don't?

1402
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:33,455
Frankly, sir, I'd like to have you along.

1403
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:36,054
You're a man
of nice judgement and many resources.

1404
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:39,450
Since there's no alternative,
you'll manage the police without a fall guy.

1405
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:40,689
I'll make out all right.

1406
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:43,692
Well, sir, the shortest farewells
are the best. <i>Adieu</i>.

1407
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:51,249
And to you, Miss O'Shaughnessy,
I leave the rara avis on the table there...

1408
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:52,898
...as a little memento.

1409
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,331
Hello. Sergeant Polhaus there?

1410
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,770
Yeah. Put him on. This is Sam Spade.

1411
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:21,177
Hello. Tom? Now, listen.
I've got something for you. Here it is:

1412
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:24,218
Jacoby and Thursby were killed
by a kid named Wilmer Cook.

1413
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,576
Yeah. He's about 20 years old, 5-foot-6,
wearing a gray overcoat.

1414
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:29,936
He's working for a man named
Kasper Gutman.

1415
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:32,534
You can't miss Gutman.
He must weigh 300 pounds.

1416
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:34,417
That fellow Cairo's in with him, too.

1417
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:36,218
They just left for the Alexandria Hotel.

1418
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:38,495
You'll have to move fast.
They're blowing town.

1419
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:40,616
Watch yourself when you go up
against the kid.

1420
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,338
Yes, that's right. Very.

1421
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:43,899
Well, good luck, Tom.

1422
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:46,136
They'll talk when they're nailed about us.

1423
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:49,496
We only have minutes to get set
for the police. Give me all of it fast!

1424
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:52,219
When you first came to me,
why did you want Thursby shadowed?

1425
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:54,370
I thought he betrayed me.
I wanted to find out.

1426
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:57,452
A lie! You knew you had Thursby hooked!
You wanted to kill him...

1427
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:01,658
...before Jacoby came with the loot so you
wouldn't have to split it with him. Right?

1428
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:04,573
If he knew someone was following him,
he'd be frightened away.

1429
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:07,254
Miles wasn't clumsy enough
to be spotted the first night.

1430
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:09,570
You told Thursby he was being followed.

1431
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:13,095
I told him.

1432
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:15,529
I told him.

1433
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:17,849
Yes, but please believe me.

1434
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:20,215
I wouldn't have if I thought
Floyd would kill him.

1435
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:22,609
If you thought he wouldn't kill Miles,
you were right.

1436
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:24,895
Miles hadn't many brains,
but too much experience...

1437
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:27,540
...as a detective to be caught
by a man he was shadowing...

1438
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:30,293
...up a blind alley with his gun
and his overcoat buttoned.

1439
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:32,655
But he'd have gone up there
with you, angel.

1440
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:34,856
He was just dumb enough for that.

1441
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:38,138
He'd have looked you up and down,
licked his lips and gone...

1442
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:39,972
...grinning from ear to ear.

1443
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:42,409
You could have stood
as close to him as you liked...

1444
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,889
...and shot him with a gun you got
from Thursby that night.

1445
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:47,653
- Don't say that!
- The police'll be here any minute! Talk!

1446
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:48,695
Why do you accuse me...

1447
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:52,489
It's not the time for that schoolgirl act!
We're both sitting under the gallows!

1448
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:54,059
Now, why did you shoot Miles?

1449
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:58,099
I didn't mean to at first, really, I didn't.

1450
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:01,973
But when I found out
that Floyd couldn't be frightened...

1451
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:04,016
I can't look at you and tell you this!

1452
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:06,978
You thought Thursby would tackle Miles
and one would go down.

1453
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:08,698
If Thursby died, you were rid of him.

1454
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:10,736
If it was Miles,
you'd see Thursby was caught.

1455
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:12,048
- Right?
- Something like that.

1456
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:13,892
When Thursby wouldn't tackle him...

1457
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:16,096
...you took his gun
and did it yourself, right?

1458
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:18,330
When you heard Thursby was shot,
you knew Gutman was here!

1459
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:20,138
You knew you needed another protector...

1460
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:23,257
...somebody to fill Thursby's boots,
so you came back to me.

1461
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:26,059
Yes! Sweetheart, it wasn't only that!

1462
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:28,856
I'd have come back to you sooner or later.

1463
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:31,500
From the very first instant I saw you,
I knew.

1464
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:37,732
Well, if you get a good break,
you'll be out of Tehachapi in 20 years...

1465
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:40,056
...and you can come back to me then.

1466
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:43,497
I hope they don't hang you, precious,
by that sweet neck.

1467
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,938
- You're not...
- Yes, angel, I'm gonna send you over.

1468
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:51,250
The chances are you'll get off with life.

1469
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:53,808
If you're a good girl,
you'll be out in 20 years.

1470
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:55,492
I'll be waiting for you.

1471
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:58,048
If they hang you, I'll always remember you.

1472
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:01,939
Don't, Sam!

1473
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:04,132
Don't say that, even in fun!

1474
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:08,891
I was frightened for a minute.
I really thought...

1475
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:11,735
You do such wild and unpredictable things.

1476
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,253
Now, don't be silly.

1477
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:15,138
You're taking the fall.

1478
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,891
You've been playing with me...

1479
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:26,059
...just pretending you cared
to trap me like this.

1480
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:27,698
You didn't care at all!

1481
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:30,013
You don't love me!

1482
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:31,977
I won't play the sap for you!

1483
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:33,539
You know it's not like that!

1484
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:36,612
You never played square with me
since I've known you!

1485
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:40,056
You know in your heart that
in spite of anything I've done, I love you.

1486
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:42,131
I don't care who loves who!
I won't play the sap!

1487
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:45,530
I won't walk in Thursby's, and I don't know
how many others' footsteps!

1488
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:48,134
You killed Miles
and you're going over for it.

1489
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:02,771
How can you do this to me, Sam?

1490
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:06,854
Surely, Mr. Archer wasn't
as much to you as...

1491
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:20,295
Listen.

1492
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:22,858
This won't do any good.

1493
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:27,250
You'll never understand me,
but I'll try once and then give it up.

1494
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:30,457
When a man's partner is killed,
he's supposed to do something.

1495
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:32,656
It makes no difference
what you thought of him.

1496
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:36,130
He was your partner, and you're supposed
to do something about it...

1497
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:39,259
...and it happens we're
in the detective business.

1498
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:42,377
Well, when one of your organization
gets killed, it's...

1499
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:45,692
...it's bad business to let the killer
get away with it...

1500
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:48,294
...bad all around,
bad for every detective everywhere.

1501
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:52,055
You don't expect me to think that these
are sufficient reasons for sending me...

1502
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:54,574
Wait'll I'm through. Then, you can talk.

1503
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:56,696
I've no earthly reason to think
I can trust you.

1504
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:59,692
If I do this and get away with it,
you'll have something on me...

1505
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:01,896
...that you can use whenever you want to.

1506
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:03,413
Since I've got something on you...

1507
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:06,890
...I couldn't be sure that you wouldn't
put a hole in me someday.

1508
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:09,018
All those are on one side.

1509
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:12,617
Maybe some of them are unimportant.
I won't argue about that.

1510
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:15,491
But look at the number of them.

1511
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:18,292
What have we got on the other side?

1512
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:22,009
All we've got is that maybe you love me
and maybe I love you.

1513
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:25,696
You know whether you love me or not.

1514
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:31,931
Maybe I do. I'll have some rotten nights
after I've sent you over, but that'll pass.

1515
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:38,810
If all I've said doesn't mean anything
to you...

1516
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,414
...then forget it and we'll make it just this:

1517
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:44,936
I won't, because all of me wants to
regardless of consequences...

1518
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:46,778
...and because you've counted on it...

1519
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:49,215
...the same as you counted on it
with all the others.

1520
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:52,576
Would you have done this if the falcon
were real and you got your money?

1521
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:55,220
Don't be too sure I'm as crooked
as I'm supposed to be.

1522
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:57,609
That sort of reputation might be
good business...

1523
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:01,579
...bringing high-priced jobs and making it
easier to deal with the enemy...

1524
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:06,616
...but a lot more money would have been
one more item on your side of the scales.

1525
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:10,170
If you'd loved me, you wouldn't have
needed any more on that side.

1526
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:22,655
Come in.

1527
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:29,098
Hello, Tom. Got 'em?

1528
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:30,215
Got 'em.

1529
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:33,531
Swell! Here's another one for you.
She killed Miles.

1530
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:37,776
Oh, and I've got some exhibits:
The boy's guns, one of Cairo's...

1531
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:40,579
...and a $1,000 bill I was supposed
to be bribed with...

1532
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:44,091
...and this black statuette here
that all the fuss was about.

1533
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:47,618
What's the matter with your playmate?
He looks brokenhearted.

1534
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:50,089
I bet when he heard Gutman's story,
he thought he had me.

1535
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,329
Cut it out, Sam.

1536
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:55,374
Well, shall we be getting down to the Hall?

1537
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:07,329
It's heavy.

1538
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:09,209
What is it?

1539
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:16,457
The stuff that dreams are made of.

1540
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:52,778
The Maltese Falcon (1941) DVDRip (SiRiUs sHaRe)

1541
