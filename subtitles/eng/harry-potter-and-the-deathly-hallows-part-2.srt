00:00:06,046 --> 00:00:09,012
This sub is a RE-SYNC from TS version

2
00:00:09,047 --> 00:00:12,047
So don't expect a perfect sub or timing,

3
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:15,048
 and bitching about it in the comment

4
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:18,048
brought to you by waduk

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,074
www.seedr.co.il - come visit to stream 
your torrents with subtitles search

6
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,789
It's beautiful here.

7
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:31,215
It was our aunt's.
We used to come here as kids.

8
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:34,249
The Order uses it now as a safe house.

9
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,601
What's left of us atleast.

10
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:42,076
Muggles think these
things keep evil away.

11
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:44,111
But they're wrong.

12
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:48,048
I need to talk to the Goblin.

13
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,005
How are you?

14
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:23,818
- You buried the elf?
- Yes.

15
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:25,604
And brought me here.

16
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:29,225
You are...

17
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:33,181
Pretty unusual, is it?

18
00:03:40,527 --> 00:03:42,121
How did you come by the sword?

19
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:48,497
It's complicated.

20
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,615
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think
it should be in her vault at Gringotts?

21
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,611
It's complicated.

22
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:03,813
The sword presented itself to us,
in moment of need.

23
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:05,254
We didn't steal it.

24
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,774
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault
identical to this one.

25
00:04:11,774 --> 00:04:13,186
But it is a fake.

26
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,596
It was placed there this past summer.

27
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:17,094
And she never suspected it was a fake.

28
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:18,870
The replica is very convincing.

29
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,251
Only a goblin would recognize that
this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.

30
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:23,701
Who is the acquaintance?

31
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:25,727
A Hogwarts Professor.

32
00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:28,694
As I understand that he's now Headmaster.

33
00:04:29,414 --> 00:04:30,730
Snape.

34
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,851
He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault.

35
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:35,829
Why?

36
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:39,583
There are more than a fewcurious things
in the vaults at Gringotts.

37
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:43,530
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?

38
00:04:46,814 --> 00:04:47,582
Perhaps.

39
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,123
I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.

40
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,791
- It is impossible.
- Alone, yes.

41
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,385
But with you, no.

42
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:06,586
- Why should I help you?
- I have gold.

43
00:05:07,412 --> 00:05:08,315
Lots of....

44
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:09,707
I've no interest in gold.

45
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,282
Then what?

46
00:05:16,294 --> 00:05:17,139
That.

47
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:19,713
That is my price.

48
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:35,164
Are you thinking there's a
Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

49
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:37,612
Well, she was terrified when she
thought we had been in there.

50
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:40,119
She kept asking you,
what else was taken?

51
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:42,942
I bet you anything, there's Horcrux in there.
Another piece of his soul.

52
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:46,005
Let's find it, kill it, and we are
one step closer to killing him.

53
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:46,965
And what happens when we find it,

54
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:50,163
How're we supposed to destroy it, now you're giving the sword to Griphook?

55
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:52,890
I'm still working on that part.

56
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,731
He's weak.

57
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:06,987
Who?

58
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:09,935
Mr. Ollivander

59
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:13,008
I need to ask you a few questions.

60
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:14,938
Anything, m'boy.
Anything!

61
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:21,199
Would you mind identifying this wand?
We need to know if it's safe to use.

62
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:29,217
Uhh... Walnut

63
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:31,839
Dragon Heartstring

64
00:06:33,404 --> 00:06:35,200
12 and three quarter inches.

65
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:38,368
Unyie...

66
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:41,797
Unyielding.

67
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:47,078
This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.

68
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:49,411
Treat it carefully.

69
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:51,937
And this?

70
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:56,642
Hawthorn.

71
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,387
An unicorn hair.

72
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:02,462
10 inches.

73
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:04,862
Reasonably pliant.

74
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,458
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

75
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:15,569
Was?

76
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:16,808
Is it not still?

77
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:19,602
Well, perhaps not.
If you won it from him.

78
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,181
I sense its allegiance has changed.

79
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:35,043
You talk about wands,
as if they have feelings...

80
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,222
.......can think!

81
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,366
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.

82
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:51,224
That much has always been clear to
those of us who've studied wandlore.

83
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,622
And, what do you know about the Deathly Hallows?

84
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:02,805
It is rumored there are three.

85
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:12,811
The Elder Wand, the Cloak of Invisibility,
to hide you from your enemies...

86
00:08:13,656 --> 00:08:18,447
and the Resurrection Stone, to bring
back loved ones from the dead.

87
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:23,335
Together, they make one the Master of Death.

88
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:30,163
But, few truly believe that such objects exist.

89
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:30,960
Do you?

90
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:34,484
Do you believe they exist, sir?

91
00:08:36,088 --> 00:08:37,297
Well...

92
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:43,280
I see no reason to put
stock into an old wives' tale.

93
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:45,047
You're lying!

94
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,379
You know one exists.

95
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:53,526
You told him about it.
You told him about the Elder Wand...

96
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:55,965
and where he could go looking for it.

97
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:00,805
He tortured me.

98
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:05,395
Besides...

99
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:08,727
....I only conveyed rumors.

100
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:11,838
There's...

101
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,409
There's no telling whether he will find it.

102
00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:21,153
He has found it, sir.

103
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:28,460
We'll let you rest.

104
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:33,560
He's after you, Mr. Potter.

105
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:36,700
If it's true what you say,

106
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:38,851
that he has the Elder Wand,

107
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:42,749
I'm afraid,

108
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:46,446
...you really don't stand a chance.

109
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:50,009
Well, I am supposed to kill him, before he finds me, then.

110
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:57,787
You're sure that's hers?

111
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:00,725
Positive.

112
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:08,840
Well?

113
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,144
How do I look?

114
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,631
Hideous.

115
00:10:14,707 --> 00:10:16,964
You can give that to Hermione to hold.
Alright, Griphook?

116
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:37,763
We're relying on you, Griphook.

117
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,077
If you get us past the guards into the vault...

118
00:10:40,077 --> 00:10:41,230
The sword's yours.

119
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:54,712
Madam Lestrange.

120
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:55,797
Good morning.

121
00:10:58,053 --> 00:11:00,838
Good morning?
Good morning?

122
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:04,410
You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not a school girl!

123
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,668
Hey!
Easy!

124
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:10,729
If she gives us away, we must swear
to use that sword to slit our own throats.

125
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:12,169
Understand?

126
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:13,648
No, he's right.

127
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:15,626
I speak stupid.

128
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,834
Okay.
Let's do it.

129
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:24,180
I wish to enter my vault.

130
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,480
Identification?

131
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,925
I hardly think that would be necessary.

132
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:39,179
Madam Lestrange.

133
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,391
I don't like to be kept waiting.

134
00:12:47,024 --> 00:12:48,378
<i>I know...</i>

135
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,193
<i>They know she's an impostor.</i>

136
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,148
<i>They'd be warned.</i>

137
00:13:03,128 --> 00:13:03,944
Harry...

138
00:13:05,404 --> 00:13:06,115
What do we do, Harry?

139
00:13:12,231 --> 00:13:15,986
Madam Lestrange,
would you mind presenting your wand?

140
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:18,483
And why should I do that?

141
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:23,735
It's the bank's policy!
I'm sure you understand, given current climate.

142
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:26,972
No! I most certainly do not understand!

143
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,237
I'm afraid, I must insist.

144
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:37,294
<i>Imperio!</i>

145
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:44,852
Very well, Madam Lestrange.

146
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,532
If you would follow me?

147
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:22,811
What is that, Griphook?

148
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:29,322
Griphook!

149
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:48,748
<i>Aresto Momentum</i>

150
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,836
Well done, Hermione.

151
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:04,496
Oh no, you two're like you again.

152
00:15:05,553 --> 00:15:08,433
The Thief's Downfall,
washes away all enchantments.

153
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:09,989
Can be deadly.

154
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:11,065
You don't say.

155
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,349
Just out of interest,
is there any other way out of here?

156
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:16,164
No.

157
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:20,542
What the devil are all you doing down here?

158
00:15:21,272 --> 00:15:22,732
Thieves!

159
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:23,222
You gave up the.....

160
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,019
<i>- Imperio
- You!</i>

161
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:36,646
That doesn't sound good.

162
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:48,678
Bloody hell!

163
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:50,368
It's an Ukrainian Ironbelly.

164
00:15:50,378 --> 00:15:51,751
Here.

165
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:04,936
It's been trained to expect pain
when it hears this noise.

166
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:06,962
That's barbaric!

167
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,797
Lumos.

168
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:42,280
Blimey!

169
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,172
Accio Horcrux!

170
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:55,244
You seem you're gonna try
this here, won't you?

171
00:16:55,244 --> 00:16:57,088
No kind of magic would work in here.

172
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:03,080
It's in here, Harry?

173
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:05,672
Can you feel anything?

174
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,084
That's it!
Up there!

175
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:35,930
They have added the Gemino curse.
Everything you touch will multiply.

176
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:36,833
Give me the sword.

177
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,144
Stop moving!

178
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:18,489
Do it!

179
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:24,107
- We had a deal, Griphook!
- The cup for the sword!

180
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:34,334
I said I'll get you in,
I didn't say anything about getting you out.

181
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:58,427
Griphook! Thieves!
Griphook!

182
00:18:58,427 --> 00:18:59,330
Hey, thieves!

183
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,265
Is that okay?

184
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:06,023
We've still got Bogrod.

185
00:19:12,764 --> 00:19:14,060
That's unfortunate.

186
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,590
We can't just stand here,
You got any idea?

187
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,550
Should be a brilliant one.

188
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:24,056
I've got something,
but it's mad!

189
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:25,871
<i>Reducto</i>

190
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:39,190
Well, come on, then!

191
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,878
<i>Relashio</i>

192
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,316
Keep moving!

193
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:56,348
Now what?

194
00:20:56,348 --> 00:20:57,942
<i>Reducto</i>

195
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:00,160
Hold on.

196
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:12,912
That was brilliant!
Absolutely brilliant!

197
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:41,788
We're dropping!

198
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:46,666
- I say we jump!
- When?

199
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:47,664
Now!

200
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:41,199
He knows.

201
00:22:42,217 --> 00:22:42,697
You-Know-Who.

202
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:45,232
He knows we broke into Gringotts.

203
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:48,017
He knows what we took,
and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.

204
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:50,005
- How is it you know?
- I saw him.

205
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:53,164
You let him in?
Harry, you can't do that!

206
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,720
Hermione, I can't always help it!

207
00:22:55,056 --> 00:22:56,362
Well, maybe I can.
I don't know!

208
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:57,966
Never mind!
What happened?

209
00:22:58,311 --> 00:22:59,828
Well, he's angry...

210
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,576
and scared too.

211
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:04,899
He knows, if we find and destroy
all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him.

212
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,087
I reckon he'll stop at nothing
to make sure we don't find the rest.

213
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:11,006
And there's more.

214
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,062
One of them is at Hogwarts.

215
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,109
What?

216
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:14,809
You saw it?

217
00:23:14,943 --> 00:23:15,836
I saw the castle.

218
00:23:15,836 --> 00:23:17,046
And Rowena Ravenclaw.

219
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:18,218
It must have something to do with her.

220
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:19,562
We have to go there, now!

221
00:23:19,562 --> 00:23:20,647
Well, we can't do that!

222
00:23:21,396 --> 00:23:23,115
We've got to plan,
we've got to figure it out!

223
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:25,756
Hermione, when have any of
our plans ever actually worked?

224
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:28,233
We plan, we get there,
all hell breaks loose.

225
00:23:29,481 --> 00:23:31,498
He's right!
One problem...

226
00:23:32,132 --> 00:23:34,840
Snape's Headmaster now,
we can't just move freely from the front door!

227
00:23:36,146 --> 00:23:38,594
Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,

228
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:39,785
to Honeydukes.

229
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,341
Take the secret passage in the cellar.

230
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,800
It's...

231
00:23:43,136 --> 00:23:44,606
There's something wrong with him.

232
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:46,238
It's like, you know,

233
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:46,939
in the past...

234
00:23:47,765 --> 00:23:49,407
I've always been able
to follow his thoughts.

235
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:51,731
And now everything just feels disconnected.

236
00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:55,178
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.
Maybe he's getting weaker.

237
00:23:55,178 --> 00:23:55,870
Maybe he's dying!

238
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,734
No!

239
00:23:57,118 --> 00:23:58,885
No, it's.. It's more like he's wounded.

240
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:01,055
If anything, he feels more dangerous.

241
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:51,479
- Right here. Come on!
- Search everywhere.

242
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:52,727
Go, move!

243
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:12,547
Faster!

244
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:25,914
In here, Potter.

245
00:25:30,658 --> 00:25:31,752
<i>Come on, move!</i>

246
00:25:37,888 --> 00:25:39,751
Did you look at him.

247
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:42,872
- For a second I thought that was...
- I know. Dumbledore!

248
00:25:58,476 --> 00:25:59,658
Harry?

249
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:03,220
I can see you in this.

250
00:26:16,654 --> 00:26:19,218
Bloody fools, what are you thinking coming here?

251
00:26:19,218 --> 00:26:21,830
Have you any idea how dangerous it is?

252
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,404
You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.

253
00:26:25,729 --> 00:26:27,448
It's you who I've been seeing in here.

254
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:29,484
You're the one who sent Dobby.

255
00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:32,287
- Why've you left him?
- He's dead.

256
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:35,380
Sorry to hear it.
I liked that elf.

257
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,589
Who gave that to you?

258
00:26:36,993 --> 00:26:37,655
The mirror?

259
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,218
Mundungus Fletcher, about a year ago.

260
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:42,908
Dung had no right selling that to you.
It belongs to...

261
00:26:42,908 --> 00:26:43,513
Sirius...

262
00:26:44,877 --> 00:26:46,557
Albus told me.

263
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:50,350
He also told me you'd likely be hacked off,

264
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,472
...if you ever found that I had it.
But, ask yourself;

265
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:54,921
Where would you be if I didn't?

266
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:00,596
Do you have any others much?

267
00:27:00,596 --> 00:27:01,307
From the Order?

268
00:27:02,027 --> 00:27:03,285
The Order has finished.

269
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,129
You-Know-Who has won,

270
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:08,720
...anyone who says otherwise
is killing themselves.

271
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,121
We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.

272
00:27:11,774 --> 00:27:13,012
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

273
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:14,165
Did he now...

274
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:17,353
Nice job?
Easy?

275
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:19,513
We've been hunting Horcruxes.

276
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,865
We think the last one's inside the castle.

277
00:27:22,865 --> 00:27:24,036
But we'll need your help getting in.

278
00:27:24,046 --> 00:27:27,877
Which job my brother has given you, it's a suicide mission.

279
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:30,278
Do yourself a favor, boy.
Go home!

280
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:31,402
Live a little longer.

281
00:27:31,402 --> 00:27:33,159
Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.

282
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:34,666
What makes you think you can trust him?

283
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:38,594
What makes you think you can
believe anything my brother told you?

284
00:27:38,594 --> 00:27:39,871
And in all the time you knew him...

285
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,868
Did he ever mention my name?

286
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,009
Did he ever mentioned hers?

287
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:47,160
- Why should he...
- Keep secrets.

288
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,245
You tell me?

289
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:52,527
- I trusted him.
- That's a boy's answer.

290
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:58,443
A boy goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of
a man who wouldn't even tell him where to start.

291
00:27:58,481 --> 00:27:59,384
You're lying!

292
00:27:59,998 --> 00:28:03,542
Not just on me, it doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.

293
00:28:03,772 --> 00:28:05,213
That's what a fool does.

294
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,611
You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter!

295
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:13,183
So, I ask you again, there must be a reason.

296
00:28:16,092 --> 00:28:18,378
I'm not interested in what happened
between you and your brother.

297
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:21,479
I don't care that you've given up.

298
00:28:24,562 --> 00:28:26,127
I trusted the man I knew.

299
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,783
We need to get into the castle tonight.

300
00:28:38,121 --> 00:28:39,532
You know what to do.

301
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:47,820
Where have you sent her?

302
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:49,654
You'll see.

303
00:28:50,672 --> 00:28:51,910
Soon enough.

304
00:28:58,325 --> 00:29:00,111
That's your sister, Ariana.
Isn't it?

305
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:03,683
She died very young, didn't she?

306
00:29:05,508 --> 00:29:08,753
My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter.

307
00:29:09,368 --> 00:29:11,116
On his journey to find power.

308
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:13,180
Including Ariana.

309
00:29:14,438 --> 00:29:16,243
And she was devoted to him.

310
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:19,182
He gave her everything.

311
00:29:20,766 --> 00:29:22,245
But time.

312
00:29:23,983 --> 00:29:25,424
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

313
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:34,383
He did save our lives twice!

314
00:29:35,756 --> 00:29:37,196
Kept an eye on us on that mirror.

315
00:29:39,107 --> 00:29:41,047
That doesn't seem like someone who's given up!

316
00:29:47,183 --> 00:29:48,624
She's coming back.

317
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:51,101
What's that with her?

318
00:29:58,668 --> 00:29:59,888
Neville!

319
00:29:59,888 --> 00:30:01,952
- How you look...
- Like hell, I reckon.

320
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:03,201
But this is nothing.

321
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:04,852
Seamus is worse.

322
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:05,937
Hey, Ab!

323
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:07,992
We've got a couple more coming through.

324
00:30:09,615 --> 00:30:11,785
Don't remember this on the Marauder's Map.

325
00:30:11,785 --> 00:30:13,629
That's because it never existed till now.

326
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,865
The seven secret passages were sealed off,
before the start of the year.

327
00:30:17,403 --> 00:30:18,699
This is the only way in or out, now.

328
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:21,859
The grounds are crawled with Death Eaters and Dementors.

329
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:23,510
How about Mr.Snape as Headmaster?

330
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:24,586
Hardly ever seen.

331
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:26,276
It's the Carrows who's watching out for.

332
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:27,755
Carrows?

333
00:30:27,764 --> 00:30:30,184
Yeah. Brother and sister.
Incharge of discipline.

334
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,383
They like punishment, the Carrows.

335
00:30:32,383 --> 00:30:33,209
They did that to you?

336
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:34,496
Why?

337
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,453
Today's Dark Arts lesson was
practicing the Cruciatus curse.

338
00:30:37,847 --> 00:30:38,942
On first years.

339
00:30:40,094 --> 00:30:40,843
I refused.

340
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:43,801
Hogwarts has changed.

341
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,349
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?

342
00:31:04,418 --> 00:31:05,935
Hey, you lots! It's

343
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:07,423
for your surprise.

344
00:31:07,423 --> 00:31:09,209
No more about Aberforth's cook's gonna help.

345
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:11,149
We'll be surprised if it's just digested.

346
00:31:13,434 --> 00:31:16,229
- Oh my!
- Harry!

347
00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:31,699
Get the word out to Remus and the others, that Harry is back.

348
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:33,302
Okay, okay!

349
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:35,165
Let's not kill him before You-Know-Who does.

350
00:31:35,165 --> 00:31:39,237
...Do you read? We've a new weather report.
Lightning has struck. I repeat: Lightning has struck.

351
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:40,639
What's the fun, Harry?

352
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,352
Okay.

353
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:48,849
There's something we need to find.

354
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,576
There's something hidden here, in the castle.

355
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,823
And it may help us to defeat
You-Know-Who.

356
00:31:54,505 --> 00:31:57,203
- Alright, what is it?
- We don't know.

357
00:31:59,537 --> 00:32:01,361
- Where is it?
- We don't know that either.

358
00:32:03,752 --> 00:32:04,914
I realize that's not much to go on.

359
00:32:05,078 --> 00:32:05,894
That's nothing to go on.

360
00:32:07,017 --> 00:32:09,024
I think it has something to do with Ravenclaw.

361
00:32:09,591 --> 00:32:13,595
It'll be small, easily concealed.

362
00:32:14,738 --> 00:32:16,015
Anyone, any ideas?

363
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:20,634
Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem.

364
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:21,796
Oh, bloody hell!
Here we go!

365
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,560
Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?

366
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,010
Hasn't anyone heard of it?

367
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:28,911
It's quite famous.

368
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:31,245
Yes. But, Luna, it's lost.

369
00:32:31,831 --> 00:32:34,990
For centuries.
There's no person alive today who's seen it.

370
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:37,928
Excuse me, can someone tell me what bloody diadem is?

371
00:32:37,928 --> 00:32:39,359
It's a sort of crown.

372
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:40,713
You know, like a tiara.

373
00:32:43,824 --> 00:32:44,679
Harry!

374
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,377
Hi, there.

375
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:53,485
Six months she doesn't see me and
it's like I'm a frankie first-year.

376
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:54,503
I'm her brother!

377
00:32:54,503 --> 00:32:57,326
- She's got lots of them, but she's got only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus!

378
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:58,440
What is it, Ginny?

379
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:03,011
Snape knows... he knows
that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.

380
00:33:41,143 --> 00:33:45,291
Many of you are surely wondering,
why I have summoned you at this hour.

381
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:51,187
It's come to my attention,
that earlier this evening...

382
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,892
Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.

383
00:33:58,034 --> 00:33:59,273
Now...

384
00:34:00,194 --> 00:34:01,260
should anyone...

385
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:08,078
student or staff attempt to aid Mr. Potter?

386
00:34:09,269 --> 00:34:17,297
They will be punished in a manner consistent with
the severity of their transcription, further more...

387
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:21,791
Any person found to have
knowledge of these events...

388
00:34:23,913 --> 00:34:27,658
who fails to come forward...

389
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:36,243
will be treated as equally guilty.

390
00:34:39,066 --> 00:34:39,863
Another...

391
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:52,231
If anyone in here has any knowledge of
Mr. Potter's movements this evening.

392
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,542
I invite them to step forward.

393
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:02,929
Now!

394
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:21,548
It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies,

395
00:35:21,558 --> 00:35:23,661
...you still have a security problem, Headmaster.

396
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,096
I'm afraid it's quite extensive.

397
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:32,697
How dare you stand where he stood?

398
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:38,449
Tell them how it happened that night?
Tell them how you looked him in the eye...

399
00:35:38,756 --> 00:35:40,840
A man who trusted you, and killed him.

400
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,501
Tell them!

401
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,025
COWARD!

402
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:19,174
<i>Harry.</i>

403
00:36:19,865 --> 00:36:20,883
Potter?

404
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:58,286
<i>I know that many of you will want to fight.</i>

405
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:03,567
<i>Some of you may even think that to fight is wise.</i>

406
00:37:04,364 --> 00:37:06,649
<i>But this is folly.</i>

407
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:10,615
<i>Give me Harry Potter.</i>

408
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:15,263
<i>Do this and none shall be harmed.</i>

409
00:37:15,263 --> 00:37:21,735
<i>Give me Harry Potter,
and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.</i>

410
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:28,063
<i>Give me Harry Potter,
and you will be rewarded.</i>

411
00:37:28,063 --> 00:37:30,944
<i>You have one hour.</i>

412
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:44,071
What're you waiting for?
Someone grab him!

413
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,659
Students out of bed!

414
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:59,963
Students in the corridor!

415
00:37:59,963 --> 00:38:02,537
They're supposed to be out of bed,
you blithering idiot!

416
00:38:06,215 --> 00:38:06,993
Sorry ma'am.

417
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,932
As it happens, Mr. Filch...

418
00:38:08,932 --> 00:38:10,498
Your arrival is most opportune.

419
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:17,671
If you would, I would like you please, to lead Miss Parkinson
and the rest of Slytherin house, from the hall.

420
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,427
Exactly where is it I'll be leading 'em to, ma'am?

421
00:38:20,427 --> 00:38:21,906
The dungeons would do.

422
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,847
I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter.

423
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:31,028
What is it you need?

424
00:38:31,028 --> 00:38:33,726
Time, Professor.
As much as you can get me.

425
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:35,455
Do what you have to do.

426
00:38:35,455 --> 00:38:37,078
I'll secure the castle.

427
00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:39,670
Potter...

428
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,983
It's good to see you.

429
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,989
It's good to see you too, Professor.

430
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,361
Hold the fort, Neville.

431
00:39:00,652 --> 00:39:01,248
Harry!

432
00:39:02,122 --> 00:39:04,647
Hermione and I've been thinking,
it doesn't matter if we find a Horcrux.

433
00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:05,790
What do you mean?

434
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:07,201
Unless we can destroy it.

435
00:39:07,624 --> 00:39:08,863
So, we were thinking...

436
00:39:08,863 --> 00:39:10,447
Well, Ron was thinking, it was Ron's idea.

437
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,254
It was completely brilliant

438
00:39:11,254 --> 00:39:13,299
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
with a Basilisk's fang, right?

439
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:16,890
Well, me and Hermione did remind
where we might find one.

440
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:17,735
Okay.

441
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,858
Okay, but take this.

442
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,826
That way, you can find me when you get back.

443
00:39:22,441 --> 00:39:23,209
Where're you going?

444
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:25,667
Ravenclaw common room,
Gotta start somewhere.

445
00:39:31,784 --> 00:39:32,658
Harry!

446
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:34,876
Harry!

447
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:36,710
Let me get this straight, Professor...

448
00:39:37,171 --> 00:39:38,996
You're actually giving us
permission to do this?

449
00:39:38,996 --> 00:39:41,204
That is correct, Longbottom.

450
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:42,366
To blow it up!
Boom!

451
00:39:42,366 --> 00:39:43,173
Boom!

452
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:45,238
Wicked!

453
00:39:45,612 --> 00:39:46,860
But how on earth are we gonna do that?

454
00:39:47,629 --> 00:39:49,597
Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan?

455
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:53,640
As I recall, he has a particular
proclivity for pyro-technics.

456
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,533
I can bring it down.

457
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:56,348
That's the spirit!
Well, you go.

458
00:39:57,923 --> 00:40:01,188
You do realize, of course, we can't
keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

459
00:40:01,351 --> 00:40:03,761
That doesn't mean
we can't delay him.

460
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:09,215
And his name is Voldemort.
Filius, you might as well use it.

461
00:40:09,215 --> 00:40:11,741
He's come to try to kill you, either way!

462
00:40:14,238 --> 00:40:17,349
<i>Piertotum Locomotor.</i>

463
00:40:32,502 --> 00:40:34,134
Hogwarts is threatened.

464
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:37,783
Man the boundaries! Protect us.
Do your duty...

465
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:39,195
....to our school.

466
00:40:43,122 --> 00:40:45,629
I always wanted to use that spell!

467
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,048
<i>Protego Maxima</i>

468
00:40:56,048 --> 00:40:57,017
<i>Fianto Duri</i>

469
00:40:57,017 --> 00:40:58,496
<i>Repello Inimigotum</i>

470
00:40:58,506 --> 00:40:59,591
<i>Protego Maxima</i>

471
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:01,819
<i>Fianto Duri</i>

472
00:41:02,136 --> 00:41:02,798
<i>Repello....</i>

473
00:41:02,856 --> 00:41:03,749
<i>Protego Maxima</i>

474
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:04,709
<i>Fianto Duri</i>

475
00:41:05,487 --> 00:41:06,447
<i>Repello Inimigotum</i>

476
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:08,646
<i>Protego Maxima</i>

477
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:37,233
Harry, wait!

478
00:41:37,944 --> 00:41:38,943
I need to talk to you!

479
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:41,727
- I'm a bit pre-occupied at the moment, Luna.
- You don't know anything where you're going.

480
00:41:41,891 --> 00:41:43,139
You're wasting your time!

481
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:44,339
Look, we'll talk later, okay?

482
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:45,396
- Harry?
- Later.

483
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,931
Harry Potter, you listen to me right now!

484
00:41:49,727 --> 00:41:52,924
Do you remember what Cho said
about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?

485
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:55,344
There is not a person alive who's seen it.

486
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:57,879
It's obvious, isn't it?

487
00:41:58,292 --> 00:41:59,973
We have to talk to someone who's dead.

488
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:12,206
It's very impressive, isn't it?

489
00:42:28,195 --> 00:42:31,306
If you want to find her,
you'll find her down there.

490
00:42:31,306 --> 00:42:32,410
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

491
00:42:32,689 --> 00:42:34,561
I think it's best if you two talk alone.

492
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:36,280
She's very shy.

493
00:43:02,649 --> 00:43:03,850
You're the Grey Lady.

494
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:06,308
The ghost of Ravenclaw tower.

495
00:43:06,836 --> 00:43:08,305
I do not answer to that name!

496
00:43:08,305 --> 00:43:10,014
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

497
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,474
It's Helena, isn't it?

498
00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:14,422
Helena Ravenclaw,
Rowena's daughter.

499
00:43:15,142 --> 00:43:17,111
Are you a friend of Luna's?

500
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,013
Yes.

501
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:20,875
And she thought you might be able to help me.

502
00:43:23,535 --> 00:43:25,523
You seek my mother's diadem?

503
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,279
Yes.

504
00:43:29,892 --> 00:43:30,679
That's right.

505
00:43:32,273 --> 00:43:34,108
Luna is kind.

506
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,652
Unlike so many of the others.

507
00:43:37,171 --> 00:43:40,445
But she was wrong,
I cannot help you!

508
00:43:44,296 --> 00:43:46,082
Wait, please!

509
00:43:48,464 --> 00:43:49,837
I want to destroy it!

510
00:44:27,642 --> 00:44:29,198
They never learn.

511
00:44:31,205 --> 00:44:32,425
Such a pity.

512
00:44:34,499 --> 00:44:35,449
My Lord...

513
00:44:36,727 --> 00:44:37,850
Shouldn't we wait?

514
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,001
Begin!

515
00:45:06,648 --> 00:45:08,636
I thought you want to do it.
Isn't it, Helena?

516
00:45:14,455 --> 00:45:15,877
You want it destroyed?

517
00:45:15,877 --> 00:45:18,402
Another promised
to destroy it many years ago.

518
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:21,446
A strange boy with a strange name?

519
00:45:21,782 --> 00:45:22,762
Tom Riddle.

520
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:23,933
But he lied.

521
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:25,854
He lied to many people.

522
00:45:25,863 --> 00:45:29,234
I know what he's done!
I know who he is!

523
00:45:29,234 --> 00:45:32,316
He defiled it, with dark magic!

524
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:47,469
I can destroy it.

525
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:49,102
Once and for all.

526
00:45:51,647 --> 00:45:53,586
But only if you tell me
where he hid it?

527
00:45:56,294 --> 00:45:59,425
You do know where he hid it?

528
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:01,259
Don't you, Helena?

529
00:46:03,439 --> 00:46:04,476
You just have to tell me.

530
00:46:06,915 --> 00:46:07,741
Please!

531
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,232
Strange!

532
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:27,119
You remind me of him a bit.

533
00:46:29,231 --> 00:46:31,997
It's here, in the castle.

534
00:46:33,092 --> 00:46:34,964
In the place where everything is hidden.

535
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,632
If you have to ask...

536
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:40,140
....you will never know.

537
00:46:41,984 --> 00:46:43,040
If you know...

538
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,605
...you need only ask.

539
00:46:46,612 --> 00:46:47,928
Thank you!

540
00:47:00,296 --> 00:47:03,753
Tell Professor McGonagall.
Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.

541
00:47:05,193 --> 00:47:06,490
Yes, sir!

542
00:47:10,398 --> 00:47:16,313
Hey Dean, with second thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall we
might need one or two more wands this side.

543
00:47:18,263 --> 00:47:21,566
It is the quality of one's convictions that determines one's success..

544
00:47:21,566 --> 00:47:22,843
...not the number of followers.

545
00:47:23,746 --> 00:47:25,081
Who said that?

546
00:47:25,935 --> 00:47:26,396
Me.

547
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:32,753
You okay, Freddie?

548
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:34,606
Yeah.

549
00:47:36,873 --> 00:47:37,689
Me too.

550
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:56,241
Harry talks this in sleep.

551
00:47:56,693 --> 00:47:57,432
You know it?

552
00:47:59,103 --> 00:48:00,735
No, of course, not!

553
00:48:46,588 --> 00:48:49,536
Yeah?
You-Know-Who's army?

554
00:49:08,914 --> 00:49:10,067
You do it.

555
00:49:10,335 --> 00:49:10,921
I can't.

556
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:11,718
Yes, you can!

557
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,124
Neville!

558
00:52:20,968 --> 00:52:22,053
That went well.

559
00:53:06,763 --> 00:53:08,030
Get inside!

560
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:29,435
<i>Stupefy</i>

561
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:36,608
Ginny, Neville!
You alright?

562
00:53:36,608 --> 00:53:37,530
Never better!

563
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:39,085
I feel like I can spit fire!

564
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:40,651
Have you seen Luna up there?

565
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:41,822
Luna?

566
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:45,663
I'm mad for her. I think it’s about time I told her
since we’ll probably both be dead by dawn.

567
00:53:50,657 --> 00:53:51,348
I know.

568
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,799
Bloody hell!
We'll never find him on this.

569
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,278
Here he is!

570
00:54:22,787 --> 00:54:24,410
- He's just...
- Brilliant!

571
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:25,140
He just vanished.

572
00:54:25,975 --> 00:54:27,031
I'm sure I saw it.

573
00:54:30,402 --> 00:54:32,178
Maybe he's gone to the Room of Requirement.

574
00:54:32,457 --> 00:54:33,657
It doesn't show up on the map, does it?

575
00:54:33,993 --> 00:54:34,858
You said that last year.

576
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,383
That's right, I did.

577
00:54:38,439 --> 00:54:39,208
Let's go.

578
00:54:40,802 --> 00:54:41,896
Brilliant!

579
00:54:48,225 --> 00:54:48,676
Come on!

580
00:56:36,504 --> 00:56:37,570
Well, well...

581
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:40,182
What brings you here, Potter?

582
00:56:41,574 --> 00:56:43,082
I could ask you the same.

583
00:56:43,793 --> 00:56:45,300
You have something of mine.

584
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:47,605
I'd like it back.

585
00:56:48,594 --> 00:56:49,708
What's wrong with the wand you have?

586
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:50,620
It's my mother's.

587
00:56:50,889 --> 00:56:52,666
It's powerful, but it's...

588
00:56:52,934 --> 00:56:53,760
..not the same.

589
00:56:54,788 --> 00:56:57,313
Doesn't quite understand me.

590
00:56:58,638 --> 00:56:59,579
You know what I mean?

591
00:57:00,223 --> 00:57:01,673
Why didn't you tell her?

592
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:04,755
Bellatrix?

593
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:09,653
You knew it was me.

594
00:57:10,843 --> 00:57:11,736
You didn't say anything.

595
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:13,561
Come on, Draco!

596
00:57:14,358 --> 00:57:15,453
Don't be a prat.

597
00:57:15,962 --> 00:57:16,989
Do it!

598
00:57:19,284 --> 00:57:19,659
Easy!

599
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:22,319
<i>Expelliarmus</i>

600
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,153
<i>Avada Kedavra</i>

601
00:57:24,162 --> 00:57:25,123
<i>Stupefy</i>

602
00:57:28,944 --> 00:57:30,971
This is my girlfriend,
you bloody gits!

603
00:57:52,173 --> 00:57:52,961
Got it!

604
00:58:07,605 --> 00:58:09,794
They've set the bloody place on fire!

605
00:59:15,217 --> 00:59:16,600
Come on!
This way!

606
00:59:24,215 --> 00:59:25,367
We can't leave them!

607
00:59:26,251 --> 00:59:27,240
He's joking, right?

608
00:59:36,766 --> 00:59:39,137
If we die for them,
Harry, I'm gonna kill you!

609
01:00:01,147 --> 01:00:01,713
Harry!

610
01:00:46,913 --> 01:00:47,672
My Lord?

611
01:00:48,382 --> 01:00:49,592
Avada Kedavra!

612
01:00:57,101 --> 01:01:01,087
Come Nagini, I need to keep you safe.

613
01:01:13,013 --> 01:01:13,580
It's the snake.

614
01:01:14,886 --> 01:01:15,827
She's the last one.

615
01:01:15,827 --> 01:01:17,690
It's the last Horcrux.

616
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:25,948
Look inside him, Harry.

617
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,365
Find out where he is,
if you find him, we can find the snake.

618
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,257
And we can end this!

619
01:01:59,164 --> 01:01:59,720
My Lord...

620
01:02:01,161 --> 01:02:04,359
Might it be less...

621
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:08,920
I should not be more prudent to call off this attack.

622
01:02:10,053 --> 01:02:11,839
Simply seek the boy.

623
01:02:12,137 --> 01:02:13,126
Yourself.

624
01:02:14,086 --> 01:02:16,804
I do not need to seek the boy...

625
01:02:17,274 --> 01:02:21,567
....before the night is out, he will come to me!
Do you understand?

626
01:02:23,084 --> 01:02:24,006
Look at me!

627
01:02:24,956 --> 01:02:28,500
How can you live with yourself, Lucius?

628
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:30,286
I don't know.

629
01:02:32,936 --> 01:02:34,732
Go and find Severus.

630
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:37,094
Bring him to me.

631
01:02:45,621 --> 01:02:46,620
I know where he is.

632
01:02:56,895 --> 01:02:57,605
Come on!

633
01:03:44,005 --> 01:03:45,302
No!

634
01:04:29,464 --> 01:04:32,950
You have performed extra-ordinary magic
with this wand, My Lord,

635
01:04:33,229 --> 01:04:35,361
in the last few hours alone.

636
01:04:35,361 --> 01:04:35,985
No!

637
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:44,224
No! I am extra-ordinary.
But the wand resists me.

638
01:04:44,704 --> 01:04:49,870
There is no wand more powerful.
Ollivander himself has said it.

639
01:04:50,542 --> 01:04:55,056
Tonight, when the boy comes.
It will not fail you, I am sure ...

640
01:04:57,159 --> 01:05:03,170
It answers to you,
and you only.

641
01:05:04,226 --> 01:05:05,062
Does it?

642
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:09,392
My Lord?

643
01:05:11,563 --> 01:05:15,461
The wand, does it truly
answer to me?

644
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:19,629
You're a clever man, Severus.

645
01:05:20,195 --> 01:05:21,194
Surely you must know...

646
01:05:23,499 --> 01:05:28,022
- Where does its true loyalty lie?
- With you...

647
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:31,382
Of course, My Lord.

648
01:05:31,709 --> 01:05:38,364
The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly,
because I am not its true master.

649
01:05:40,025 --> 01:05:44,577
The Elder Wand belongs to the
wizard who killed its last owner.

650
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:54,342
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.

651
01:05:56,263 --> 01:06:00,046
While you live, the Elder
Wand cannot truly be mine.

652
01:06:02,428 --> 01:06:06,922
You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus.

653
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:10,763
But only I can live forever.

654
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:15,651
My Lord...

655
01:06:21,556 --> 01:06:23,525
Nagini, kill!

656
01:07:22,034 --> 01:07:28,852
Take it...
Take it up, please!

657
01:07:29,889 --> 01:07:32,443
Give me something!
Quickly, a flask. Anything!

658
01:07:50,564 --> 01:07:52,215
Take them to the Pensieve.

659
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:56,152
Look at me...

660
01:08:02,644 --> 01:08:04,372
You really have your mother's eyes.

661
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:42,917
<i>You've fought valiantly,
but in vain...</i>

662
01:08:47,632 --> 01:08:54,489
<i>I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood
spilled is a terrible waste.</i>

663
01:08:55,554 --> 01:08:58,637
<i>I therefore command my forces to retreat...</i>

664
01:08:59,482 --> 01:09:04,648
<i>In their absence,
dispose your dead with dignity,</i>

665
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:10,698
<i>Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.</i>

666
01:09:11,284 --> 01:09:18,610
<i>On this night, you have allowed your friends to die
for you, rather than face me yourself.</i>

667
01:09:19,023 --> 01:09:25,169
<i>There is no greater dishonor.
Join me in the Forbidden Forrest...</i>

668
01:09:25,169 --> 01:09:27,301
<i>...and confront your fate.</i>

669
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:41,013
<i>If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man,
woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.</i>

670
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,448
Where's everybody?

671
01:10:27,586 --> 01:10:28,047
Harry?

672
01:10:33,684 --> 01:10:38,015
Oh, come on!
Don't be sad on it, she's passed.

673
01:10:39,743 --> 01:10:41,184
There, she's gone.

674
01:12:45,029 --> 01:12:50,321
<i>Freak! Come here! I'm gonna tell mommy!
You're freak!</i>

675
01:12:51,002 --> 01:12:52,769
<i>You're freak, Lily!</i>

676
01:12:52,769 --> 01:12:53,403
<i>Come here!</i>

677
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:19,129
<i>She's jealous.
She's ordinary and you're special.</i>

678
01:13:19,129 --> 01:13:20,146
<i>That's not true, Severus.</i>

679
01:13:42,943 --> 01:13:44,364
<i>Gryffindor!</i>

680
01:13:51,989 --> 01:13:54,140
<i>- Hi, I'm James.
- Hi, I'm Lily.</i>

681
01:13:59,421 --> 01:14:00,746
<i>Just like your father.</i>

682
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:05,241
<i>Don't say a word against my father!</i>

683
01:14:13,758 --> 01:14:17,349
<i>Masters shall be reunited once more!</i>

684
01:14:18,271 --> 01:14:18,944
<i>Severus.</i>

685
01:14:20,999 --> 01:14:21,872
<i>Don't kill me!</i>

686
01:14:23,034 --> 01:14:25,800
The prophecy did not refer to a woman.

687
01:14:26,751 --> 01:14:29,382
It spoke about a boy born at the end of the July.

688
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:31,139
Yes, but he thinks it's her son!

689
01:14:31,782 --> 01:14:34,337
He intends to hunt them down and kill them.

690
01:14:35,086 --> 01:14:38,965
Hide him... hide them all.
I beg you!

691
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,086
What would you give me in exchange, Severus?

692
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:46,129
- Anything.
- Harry...

693
01:14:46,129 --> 01:14:47,934
<i>Harry, you were so loved.</i>

694
01:14:48,328 --> 01:14:52,514
<i>So loved!
Harry, mama loves you.</i>

695
01:14:53,763 --> 01:14:55,174
Dadda loves you.

696
01:14:56,874 --> 01:14:58,775
Harry, be safe.

697
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:00,360
Be strong.

698
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,261
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

699
01:15:07,024 --> 01:15:10,731
You said you would keep her safe.

700
01:15:10,731 --> 01:15:12,008
Lily and James...

701
01:15:12,402 --> 01:15:14,812
put their faith in the wrong person, Severus.

702
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:16,569
Rather like you.

703
01:15:19,719 --> 01:15:21,082
The boy survives.

704
01:15:21,082 --> 01:15:23,435
He doesn't need protection,
the Dark Lord has gone.

705
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:25,020
The Dark Lord will return.

706
01:15:25,941 --> 01:15:28,121
And when he does, the boy
will be in terrible danger!

707
01:15:30,647 --> 01:15:31,828
He has her eyes.

708
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,137
If you truly loved her...

709
01:15:41,709 --> 01:15:45,348
No one, can know.

710
01:15:45,348 --> 01:15:48,306
<i>I shall never reveal the best of you,
Severus.</i>

711
01:15:48,306 --> 01:15:49,516
<i>Your word?</i>

712
01:15:49,516 --> 01:15:51,945
<i>Can you risk your life every day
to protect the boy?</i>

713
01:15:52,051 --> 01:15:57,707
<i>...He possesses no measurable talent, his arrogance rivals that of his father's and he seems to relish in his fame...</i>

714
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,532
<i>Don't tell a word against my father!</i>

715
01:16:00,799 --> 01:16:04,688
<i>James Potter, lazy, arrogant.</i>

716
01:16:04,688 --> 01:16:07,799
<i>- My father was a great man!
- Your father was a swine!</i>

717
01:16:09,749 --> 01:16:15,184
Drink it, it will contain the curse to
your hand, for the time being.

718
01:16:15,184 --> 01:16:18,141
- It will spread, Albus.
- How long?

719
01:16:19,928 --> 01:16:21,666
Maybe a year.

720
01:16:24,614 --> 01:16:25,881
Don't ignore me, Severus.

721
01:16:27,341 --> 01:16:31,105
We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered
the Malfoy boy to murder me.

722
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:38,701
But should he fail, I should presume
the Dark Lord will turn to you.

723
01:16:42,091 --> 01:16:44,520
You must be the one to kill me, Severus.

724
01:16:45,816 --> 01:16:47,420
It is the only way.

725
01:16:49,206 --> 01:16:53,057
Only then, will the Dark Lord trust you completely.

726
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:02,631
There will come a time, when Harry Potter,
must be told something.

727
01:17:05,147 --> 01:17:10,313
But you must wait, until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.

728
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:12,454
Must be told what?

729
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:17,476
On the night Lord Voldemort went
to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...

730
01:17:19,723 --> 01:17:21,951
Then, Lily Potter cast herself between them...

731
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,544
...the curse rebounded.

732
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:29,720
When that happens, a part of Voldemort's soul...

733
01:17:30,133 --> 01:17:33,945
latched itself onto the only living thing it could find...

734
01:17:34,704 --> 01:17:36,067
Harry himself.

735
01:17:38,247 --> 01:17:40,638
There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes...

736
01:17:41,954 --> 01:17:44,921
There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind...

737
01:17:46,957 --> 01:17:52,881
A part of Voldemort lives inside him.

738
01:17:58,557 --> 01:18:00,583
So, when the time comes...

739
01:18:02,426 --> 01:18:04,184
...the boy must die?

740
01:18:06,863 --> 01:18:10,118
Yes... yes.
He must die.

741
01:18:28,469 --> 01:18:32,224
You've kept him alive, so he can
die at the proper moment?

742
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:39,579
You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.

743
01:18:40,271 --> 01:18:43,507
Don't tell me now, that you've
grown to care for the boy.

744
01:18:48,903 --> 01:18:51,026
<i>Expecto Patronum</i>

745
01:19:02,376 --> 01:19:03,221
Lily!

746
01:19:07,225 --> 01:19:08,262
After all this time!

747
01:19:12,785 --> 01:19:13,649
Always.

748
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,293
So, when the time comes...

749
01:19:22,935 --> 01:19:24,395
...the boy must die?

750
01:19:25,499 --> 01:19:26,162
Yes.

751
01:19:27,564 --> 01:19:31,539
He must die.
And Voldemort himself must do it.

752
01:19:32,423 --> 01:19:33,623
That is essential.

753
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:38,892
- Where've you been?
- I thought you went to the forest.

754
01:20:39,238 --> 01:20:39,910
I'm going there now.

755
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,561
Are you mad?
No...

756
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:45,787
You can't give yourself up to him.

757
01:20:50,003 --> 01:20:50,982
What is it, Harry?

758
01:20:52,768 --> 01:20:54,487
What is it you know?

759
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,404
There is a reason I can hear them.

760
01:21:00,892 --> 01:21:01,987
The Horcruxes.

761
01:21:04,637 --> 01:21:05,953
I think I've known for a while.

762
01:21:08,132 --> 01:21:09,342
And I think you have, too.

763
01:21:13,107 --> 01:21:15,354
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.

764
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:18,551
Kill the snake, and it's just him!

765
01:22:35,987 --> 01:22:36,852
I'm ready to die.

766
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:19,142
Resurrection Stone.

767
01:23:48,411 --> 01:23:50,274
You've been so brave, sweetheart.

768
01:23:55,814 --> 01:23:58,705
Why are you here?
All of you.

769
01:24:02,133 --> 01:24:03,285
We never left.

770
01:24:12,792 --> 01:24:13,550
Does...

771
01:24:14,914 --> 01:24:16,191
Does it hurt?

772
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:18,064
Dying?

773
01:24:19,408 --> 01:24:20,944
Quicker than falling asleep.

774
01:24:25,343 --> 01:24:26,937
You're nearly there, son.

775
01:24:28,367 --> 01:24:29,356
I'm sorry.

776
01:24:29,654 --> 01:24:31,968
I never wanted any of you to die for me.

777
01:24:34,398 --> 01:24:36,030
And, Remus, your son?

778
01:24:36,261 --> 01:24:38,949
Others will tell him what his
mother and father died for.

779
01:24:40,303 --> 01:24:42,829
One day, he'll understand.

780
01:24:54,948 --> 01:24:56,234
You'll stay with me?

781
01:24:58,068 --> 01:24:59,038
Until the end.

782
01:25:00,661 --> 01:25:02,246
And he won't be able to see you?

783
01:25:02,947 --> 01:25:03,878
No.

784
01:25:05,655 --> 01:25:07,047
We're here, you see.

785
01:25:21,989 --> 01:25:23,179
Stay close to me.

786
01:25:26,147 --> 01:25:26,886
Always.

787
01:25:41,972 --> 01:25:44,641
No sign of him, My Lord.

788
01:26:00,582 --> 01:26:01,840
I thought he'd come.

789
01:26:42,526 --> 01:26:44,063
Harry, no!

790
01:26:44,428 --> 01:26:46,550
- What're yeh doin' here?
- Quiet!

791
01:26:57,526 --> 01:26:58,956
Harry Potter...

792
01:27:02,836 --> 01:27:04,497
...The Boy Who Lived...

793
01:27:09,779 --> 01:27:11,123
...come to die.

794
01:27:29,349 --> 01:27:31,202
<i>Avada Kedavra</i>

795
01:28:25,102 --> 01:28:26,273
You can't help...

796
01:28:27,714 --> 01:28:30,460
Harry, you're a wonderful boy...

797
01:28:31,805 --> 01:28:35,002
You brave, brave man!

798
01:28:37,528 --> 01:28:38,421
Let us walk.

799
01:28:46,391 --> 01:28:47,620
Professor, what is that?

800
01:28:51,077 --> 01:28:52,978
Something beyond either of our help.

801
01:28:56,916 --> 01:28:59,057
A part of Voldemort sent here to die.

802
01:29:00,421 --> 01:29:01,669
And exactly where are we?

803
01:29:02,783 --> 01:29:04,300
I was gonna ask you that.

804
01:29:05,078 --> 01:29:06,288
Where would you say where we are?

805
01:29:06,787 --> 01:29:10,004
Well, it looks like King's Cross station.

806
01:29:11,214 --> 01:29:13,019
Only cleaner...

807
01:29:13,855 --> 01:29:15,228
....and without all the trains.

808
01:29:16,323 --> 01:29:18,166
King's Cross, is that right?

809
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:21,969
This is as they say, 'your' party.

810
01:29:23,889 --> 01:29:26,165
I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort...

811
01:29:26,857 --> 01:29:29,181
...have been connected by something other than fate.

812
01:29:30,006 --> 01:29:32,638
Since that night at Godric's Hollow all those years ago.

813
01:29:33,022 --> 01:29:34,203
So it's true then, sir.

814
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:36,738
A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?

815
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:38,543
Did.

816
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:42,836
It's been just destroyed many moments
ago by none other than Voldemort himself.

817
01:29:44,766 --> 01:29:48,319
You, were the Horcrux he
never meant to make, Harry.

818
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:04,739
- I have to go back, haven't I?
- Oh, that's up to you.

819
01:30:04,989 --> 01:30:07,150
- I've a choice?
- Oh, yes!

820
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:10,434
We're in King's Cross, you say.

821
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:16,618
I think if you so decide,
you'll be able to board a train.

822
01:30:18,394 --> 01:30:19,691
And where will it take me?

823
01:30:20,853 --> 01:30:21,707
On.

824
01:30:40,087 --> 01:30:41,700
Voldemort has the Elder Wand?

825
01:30:44,782 --> 01:30:45,637
True.

826
01:30:45,637 --> 01:30:46,924
And the snake is still alive?

827
01:30:47,462 --> 01:30:48,095
Yes.

828
01:30:49,008 --> 01:30:50,275
And I've nothing to kill it with?

829
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:54,145
Help will always be given at Hogwarts, Harry.

830
01:30:54,145 --> 01:30:55,441
To those who ask for it.

831
01:30:57,314 --> 01:31:00,723
I've always pride of myself
on my ability to turn a phrase.

832
01:31:01,971 --> 01:31:04,314
Words are, in my not so humble opinion...

833
01:31:04,977 --> 01:31:07,714
..almost inexhaustible source of magic.

834
01:31:08,952 --> 01:31:12,611
Capable of inflicting
injury and remedies.

835
01:31:13,283 --> 01:31:14,839
But I would in this case...

836
01:31:15,665 --> 01:31:18,344
amend my original statement to this:

837
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:24,701
Help, will always be given at Hogwarts,

838
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:26,900
To those who deserve it.

839
01:31:33,266 --> 01:31:35,100
Do not pity the dead, Harry...

840
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:37,578
Pity the living.

841
01:31:38,749 --> 01:31:39,854
And above all...

842
01:31:40,219 --> 01:31:42,331
....all those who live without love.

843
01:31:44,434 --> 01:31:46,211
Professor, my mother's Patronus...

844
01:31:47,229 --> 01:31:49,082
was a doe, wasn't it?

845
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:52,385
As the same as Professor Snape's.

846
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:55,986
It's curious, don't you think?

847
01:31:55,996 --> 01:31:57,887
Actually, if I think about it...

848
01:31:58,387 --> 01:32:00,038
...it doesn't seem curious at all!

849
01:32:02,554 --> 01:32:03,937
I'll be going now, Harry.

850
01:32:04,897 --> 01:32:06,069
Professor?

851
01:32:10,832 --> 01:32:12,147
Is this all real?

852
01:32:13,645 --> 01:32:15,249
Or is it just happening inside my head?

853
01:32:15,249 --> 01:32:17,909
Of course it's happening
inside your head, Harry.

854
01:32:19,119 --> 01:32:21,856
Why should that mean, that it's not real?

855
01:32:27,627 --> 01:32:28,789
Professor?

856
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:30,815
What should I do?

857
01:32:34,896 --> 01:32:36,116
Professor!

858
01:32:40,168 --> 01:32:41,925
My Lord, My Lord...

859
01:32:42,204 --> 01:32:42,924
Are you hurt?

860
01:32:43,654 --> 01:32:45,209
I don't need your help.

861
01:32:56,108 --> 01:32:57,318
The boy...

862
01:32:58,125 --> 01:32:59,249
Is he dead?

863
01:33:13,499 --> 01:33:14,824
Is he alive?

864
01:33:15,708 --> 01:33:17,225
Draco, is he alive?

865
01:33:43,171 --> 01:33:44,189
Dead.

866
01:35:08,376 --> 01:35:09,538
Who is that?

867
01:35:09,806 --> 01:35:10,805
Hagrid's carrying?

868
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:12,947
Neville, who is it?

869
01:35:14,118 --> 01:35:15,626
Harry Potter...

870
01:35:17,489 --> 01:35:19,611
...is dead!
- No!

871
01:35:19,611 --> 01:35:20,350
No!

872
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:21,118
Silence!

873
01:35:25,853 --> 01:35:27,408
Stupid girl!

874
01:35:28,829 --> 01:35:30,106
Harry Potter...

875
01:35:30,106 --> 01:35:31,489
is dead!

876
01:35:32,229 --> 01:35:33,611
From this day forth...

877
01:35:35,013 --> 01:35:38,259
...you'll put your faith in me.

878
01:35:48,390 --> 01:35:50,176
Harry Potter is dead!

879
01:35:55,189 --> 01:35:57,551
And now it's the time to declare yourself.

880
01:35:59,788 --> 01:36:01,930
Come forward and join us...

881
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:05,425
or die!

882
01:36:11,715 --> 01:36:13,030
Draco!

883
01:36:18,168 --> 01:36:19,042
Draco.

884
01:36:22,383 --> 01:36:23,757
Draco.

885
01:36:26,858 --> 01:36:28,164
Come.

886
01:36:40,888 --> 01:36:42,491
Well done, Draco.

887
01:36:43,759 --> 01:36:44,671
Well done!

888
01:37:07,017 --> 01:37:09,312
Well, I must say I'd hope for better.

889
01:37:13,662 --> 01:37:15,669
And who might you be, young man?

890
01:37:17,522 --> 01:37:19,414
Neville Longbottom.

891
01:37:24,647 --> 01:37:28,690
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
find a place for you in our rank.

892
01:37:28,815 --> 01:37:29,871
I'd like to say something.

893
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:41,087
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be
fascinated to hear what you have to say.

894
01:37:45,005 --> 01:37:47,213
- Doesn't matter that Harry is gone.
- Stand down, Neville!

895
01:37:47,223 --> 01:37:48,481
People die everyday!

896
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:54,636
Friends, family.

897
01:37:57,536 --> 01:37:58,016
Yeah...

898
01:38:00,369 --> 01:38:01,694
We lost Harry tonight.

899
01:38:03,951 --> 01:38:05,007
He's still with us.

900
01:38:06,448 --> 01:38:07,369
In here.

901
01:38:09,261 --> 01:38:13,611
So as Fred, Remus...

902
01:38:14,811 --> 01:38:15,925
Tonks...

903
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:18,451
All of them.

904
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,601
They didn't die in vain.

905
01:38:27,381 --> 01:38:28,591
But you will.

906
01:38:28,966 --> 01:38:29,984
Because you're wrong!

907
01:38:30,877 --> 01:38:32,413
Harry's heart did beat for us.

908
01:38:33,047 --> 01:38:34,094
For all of us!

909
01:38:34,545 --> 01:38:35,726
It's not over!

910
01:38:39,961 --> 01:38:40,873
<i>Confringo</i>

911
01:38:52,704 --> 01:38:54,557
Come on!

912
01:39:01,634 --> 01:39:02,930
All remain into the castle.

913
01:39:03,334 --> 01:39:04,217
We have to kill the snake.

914
01:39:04,217 --> 01:39:05,466
Hey, Neville!

915
01:41:53,474 --> 01:41:55,442
Not my daughter, you bitch!

916
01:42:27,775 --> 01:42:29,013
Hey, you were right...

917
01:42:30,838 --> 01:42:33,287
...when you told Professor Snape
that wand was failing you.

918
01:42:33,287 --> 01:42:34,285
It was always fail...

919
01:42:36,379 --> 01:42:37,877
I killed Snape!

920
01:42:37,877 --> 01:42:39,240
Yeah, but what if the wand never belonged to Snape?

921
01:42:39,951 --> 01:42:41,939
What if its allegiance has always been
with someone else?

922
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:43,917
Oh, come on, Tom...

923
01:42:43,917 --> 01:42:45,655
Let's finish this the way we started.

924
01:42:46,596 --> 01:42:47,796
Together!

925
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:45,863
Die!

926
01:46:24,346 --> 01:46:25,412
Harry!

927
01:47:23,662 --> 01:47:24,641
Why didn't it work for him?

928
01:47:25,304 --> 01:47:25,909
The Elder Wand?

929
01:47:27,954 --> 01:47:29,481
It answers to somebody else.

930
01:47:30,643 --> 01:47:33,418
When he killed Snape, he thought
the wand would become his.

931
01:47:33,716 --> 01:47:34,378
But the thing is...

932
01:47:35,607 --> 01:47:36,721
The wand never belongs to Snape.

933
01:47:37,653 --> 01:47:41,187
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the Astronomy tower.

934
01:47:42,147 --> 01:47:45,239
From that moment on, the wand answered him.

935
01:47:46,929 --> 01:47:51,077
Until, the other night when I disarmed Draco.

936
01:47:51,615 --> 01:47:52,883
At Malfoy Manor.

937
01:47:53,401 --> 01:47:54,553
So, that means...

938
01:47:57,050 --> 01:47:57,742
It's mine!

939
01:48:00,517 --> 01:48:03,484
- What should we do with it?
- We?

940
01:48:04,367 --> 01:48:05,702
Just saying, that's the Elder Wand.

941
01:48:06,374 --> 01:48:07,863
The most powerful wand in the world.

942
01:48:08,756 --> 01:48:11,521
With that, he'll be invincible.

943
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:30,597
Together.

944
01:51:08,182 --> 01:51:09,929
- Bag?
- Yeah

945
01:51:10,467 --> 01:51:11,255
Jumper?

946
01:51:13,069 --> 01:51:14,299
I'm gonna miss you.

947
01:51:15,528 --> 01:51:16,718
Here they come.

948
01:51:32,063 --> 01:51:33,033
Dad?

949
01:51:33,658 --> 01:51:35,482
What if I am put in Slytherin?

950
01:51:38,123 --> 01:51:44,557
Albus Severus Potter.
You're named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts.

951
01:51:45,747 --> 01:51:50,020
One of them was a Slytherin.
And he was the bravest man I've ever known.

952
01:51:52,268 --> 01:51:55,168
- What you say if I am...
- Then Slytherin house...

953
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:58,231
will've gained a wonderful young wizard.

954
01:51:59,537 --> 01:52:00,871
Listen...

955
01:52:01,073 --> 01:52:04,232
If it really means that much to you,
you can choose Gryffindor.

956
01:52:04,232 --> 01:52:07,315
The Sorting Hat takes
your choice into account.

957
01:52:08,198 --> 01:52:10,330
- Really?
- Really.

958
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:15,832
- Ready?
- Ready.

959
01:52:16,305 --> 01:52:22,201
