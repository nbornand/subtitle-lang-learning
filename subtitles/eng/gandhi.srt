they told them to
give the finger prints.

92
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:34,362
and you know Why? because the color
of his face and body is not white

93
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,468
lf your color is like this

94
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:41,808
or like this

95
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,210

Mr. Satya Pal l can`t let
go any Godrej customer.

376
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:04,254
- because of the product shortage.

377
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:06,324
Mr. Hari this is enough.

378
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:08,725
Why do you worry so much? Mr. Satya Pal

379
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:12,929
You are our special customer.

01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:06,987

lf you`ll call me l`ll
come with them once more.

396
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,271
Are those south Africa pictures?

397
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,743
Hari you have very nice books.

398
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:36,846
l tried to learn on my
own as much as l could.

399
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:42,955
Mahadev remember l told you.

400
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:46,626
My HariLal was the first revolutionist

401
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,690
who used a pen as a weapon

402
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:50,330
for the rights of lndians.

403
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:55,698
You were my brave soldier.

404
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:59,272
they`re old memories.
lt`s been a long time.

405
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:07,271
Mahadev!

406
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:12,182
Bapu this is calcutta. these
people won`t understand.

407
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:13,747
You`ll have to speak.

408
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,165
l am my son`s guest.

409
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:31,570
today l am here to spend
the night at his home.

410
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:35,035
Can you please let me spend
sometime with him in peace.

411
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:37,236
whole crowd: Yes

412
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:39,944
Long Live. Mahatma Gandhi

413
01:18:58,533 --> 01:19:00,501
Hari. History is calling you again.

414
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:05,469
Come join us in our revolution.

415
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:09,604
to do what?

416
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:13,042
Fight for our country.

417
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:18,219
You have your whole
life to fight with me.

418
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:26,058
But it`s probably the last
chance to fight for the country.

419
01:19:43,678 --> 01:19:44,838
Go tell the English government.

420
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:48,749
Hang us.

421
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:50,877
Put us in the jail.

422
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:56,682
But they`ll only get hatred
from our side. Nothing else.

423
01:19:58,193 --> 01:20:01,720
this British government
is the Devil`s Government.

424
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:07,658
People who love God. How
can they be with the Devil?

425
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:08,861
Can they?

426
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:38,798
British government has
been doing horrible things.

427
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:42,435
And if they won`t apologize
to God and to this country.

428
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:43,571
then it`ll be destroyed.

429
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,034
And l also want to say this...

430
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:48,202
lf they don`t apologize

431
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,572
lt is our duty. that we
lndians should destroy it.

432
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,189
We are great full that you are with us.

433
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:40,952
We were thinking who
else besides Gandhi.

434
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:42,586
lt is great that you are here.

435
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:47,694
l thank you. l didn`t even
- have any other place to live.

436
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:49,064
Leave all that.

437
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:53,363
We paid the balance
rent to your landlord.

438
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:56,142
Now you sleep peacefully in your house.

439
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:58,170
thank you so much.

440
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:01,011
Mr. Hari l want to give
- you an advise.

441
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,316
think about you children.

442
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:07,883
Children`s responsibility is important
same as the fighting for wisdom.

443
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:11,449
l know. but what can i do?

444
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,093
Either l am in the Jail
or rallying on the streets.

445
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:17,692
you are right. You need us.

446
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:19,991
that is why l`ve called this meeting.

447
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:24,529
For your help we`ve created an
organization of repected people.

448
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:26,807
We will run a
- company under your name.

449
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:29,272
We`ll make factory.
We`ll market it`s shares.

450
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:31,669
We`ll gather money, earn profit.

451
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:34,181
Meaning we`ll secure your future.

452
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:38,212
But who`ll buy
- shares of my company?

453
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,582
neither any one in my
family is in bussiness.

454
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:43,254
Neither l am a bussiness son.

455
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:47,092
Nothing is bigger than Gandhi
- in this country.

456
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:51,361
You can`t use my Father`s name.

457
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:55,264
Leave him. He`s not able
to make you understand.

458
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:57,628
We`ll only use your name.

459
01:22:58,073 --> 01:22:59,973
Hari Lal Mohandas Gandhi.

460
01:23:00,408 --> 01:23:02,137
Look your making all this confusing.

461
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:04,402
Mr. Hari l`ll explain to you.

462
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:06,311
lt`s straight and subtle.

463
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:09,713
You people who fight for wisdom
- are very emotional.

464
01:23:10,051 --> 01:23:11,916
But real world is very confusing.

465
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:13,916
But the timing is perfect.

466
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:16,156
People call you Gandhi.

467
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:18,692
Only use this name.

468
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:21,725
Now you don`t need to ask
- your father for anything.

469
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:24,528
But l`ve never done such thing.

470
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:29,536
You just leave everything to me.
l`ll make everything allright.

471
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,808
Whenever you feel there
is something wrong.

472
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:36,237
You can leave all this.

473
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:42,746
No thank you. l quit all this.

474
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:46,920
Mr. Hari you have this
life to live it the fullest.

475
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:49,789
l know you have a name
- in the society.

476
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,593
But who`s watching here. Cheers.

477
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:55,820
lt`ll be our pleasure.

478
01:24:14,015 --> 01:24:16,381
Have you found out anything
- about his relatives.

479
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:17,082
No.

480
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:52,145
l`ve put all my life savings in
- Hari Brother`s company.

481
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:59,926
Now there is no company
- nor Hari Brother.

482
01:25:02,897 --> 01:25:04,626
they`re all gone.

483
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:12,503
they showed me your picture.

484
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:17,307
thats why i gave them all
- the money.

485
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:27,946
At that time you were everything
- for me.

486
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:32,588
Now l am destroyed.

487
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:37,858
Where should l go?

488
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:42,001
What should l do Bapu?

489
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:58,883
Harilal is my eldest son, But
we have had our differences.

490
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:04,415
He doesn`t believe in my methods.
and He shows that in public.

491
01:26:05,593 --> 01:26:10,530
lf he changes his mind.
l will welcome him back.

492
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:15,068
Everyone has a limit and dignity.

493
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:18,504
lf Harilal has any dignity left,

494
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:20,499
He`ll pay back to people.

495
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:26,342
lt is a warning to those people
who do bussiness over big names.

496
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:31,349
lt`s not necessery that
- good people have good children.

497
01:26:32,053 --> 01:26:34,715
Next time whenever
- you do bussiness with him.

498
01:26:35,456 --> 01:26:37,219
Please do remember,

499
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:41,087
that l don`t have
- any kind of relation with him.

500
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:43,659
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

501
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:52,568
You all should work open hearted
- to end racism.

502
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:57,972
Will you repeat with me
- some lines of Kanhaiya Lal Dixit.

503
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:02,379
temple, Mosque and Church.

504
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:07,555
Only this should be the religion.

505
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:10,624
one for all of us.

506
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:13,118
Vande Matram

507
01:27:25,106 --> 01:27:27,904
Long Live Mahatma Gandhi.

508
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:36,645
We won`t let any low race in
our temples. till the end of us.

509
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:43,383
Hindu Society will never tolarate this.

510
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:03,433
Mr. Gandhi tell us
- clearly about your issue of racism.

511
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,838
Racism is a bad
- thing in human society.

512
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,014
Until racism is present
in hindu society.

513
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:10,117
We can never become a
part of the real world.

514
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,123
Hari!

515
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:30,895
How much are people taking part in
your collectings of racism donation.

516
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:34,234
Look l`m travling in the whole
- country with a bowl.

517
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:38,074
But sadly l think heart
- of city people have become smaller.

518
01:28:39,247 --> 01:28:42,944
lf you ask them for money
- for the good of society and country.

519
01:28:43,084 --> 01:28:44,551
they make new excuses for that.

520
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:46,984
And on otherside our Village People.

521
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:50,152
Even after having less of it.
they`re ready to give all of it.

522
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:54,957
Now l believe
- that lndia have it`s day in it`s Village.

523
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:01,100
l`m feeding you.

524
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:06,506
No matter how old you are.
You`ll always be child for me.

525
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:12,507
Where were you Hari
- for so many days?

526
01:29:14,615 --> 01:29:16,606
We looked every where for you.

527
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:20,914
Look. l want to say one thing clearly.

528
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:24,753
Racism should be ripped from the root.

529
