1
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,480
I owe everything to George
Bailey... Help him, dear Father.

2
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,320
Joseph, Jesus and Mary.
Help my friend, Mr. Bailey.

3
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,840
Help my son, George, tonight.

4
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,600
He never thinks about himself,
God, that's why he's in trouble.

5
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,840
George is a good guy.
Give him a break, God...

6
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,800
I love him, dear Lord.
Watch over him tonight...

7
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,760
Please, God, something's
the matter with Daddy...

8
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,320
Please bring Daddy back.

9
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,000
Hello, Joseph. Trouble?

10
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,720
Looks like we'll have
to send someone down.

11
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,440
A lot of people asking for help
for a man named George Bailey.

12
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,840
George Bailey. Yes. Tonight's
his crucial night. You're right.

13
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,200
We'll have to send someone down
immediately. Whose turn is it?

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,720
That's why I came to see you, sir.

15
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,120
It's that clock-maker's turn again.

16
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,480
Oh, Clarence. Hasn't got
his wings yet, has he?

17
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,600
We've passed him up right along.

18
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,920
Because, you know, sir, he's
got the I.Q. Of a rabbit.

19
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,640
Yes, but he's got the
faith of a child. Simple.

20
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,800
Joseph, send for Clarence.

21
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
You sent for me, sir?

22
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,520
Yes, Clarence. A man down
on earth needs our help.

23
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,960
Splendid! Is he sick?

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,280
No. Worse. He's discouraged.

25
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,200
At exactly ten forty-five
P.M., earth-time,

26
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,080
that man will be thinking seriously
of throwing away God's greatest gift.

27
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,160
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then
I have only an hour to dress.

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,120
What are they wearing now?

29
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,480
You will spend that hour getting
acquainted with George Bailey.

30
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,040
Sir, lf I should accomplish this mission,
I mean, might I perhaps win my wings?

31
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,560
I've been waiting for over
two hundred years now, sir...

32
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,120
and people are beginniing to talk.

33
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,120
What's that book you've got there?

34
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,040
Oh, 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'

35
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,640
Clarence, you do a good job with
George Bailey and you'll get your wings.

36
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,720
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

37
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,880
Poor George. Sit down.

38
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,880
Sit down?! What are we...

39
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,000
If you're going to help a man, you want
to know something about him, don't you?

40
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,800
- Well, naturally, of course, I...
- Well, keep your eyes open.

41
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,640
- See the town?
- Where? I... I don't see a thing.

42
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Oh, I forgot. You haven't
got your wings yet.

43
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,640
Now look, I'll help you out.

44
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,400
Concentrate.

45
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,720
Begin to see something?

46
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,880
Why, yes! This is amazing!

47
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,560
If you ever get your wings,
you'll see all by yourself.

48
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,400
Oh, wonderful!

49
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,280
Yippee!

50
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,880
Okay, boys, let's go.

51
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
Hey, who's that?

52
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,880
- That's your problem, George Bailey.
- A boy?!

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,280
That's him when he was twelve.
Back in nineteen nineteen.

54
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,600
Something happens here you'll
have to remember later on.

55
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,520
Come on, Marty. Come on, Marty.

56
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,600
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw!

57
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,000
And here comes the scare-baby,
my kid brother, Harry Bailey!

58
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
I'm not scared!

59
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,040
Go, Harry! C'mon, Harry!
Attaboy, Harry! Come on, Harry!

60
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,400
Help, George! Help! Help!

61
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,120
...Harry, I'm coming!

62
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,600
- Help!
- Hang on, Harry!

63
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm coming! Chain Gang!

64
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,120
George saved his
brother's life that day.

65
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,800
But it caught him that cold
which infected his left ear.

66
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,160
Cost him his hearing in that ear.

67
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,880
It was weeks before he was able
to go back to his after-school job

68
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,640
at old man Gower's Drugstore.

69
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,000
Mr. Potter!

70
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,240
Who's that? A king?

71
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,360
That's Henry F. Potter.

72
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,920
The richest and meanest
man in the county.

73
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,080
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
Go to work, slave...

74
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,360
I wish I had a million
dollars! Hot dog!

75
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,760
It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.

76
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,920
- You're late
- Yes, sir.

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,960
Hello, George. Hello, Mary.

78
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,200
Hello, Violet.

79
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,760
Two-cents' worth of shoelaces?

80
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,480
She was here first.

81
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,200
I'm still thinking.

82
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,160
Shoelaces?

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,840
Please, Georgie. I like him.

84
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,720
You like every boy.

85
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,560
What's wrong with that?

86
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,720
Here you are.

87
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,480
- Help me down.
- Help you down?!

88
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,360
Made up your mind yet?

89
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,160
I'll take chocolate.

90
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,360
With coconuts?

91
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,280
I don't like coconuts.

92
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,120
You don't like coconuts?

93
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,560
Say, brainless, don't you
know where coconuts come from?

94
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,960
Look it here... from Tahiti,
Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,080
A new magazine! I never saw it before.

96
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,320
Of course you never.

97
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
Only us explorers can get it.

98
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,480
I've been nominated for membership
in the National Geographic Society.

99
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,280
Is this the ear you can't hear on?

100
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,520
George Bailey, I'll love
you till the day I die.

101
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,680
I'm going out exploring
some day, you watch.

102
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,280
And I'm gonna have a couple of
harems, and maybe three or four wives.

103
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,640
Wait and see.

104
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,480
- George! George!
- Yes, sir.

105
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,640
You're not paid to be a canary.

106
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,000
No, sir...

107
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,360
Mr. Gower, do you want something?

108
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,880
- Anything?
- No.

109
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,200
- Anything I can do back here?
- Nope.

110
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,560
I'll get them, sir.

111
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,960
...take those capsules
over to Mrs. Blaine's.

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,080
- She's waiting for them.
- Yes, sir...

113
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,280
They have the diphtheria
there, haven't they, sir?

114
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,400
Ummm.

115
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,280
Is it a charge, sir?

116
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Yes, charge.

117
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,920
- Mr. Gower, I think...
- Aw, get going!

118
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,120
Yes, sir.

119
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,560
Fast there, Captain
Cook! Where you headin'?

120
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,800
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.

121
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,800
- Some other time, George.
- It's important!

122
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,560
There's a squall in there
that's shapin' up into a storm.

123
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,880
Uncle Billy, telephone.

124
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,040
- Who is it?
- The Bank examiner.

125
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,520
Bank examiner?

126
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,760
Oh, I should have
called him yesterday.

127
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,320
Switch it inside.

128
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,760
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

129
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,680
Well, you're begging and
that's a whole lot worse.

130
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,760
All I'm asking for
is thirty days more.

131
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
- Pop!
- Just a minute, son.

132
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,720
Just thirty short days. I'll dig
up that five thousand somehow.

133
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,360
- Shove me up. Shove me up.
- Pop!

134
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,640
Have you put any real pressure on these
people of yours to pay those mortgages?

135
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,080
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot
of these people are out of work.

136
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,800
- Then foreclose!
- I can't do that.

137
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,440
- These families have children.
- Pop!

138
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,600
They're not my children.

139
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,920
But they're somebody's
children, Mr. Potter.

140
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,200
Are you running a
business or a charity ward?

141
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,400
- Well, all right...
- Not with my money.

142
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,080
Mr. Potter, what makes you
such a hard-skulled character?

143
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,920
You have no family, no children.

144
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,880
You can't begin to spend
all the money you've got.

145
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,800
So I suppose I should give it
to miserable failures like you

146
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,520
and that idiot brother
of yours to spend for me.

147
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,880
He's not a failure!

148
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,240
- You can't say that about my father!
- George, George, quiet. George...

149
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,000
You're not! You're the
biggest man in town!

150
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,120
- Run along.
- Bigger than him.

151
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,520
- Run along!
- Bigger than everybody!

152
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,960
Gives you an idea of the Baileys.

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,880
Don't let him say things
like that about you, Pop.

154
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,880
All right, son. All right.

155
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,080
Thanks. I'll talk to you tonight.

156
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,960
What!

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,720
Why, that medicine should
have been there an hour ago.

158
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,520
It'll be over in five
minutes, Mrs. Blaine.

159
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,520
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?

160
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,320
I feel...

161
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,360
- Didn't you hear what I said?
- Yes, sir, I...

162
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,800
What kind of tricks
are you playing anyway?

163
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,960
Why didn't you deliver
them right away?

164
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,320
Don't you know that boy's very sick?

165
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,000
You're hurting my sore ear.

166
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,520
You lazy loafer!

167
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,640
Mr. Gower, you don't
know what you're doing.

168
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,680
You put something
wrong in those capsules.

169
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,040
I know you're unhappy.

170
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,880
You got that telegram
and you're upset.

171
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,680
You put something
bad in those capsules.

172
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,560
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.

173
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,880
Just look and see what you did.

174
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,440
Look at the bottle you
took the powder from.

175
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,200
It's poison! I tell you it's poison!

176
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,720
I know you feel bad.

177
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,200
I didn't know...

178
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,920
- Oh...
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,320
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Oh, no, no, no...

180
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,320
Oh, George. George...

181
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,120
Oh, Mr. Gower, I
won't ever tell anyone.

182
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,600
I know what you're feeling.

183
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,040
I won't tell a soul.

184
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,280
- Hope to die, I won't.
- Oh, George, George...

185
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,040
An overnight bag,
genuine English cowhide,

186
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,280
combination lock, fitted
up with brushes, combs...

187
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,840
Nope! Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

188
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,480
Now look, Joe. Now look,

189
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,440
I, l-I want a big one.

190
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,280
What did you stop it for?

191
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,760
I want you to take a
good look at that face.

192
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,760
- Who is it?
- George Bailey.

193
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,080
Oh, you mean the kid that had his
ears slapped back by the druggist?

194
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,680
That's the kid.

195
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,400
Uh-huh. It's a good face.

196
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,920
I like it. I like George Bailey.

197
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,480
Tell me, did he ever tell
anyone about the pills?

198
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,920
Not a soul.

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,800
Did he ever marry the girl?
Did he ever go exploring?

200
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,280
Well, wait and see.

201
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,440
Big... see... I, I don't
want one for one night.

202
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,520
I want something for a
thousand and one nights.

203
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,120
With plenty of room here for labels
from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand...

204
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,240
a great big one.

205
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,200
- I see, a flying carpet, huh?
- Yeah.

206
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,080
I don't suppose you'd like this
old second-hand job, would you?

207
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,320
Now you're talking.

208
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,320
Gee whiz, I could use that as
a raft in case the boat sunk.

209
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,240
- How much does this cost?
- No charge.

210
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,600
That's my trick ear, Joe. It
sounded as if you said no charge.

211
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
That's right.

212
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,360
Well, what's my name doing on it here?

213
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,240
A little present form old man Gower.
Came down and picked it out himself.

214
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,200
He did?!

215
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,200
What do you know about that...
my old boss. Isn't that nice?

216
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,200
What boat you sailing on?

217
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
I'm working across on a cattle boat.

218
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,240
- A cattle boat?
- Okay, I like cows.

219
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,080
- Hello, Mr. Gower.
- George!

220
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,760
How are you? Thanks ever
so much for the baggage.

221
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,360
- It's just exactly what I wanted.
- Aw, forget it.

222
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,160
Oh, it's wonderful
of you to think of it.

223
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,760
- Hope you enjoy it.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

224
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,240
I wish I had a million
dollars. Hot dog!

225
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,160
Avast there, Captain Cook!
You got your sealegs yet?

226
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,600
Parlez vous Francais, Mister?

227
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,640
Hey, send us some of their picture
postcards, will you, George?

228
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,520
Hey, George, don't take
any plugged nickels.

229
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,560
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.

230
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,920
Hey, Ernie! Hi, Ernie!

231
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
- Hiya, George.
- Hi, Bert.

232
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,040
- George...
- Hey, hey, I, I'm a rich tourist today.

233
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,760
- How about driving me home in style?
- Great.

234
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,120
Hop in Your Highness, hop in.
And for the carriage trade.

235
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,720
I put on my hat.

236
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,880
- Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
- Hello, Violet.

237
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,080
Hey, you look good. That's
some dress you got on there.

238
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,720
What! This old thing?

239
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,080
Why, I only wear it when
I don't care how I look.

240
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,440
- How would you like...
- Yes.

241
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,080
Want to come along, Bert?
We'll show you the town.

242
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,360
No, thanks. I, uh, I've gotta go
home and see what the wife's doing.

243
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,720
Family man.

244
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,840
George! Harry!

245
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,160
You're shaking the
house down! Stop it!

246
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,160
Oh, let them alone! I wish
I was up there with them.

247
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,640
But Harry'll tear his
dinner suit! George!

248
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,080
That's why all children
should be girls.

249
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,400
But if they were all girls,
there wouldn't be any...

250
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,920
Oh, never mind.

251
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,400
George! Harry! Come down
to dinner this minute.

252
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,400
Everything's getting cold and you know,
how long we've been waiting for you.

253
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,160
Okay, Mom!

254
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:51,480
- Here's a present for you, Pop.
- Oh, you two idiots!

255
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,480
- George, sit down and have dinner.
- I've eaten.

256
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, aren't you going to finish
dressing for your graduating party?

257
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,120
- Look at you!
- I don't care.

258
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,840
It's George's tux. Annie, my
sweet, have you got those pies?

259
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,280
If you lay a hand on me,
I'll hit you with this broom.

260
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,680
Annie, I'm in love with you,
there's a moon out tonight.

261
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,520
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, my last meal
in the old Bailey Boarding House.

262
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,680
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure!

263
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,080
Pop, can I have the car? I have to
take over a lot of plates and things.

264
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,280
- What plates?
- Oh, Mom,

265
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,840
I'm Chairman of the Eats Committee
and we only need a couple of dozen.

266
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,320
Oh, no, you don't. Harry,
now, not my best Haviland.

267
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,360
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

268
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,240
Hope you have a good trip, George.
Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.

269
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,360
I'll miss you too, Pop. What's
the matter? You look tired.

270
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,880
- Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
- Oh.

271
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,880
I thought when we put him on the board of
Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.

272
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,720
Oh, what's eating that old
money-grubbing buzzard anyway?

273
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,280
Oh, he's a sick man.
Frustrated and sick.

274
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,960
And his mind's sick in
his soul, if he has one.

275
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,880
He hates everybody that has
anything that he can't have.

276
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,600
He hates us mostly, I guess.

277
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,280
Gangway! Gangway! So long, Pop.

278
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,480
So long!

279
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,480
- Harry, you got a match?
- Very funny. Very funny.

280
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,960
Put those things in the car and I'll
get your tie and studs ready for you.

281
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,560
- Now, hurry up, hurry up.
- Okay, Mom.

282
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,840
- You coming later?
- Don't you drop one of those.

283
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,960
- You coming later, George?
- What do you mean,

284
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,920
- and be bored to death?
- Couldn't want a better death.

285
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,160
Lots of pretty girls, and we're going
to use that new floor tonight, too.

286
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,000
- Oh, I hope it works.
- No gin tonight, son!

287
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,560
- Aw, Pop, just a little.
- No, son. Not one drop.

288
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,760
Oh!

289
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,960
Boys and girls and music...
why do they need gin?

290
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,080
Father, did I act like that when
I graduated from high school?

291
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Pretty much.

292
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,520
You know, George, I wish we could
send Harry to college with you.

293
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,080
Your mother and I talked
it over half the night.

294
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,320
Mmm, we have that all figured out.

295
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,480
Harry'll take my job at the Building
and Loan, and work there four years,

296
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,760
then he'll go.

297
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,720
- He's pretty young for that job.
- Well, no younger than I was.

298
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Maybe you were born older, George.

299
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,520
How's that?

300
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,240
I say, you were born older.

301
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,520
I suppose you've decided what you
want to do when you get out of college.

302
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Oh well, you know what I've always
talked about... build things...

303
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,920
design new buildings...
plan modern cities...

304
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,880
- all that stuff.  - Still after that
first million before you're thirty.

305
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,320
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.

306
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,360
'Course it's just a hope, but uh,

307
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,960
you wouldn't consider coming back
to the Building and Loan, would you?

308
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,480
Well, I... I... Why, Annie, why,
why don't you draw up a chair?

309
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,560
Then you'd be more comfortable and you
could hear everything that's going on.

310
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,000
I would if I thought I'd hear
anything worth listening to.

311
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,880
You would, eh?

312
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,760
- I know it's soon to talk about it.
- Oh, now, Pop. I, I,

313
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:28,160
I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for
the rest of my life in a shabby little office...

314
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,600
Oh, I'm sorry, Pop, I
didn't mean it that way,

315
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,080
but this business of nickels and
dimes and spending all your life

316
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,800
trying to figure out how to save three
cents on a length of pipe... I'd go crazy.

317
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,440
I... I wanna do something
big and something important.

318
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,960
You know, George, I feel that in a small
way we are doing something important.

319
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,280
Satisfying a fundamental urge.

320
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,800
It's deep in the race for a man to want
his own roof and walls and fireplace.

321
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,320
And we're helping him get those
things in our shabby little office.

322
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:03,480
I know, Pop. I, uh, I, I know
that I, I... I wish I felt...

323
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,320
but I, I've been hoarding pennies
like a miser here in order to...

324
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,520
Most of my friends have
already finished college.

325
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,120
I, uh, I just feel like if
I didn't get away, I'd bust.

326
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,240
Yes, yes. You're right, son.

327
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,120
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

328
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,160
This town is no place for any man
unless he's willing to crawl to Potter.

329
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,400
And you've got talent,
son. I've seen it.

330
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,880
You get yourself an education.
Then get out of here.

331
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,520
Pop, you want a shock?

332
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
I think you're a great guy.

333
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,520
Oh, did you hear that, Annie?

334
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,440
I heard it. About time one
of you lunkheads said it.

335
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,600
I'm going to miss old Annie.

336
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,520
Pop, I think I'll get dressed
and go over to Harry's party.

337
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,960
Have a good time, son.

338
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,880
Here you are.

339
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,960
George! Hello!

340
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,280
You know my kid brother, George?
I'm going to put him through college.

341
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,960
- Hello, George!
- Hee-haw!

342
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,520
Oh, oh, Sam Wainwright.

343
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,800
How are you? When did you get here?

344
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,160
Oh, this afternoon. I thought
I'd give the kids a treat.

345
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,560
Old college graduate now, huh?

346
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,760
Yeah. Old Joe College
Wainwright, they call me.

347
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,360
Well, freshman, looks like
you're going to make it after all.

348
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
- Yep.
- Hey, hey!

349
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,600
Harry! You're the guy I want to see.

350
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,240
- The Coach has heard all about you.
- He has?

351
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,240
Yeah. He's followed every
game and his mouth's watering.

352
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,080
He wants me to find out if you're
going to come along with us.

353
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,000
Well, I eh, I gotta
make some dough first.

354
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,600
Well, you'd better make it fast.
We need great ends like you.

355
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,720
Not broken-down old
guys like this one!

356
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,600
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw!

357
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,400
George! Welcome back!

358
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,960
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?

359
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Putting a pool under this
floor was a great idea.

360
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,160
Saved us another building.

361
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.

362
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,080
There's lots of stuff
here to eat and drink.

363
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,840
- Lots of pretty girls around.
- Hey, George...

364
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,560
- Hello, Violet. How are you...
- Hello. What am I bid?

365
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,640
- George...
- Marty. Well, it's old home week.

366
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,760
Marty! Glad to see you.

367
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,760
- Do me a favor, will you, George?
- What's that?

368
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,240
- Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

369
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,920
"Mamma wants you, Marty."
"Mama wants you." Remember?

370
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,880
Dance with her, will you?

371
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh, me? Oh, well, I feel funny
enough already, with all these kids.

372
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,960
Aw, come on. Be a sport.

373
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,720
Just dance with her one time and
you'll give her the thrill of her life.

374
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,720
- Aw, go on.
- Hey, sis!

375
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,480
And don't be long, Marty! I don't
want to be a wet nurse for...

376
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,200
And the next thing I knew,
some guy came up and tripped me.

377
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,160
That's the reason
why I came in fourth.

378
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,160
If it hadn't been for that, that
race would have been a cinch.

379
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,040
I tried to find out who it was
later but I couldn't find out.

380
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,160
Nobody'd ever tell you who... whoever,
whoever it was because they'd be scared.

381
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,280
- They know what kind of a guy I am...
- You remember George?

382
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,440
- This is Mary. Well, I'll be seeing you.
- Well... well... well...

383
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,240
Now, to get back to my story, see...

384
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,400
Hey, this is my dance.

385
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,400
Oh, why don't you
stop annoying people?

386
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,360
Well, I'm sorry. Hey!

387
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,880
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

388
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,360
- You look at me as if you didn't know me.
- Well, I don't.

389
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,720
You've passed me on the
street almost every day.

390
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,320
Me?! Uh-huh.
Uh-uh.

391
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,400
That was a little girl named
Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

392
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,080
O-yes,
o-yes, o-yes!

393
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,720
The big Charleston contest!

394
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,880
The prize? A genuine loving cup!

395
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,040
Those not tapped by the judges
will remain on the floor. Let's go!

396
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,240
- I'm not very good at this.
- Neither am I.

397
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,840
Okay. What can we lose?

398
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,520
Hey, you're wonderful!

399
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,680
What's the matter, Othello, jealous?

400
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,720
Did you know there's a
swimming pool under this floor?

401
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,840
And did you know that button behind
you causes this floor to open up?

402
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:40,040
And did you further know that George
Bailey is dancing right over that crack?

403
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,080
And I've got the key?

404
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Stand back, everybody! Stand back!

405
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,720
They're cheering us. We must be good.

406
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,880
Get out! Oh, well...

407
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,600
Buffalo Gals, can't
you come out tonight?

408
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,440
Can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?

409
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,400
Buffalo Gals, can't
you come out tonight?

410
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,360
And dance

411
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:22,240
by the light of the moon.

412
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,760
- Oh, Hot dog! Just like an organ.
- Beautiful.

413
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,160
I told Harry I thought
I'd be bored to death.

414
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,000
You, you should have seen the
commotion in that locker room.

415
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,080
I, I had to knock off three people
to get this stuff we're wearing here.

416
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,600
Here, let me, let me hold
that old wet dress of yours.

417
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,000
Do I look as funny as you do?

418
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,640
I guess I'm not quite
the football type.

419
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,400
I... You, you look wonderful!

420
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,680
You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd
say you were the prettiest girl in town.

421
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,480
Well, why don't you say it?

422
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,560
Well, I don't know. Maybe I will
say it. How old are you anyway?

423
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,440
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen?!

424
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,240
Why, it was only last
year you were seventeen.

425
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,520
Too young or too old?

426
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,960
Oh, no, no. Just right.
Your age fits you.

427
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,000
Yes, sir, you look a little
older without your clothes on.

428
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,560
I, I mean, without a
dress. You look older.

429
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,440
I, I mean, younger. You
look... y-y-you just look...

430
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,760
- Oh, oh!
- Oh, oh!

431
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,520
- Oh, no. I wanna...
- Sir, my train, please!

432
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,640
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

433
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Your... your caboose, me lady.

434
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,360
- You may kiss my hand.
- Ummm.

435
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,680
Hey.

436
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,960
Hey, Mary.

437
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,640
As I was lumbering down the street,

438
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,600
down the street, down the street...

439
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,840
Okay then, I'll throw a rock
at the old Granville house.

440
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,120
Oh, no, don't! L-I
love that old house.

441
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,400
No. You see, you make a wish and
then try and break some glass.

442
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,000
And you got to be a pretty
good shot nowadays, too.

443
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,360
Oh, no, George, don't.

444
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,760
It's full of romance, that old place.

445
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,600
I'd like to live in it.

446
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,200
- In that
place?! - Uh-huh.

447
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,960
I wouldn't live in it
as a ghost. Now watch.

448
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,920
There's a window right on
the second floor there, see?

449
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,240
- What did you wish, George?
- Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful.

450
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,120
Mary, I know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow

451
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,040
and the next day and the next
year and the year after that.

452
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,920
I'm shaking the dust of this
crummy little town off my feet

453
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,560
and I'm gonna see the world.

454
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,000
Italy, Greece, the
Parthenon... the Colesseum.

455
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,520
Then I'm coming back here and go
to college and see what they know

456
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,240
and then I'm going to build things.

457
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,720
I'm gonna build air fields.

458
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,480
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
a hundred stories high.

459
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,440
I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.

460
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,360
Well, are you gonna throw a rock?

461
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,600
Hey, that's pretty good.

462
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,080
What'd you wish, Mary?

463
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,800
Buffalo Gals, Can't
you come out tonight?

464
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,800
Can't you come out tonight?
Can't you come out tonight?

465
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,760
Buffalo Gal, Can't
you come out tonight?

466
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:00,760
And dance by the light of the moon.

467
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,680
What'd you wish when
you threw that rock?

468
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,440
- Oh, no.
- Come on, tell me.

469
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,440
If I told you, it might not come true.

470
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,360
What is it you want, Mary?

471
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,360
What do you want?

472
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,120
You, you want the moon?!

473
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,680
Just say the word and I'll throw
a lasso around it and pull it down.

474
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,040
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.

475
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,000
- I'll give you the moon, Mary.
- I'll take it. Then what?

476
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,680
Well then, you could swallow it,

477
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,760
and it'd all dissolve, see?

478
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,200
And the moon beams'd shoot out
of your fingers and your toes

479
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,120
and the ends of your hair.

480
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,120
Am I talking too much?

481
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,400
Yes!

482
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,720
Why don't you kiss her instead
of talking her to death?

483
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,720
How's that?

484
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,800
Why don't you kiss her instead
of talking her to death?

485
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,240
Want me to kiss her, huh?

486
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,040
Aw, youth is wasted
on the wrong people!

487
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,400
Hey, hey, hold on. Hey,
mister, come on back out here.

488
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,200
I'll show you some kissing
that'll put hair back on your head.

489
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,520
What are you...

490
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,360
Mary?

491
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,080
Okay, I give up. Where are you?

492
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,840
Over here, in the hydrangea bushes.

493
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,240
Here you are. Catch.

494
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,000
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

495
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,040
This is a very interesting situation!

496
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,120
- Please give me my robe.
- Hmm.

497
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,880
A man doesn't get in a
situation like this every day.

498
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,760
I'd like to have my robe.

499
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,280
Not in Bedford Falls anyway.

500
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,680
- Ooooouch! Oh!
- Gesundheit.

501
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,680
- George Bailey!
- This requires a little thought here.

502
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,440
Give me my robe!

503
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,160
I've read about things
like this, but I never...

504
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,120
Shame on you! I'm going
to tell your mother on you!

505
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,040
Oh, my mother's way up
on the corner over there.

506
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,800
I'll call the police!

507
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,400
They're way downtown.
They'd be on my side, too.

508
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,360
Then, then, then I'm going to scream!

509
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,000
Maybe I could sell tickets.

510
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:17,240
Let's see. No, no, the point
is, in order to get this robe...

511
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,400
I've got it. I'll make
a deal with you, Mary.

512
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,200
George! George!

513
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,880
George! Come on home. Quick.

514
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,760
You father's had a stroke!

515
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,880
What?!

516
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,040
Mary! Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.

517
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,080
Come on, George. Let's hurry!

518
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,720
- Did you get a doctor?
- Yes. Campbell's there now.

519
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,520
I think that's all we'll need you for,
George, I know you're anxious to make a train.

520
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,160
I have a taxi waiting downstairs.

521
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,160
I want the Board to know that
George gave up his trip to Europe

522
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,440
to help straighten things out
here these past few months.

523
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,360
Good luck to you at school, George.

524
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,200
- Thanks.
- Good luck! So long!

525
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,760
Now we come to the real
purpose of this meeting...

526
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,520
to appoint a successor to
our dear friend, Peter Bailey.

527
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,760
Mr. Chairman, I'd like
to get to my real purpose.

528
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,000
- Wait just a minute now.
- Wait for what?

529
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,520
I claim this institution is
not necessary to this town.

530
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,840
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make a
motion to dissolve this institution

531
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,720
and turn its assets and
liabilities over to the receiver.

532
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,200
Potter, you dirty, contemptible...

533
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,440
I'll wring his neck,
so help me, George,

534
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,040
- you hear what that buzzard...
- Mr. Chairman,

535
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,560
it's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to
talk about chloroforming the Building and Loan.

536
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,840
Peter Bailey died three months ago.

537
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,680
I second Mr. Potter's motion.

538
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,680
Very well. In that case, I'll ask the
two executive officers to withdraw.

539
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,160
But before you go,

540
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,920
I'm sure the whole Board wishes
to express its deep sorrow

541
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,560
- at the passing of Peter Bailey.
- Thank you very much.

542
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,280
It was his faith and devotion that
are responsible for this organization.

543
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,200
I'll go further than that.

544
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,880
I'll say that to the public, Peter
Bailey was the Building and Loan.

545
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,080
Oh, that's fine,
Potter, coming from you,

546
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
considering that you probably
drove him to his grave.

547
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,120
Peter Bailey was not a business man.

548
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,640
That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean
any disrespect to him, God rest his soul.

549
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,440
He was a man of high
ideals, so-called.

550
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,440
But ideals without common
sense can ruin this town.

551
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,360
Now, you take this loan
here to Ernie Bishop...

552
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:25,360
you know, that fellow that sits around all
day on his brains in his taxi, you know.

553
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,800
I happen to know the bank turned
down this loan, but he comes here

554
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,480
and we're building him a house
worth five thousand dollars.

555
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,920
- Why?
- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.

556
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,160
You have all the papers there.

557
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,200
His salary, insurance. I can
personally vouch for his character.

558
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,800
- A friend of yours.
- Yes, sir.

559
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,440
You see, if you shoot pool
with some employee here,

560
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,080
you can come and borrow money.

561
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,840
What does that get us?

562
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,080
A discontented, lazy rabble
instead of a thrifty working class.

563
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,240
And all because a few starry-eyed
dreamers like Peter Bailey

564
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,520
stir them up and fill their heads
with a lot of impossible ideas.

565
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,000
- Now, I say...
- Just a minute. Just a...

566
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,400
Just a minute. Now,
hold on, Mr. Potter.

567
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,640
You're right when you say my father
was no business man. I know that.

568
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,000
Why he ever started this cheap penny-ante
Building and Loan, I'll never know.

569
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,400
But neither you nor anybody else can
say anything against his character,

570
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,320
because his whole life was...

571
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,080
Why, in the twenty-five years since
he and Uncle Billy started this thing,

572
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,760
he never once thought of himself.
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?

573
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,520
He didn't save enough money to
send Harry to school, let alone me.

574
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,200
But he did help a few people get
out of your slums, Mr. Potter.

575
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,440
And what's wrong with that?

576
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,160
Why... here, you are
all businessmen here.

577
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,360
Doesn't it make them better citizens?
Doesn't it make them better customers?

578
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,360
You... you said that uh... what'd
you say just a minute ago...

579
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,320
They, they had to wait and save their money
before they even thought of a decent home.

580
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,200
Wait! Wait for what?

581
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,720
Until their children
grow up and leave them?

582
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,160
Until they're so old and
broken-down that they...

583
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,280
Do you know how long it takes a working
man to save five thousand dollars?

584
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,320
Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that
this rabble you're talking about...

585
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,480
they do most of the working and paying
and living and dying in this community.

586
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,720
Well, it is too much to have
them work and pay and live and die

587
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
in a couple of decent
rooms and a bath?

588
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,960
Anyway, my father didn't think so.

589
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,040
People were human beings to him,

590
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,960
but to you, a warped, frustrated
old man, they're cattle.

591
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,480
Well, in my book, he died a much
richer man than you'll ever be.

592
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,880
I'm not interested in your book. I'm
talking about the Building and Loan.

593
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,680
I know very well what
you're talking about.

594
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,040
You're talking about something you can't
get your fingers on, and it's galling you.

595
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,480
That's what you're
talking about, I know.

596
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,280
Well, I, I, I've said too much.

597
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,000
I... You're, you're the Board here.
You do what you want with this thing.

598
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,440
There's j-just one thing more though.

599
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,600
This town needs this
measly one-horse institution

600
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,600
if only to have some place where people
can come without crawling to Potter.

601
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,840
Come on, Uncle Billy.

602
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,880
Sentimental hogwash. I want my motion.

603
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,120
Oh boy, that was telling
him, George, old boy.

604
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,320
You shut his big mouth.
You should have heard him.

605
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,480
What happened? We
heard a lot of yelling.

606
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,000
Well, we're being voted out of
business after twenty-five years.

607
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,400
Easy come, easy go.

608
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,520
Here it is. "Help wanted
- Female."

609
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,560
You still want me hang around, George?

610
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,800
Yeah, I'll be right down.

611
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,960
Hey, you'll miss your train.

612
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,800
You're a week late for
school already. Go on.

613
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,800
- What's going on in there?
- Oh, never mind. Don't worry about that.

614
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,960
They're putting us out
of business. So what?

615
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,120
I can get another job.
I'm only fifty-five.

616
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,760
- Fifty-six.
- Go on, go on.

617
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,040
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip, now
you don't want to miss college, too, do you?

618
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,160
George! George!

619
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,640
They voted Potter down.
They want to keep it going.

620
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,080
- Whoopee!
- You did it, George, you did it.

621
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,960
But they got one condition,
only one condition.

622
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,760
- What's that?
- That's the best part of it.

623
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,200
They've appointed George here as Executive
Secretary to take his father's place.

624
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,440
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...

625
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,320
You can keep him on. That's all right.

626
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,160
As Secretary you can
hire anyone you like.

627
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,120
Dr. Campbell, now let's
get this thing straight.

628
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,600
I'm leaving. I'm leaving right now.

629
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,400
I'm going to school.
This is my last chance.

630
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,880
Uncle Billy here, he's your man.

631
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,560
But, George, they'll vote
with Potter otherwise.

632
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,280
I know, I know, he didn't go.

633
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,320
That's right.

634
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,960
Not only that, but he gave his school money
to his brother, Harry, and sent him to college.

635
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,800
Harry became a football star.

636
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,960
Made second team All-American.

637
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
Yeah, but what happened to George?

638
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,240
George got four years older,
waiting for Harry to come back

639
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,960
and take over the Building and Loan.

640
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,720
Oh, there are plenty of jobs around
for somebody that likes to travel.

641
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,840
Look at this. There...

642
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,320
Venezuela oil fields
- Wanted. Man with construction experience.

643
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:33,120
Here's the Yukon, oh, right here -
wanted - man with engineering experience.

644
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,760
There she blows.

645
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,240
You know what the three most
exciting sounds in the world are?

646
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,640
- Uh-huh. - Breakfast is served,
lunch is served, dinner...

647
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,200
No, no, no, no!

648
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,840
- Anchor chains, plane motors,
and train whistles.  - Peanut?

649
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,080
There's the Professor now.

650
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,040
- Phil Beta Kappa Bailey! All-American. -
Old George Geographic Explorer Bailey.

651
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,840
What? No husky dogs? No sled?

652
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,320
Uncle Billy, you
haven't changed a bit.

653
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,760
- Nobody ever changes here, you know that.
- Oh, am I glad to see you.

654
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,920
- Say, where's mother?
- She's home, cooking the fatted calf.

655
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,000
- Come on. Let's go.
- Oh, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

656
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,000
George, Uncle Billy, I
want you to meet Ruth.

657
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,320
- Hello.
- How do you do.

658
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,160
- Ruth Dakin.
- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

659
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,200
Huh?

660
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,760
Well, I wired you I had a surprise.
Here she is. Meet the wife.

661
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,680
Well, what do you know
- wife.

662
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,160
Well, how do you do. Congratulations.

663
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,520
What am I doing? Congratulations!

664
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,480
They're married... why
didn't you tell somebody?

665
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,920
...Oh, I can't wait
to see Tilly's face.

666
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,280
- Did you really marry him?
- Why, yes...

667
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,680
What's a pretty girl like you doing
marrying this two-headed brother of mine?

668
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,320
Well, I tell you.
It's purely mercenary.

669
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,560
My father offered him a job.

670
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,240
Oh, he gets you and a job?
Well, Harry's cup runneth over.

671
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,160
Uh, George, about that
job, Ruth spoke out of turn.

672
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,880
I never said I'd take it.

673
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,800
You've been holding the bag
here for four years, and...

674
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,360
well, I won't let you down, George.

675
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,680
I would like to... Oh, wait
a minute. I forgot the bags.

676
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,800
I'll be right back.

677
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,400
It was a surprise to me. This is the
new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife.

678
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,160
Old, old friends of the family.

679
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,320
- Oh, of course, I've heard him speak of you.
- And I want you to tell you,

680
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:15,880
we're going to give the biggest
party this town ever saw.

681
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,760
Here, have some popcorn.

682
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,600
George, George, George, that's
all Harry ever talks about.

683
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,960
Uh, uh, uh, Ruth, uh, this,
uh, what about this job?

684
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,840
Oh, well, my father owns
a glass factory in Buffalo.

685
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,680
He wants to get Harry started
in the research business.

686
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,200
- Well, is it a good job?
- Oh, yes, very.

687
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,640
- Not much money, but, uh, good future, you know.
- I know.

688
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,600
Harry's a genius at research.

689
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,840
- My father just fell in love with him.
- And you did, too.

690
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,840
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

691
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,960
I feel so good. I could
spit in Potter's eye.

692
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,840
I think I will. I think I will.

693
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,120
What did you say? Huhh?

694
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,240
Oh, maybe I'd better go home.

695
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Where's my hat? Where's my...

696
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,920
Oh! Oh, thank you,
George, which is mine?

697
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,240
- The middle one.
- Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy.

698
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,040
Now, look, if you'll point me in the right
direction... would you do that, George?

699
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,480
- Right down here.
- Oh... Old Building and Loan pal, huh...

700
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,880
Now you just turn this way and
go right straight down there.

701
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,120
That way, huh?

702
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,000
My Wild Irish rose...

703
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,120
I'm all right. I'm all
right. +++++++++++++++++++++++

704
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:48,840
La flor mas dulce que crece...

705
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,360
Hola, Mami.

706
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,120
No es nada.

707
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,280
- Que te parece ella?
- Oh, est bien.

708
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,880
Parece que puede mantener
a Harry en lnea recta.

709
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,400
Lo mantendr fuera de
Bedford Falls de todos modos.

710
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,320
Sabas que Mary Hatch
regres ya del Colegio?

711
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,720
- Ah-hah. -
Regres hace 3 das.

712
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,440
Hmmm...

713
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,080
- Linda chica, Mary.
- Hmmm.

714
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,120
De la clase que te ayudar a
encontrar las respuestas, George.

715
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,240
- Hmmm...
- Oh, deja de gruir.

716
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,480
Hmmm.

717
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,000
Podras darme una buena
razon para no llamar a Mary?

718
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,680
- Seguro, Sam Wainwright.
- Hmmm?

719
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,080
- Si, Sam est loco por Mary.
- Pero, ella no est loca por l.

720
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,000
Bien, como lo sabes?

721
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,560
- Acaso, lo discuti contigo?
- No.

722
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,680
- Bueno entonces, como lo sabes?
- Bueno, tengo ojos, no?

723
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,720
Pues, ella titila como una
lucirnaga en cuanto t andas cerca.

724
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,880
Oh...

725
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,240
Y ademas, Sam Wainwright est lejos
en N. York y t aqu en Bedford Falls.

726
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,960
Y todo vale en la guerra y el amor.

727
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,480
Bueno, no conozco de la guerra.

728
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,120
Madre ma, puedo ver atravez tuyo
justo atras del botn del collar...

729
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,400
- tratando de librarte
de m, hah? - Ah-hah.

730
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,000
Bien, aqu est tu
sombrero, que es tu prisa.

731
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,880
Muy bien, Madre, Old
Building y el conpinche Loan,

732
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,080
creo que saldr y encontrar la chica y
le dar un apasionado beso en el cuello.

733
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,560
Oh, George...

734
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,720
Ahora si me colocas en
la direccin correcta...

735
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,640
esta direccin?

736
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,360
Buenas noches, Mrs. Bailey.

737
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,440
- Perdname...
- Ahora, espera un minuto.

738
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,680
Creo que tengo una cita.

739
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,320
But uh, stick around,
fellows, just in case, huh?

740
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,400
We'll wait for you, baby.

741
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,480
- Hello,
George-Porgie! - What?

742
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,400
- Hey, uh... What gives?
- Nothing.

743
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,640
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I'm... probably end up down at the library.

744
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,880
Georgie, don't you ever get tired
of just reading about things?

745
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,280
- Yes. What are you doing tonight?
- Not a thing.

746
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,680
Are you game, Violet?
Let's make a night of it.

747
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,880
Oh, I'd love it,
Georgie. What'll we do?

748
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,280
Let's go out in the fields and take off
our shoes, and walk through the grass.

749
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,280
Huh?

750
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,400
Then we can to up to the falls. It's
beautiful up there in the moonlight,

751
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,640
and there's a green pool up there,

752
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,960
and we can, uh, s-swim in it.

753
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,160
Then we can climb Mt. Bedford,

754
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,200
and smell the pines and watch
the sunrise against the peaks,

755
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,640
and we'll stay up
there the whole night,

756
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,680
and everybody'll be talking and
there'll be a terrific scandal...

757
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,560
Georgie, have you gone crazy?

758
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Walk in the grass in my bare feet?

759
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,680
- Why, it's ten miles up to Mt. Bedford.
- Shhh...

760
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,120
- You think just because you... -
O-O-Okay, just forget about the whole thing.

761
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,760
What are you doing, picketing?

762
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,480
Hello, Mary.

763
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,800
I just happened to be passing by.

764
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,080
Yes, so I noticed.

765
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,480
- Have you made up your mind?
- How's that?

766
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,000
Have you made up your mind?

767
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,240
- About what?
- About coming in.

768
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,000
Your mother just phoned and said you
were on your way over to pay me a visit.

769
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,280
My mother just called you?
Well, how did she know?

770
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,480
- Didn't you tell her?
- I didn't tell anybody.

771
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,640
I just went for a walk and
happened to be passing by, idiot.

772
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,200
What do you... went
for a walk. That's all.

773
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,880
- I'll be downstairs, mother.
- All right, dear.

774
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,400
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?

775
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,520
Well, I'll come in
for a minute. But I...

776
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,520
I didn't tell anybody I was
coming over here, you know.

777
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,200
- When did you get back?
- Tuesday.

778
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,040
Where'd you get that dress?

779
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,520
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.

780
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,240
I thought you'd go back to New York
like Sam and Angie, and the rest of them.

781
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,760
Oh, oh, I worked there a
couple of vacations. But...

782
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,800
I don't know... l-I
guess I was homesick.

783
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,120
Homesick? For Bedford Falls?

784
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:41,960
Yes, and my family,
and... Oh, everything.

785
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,720
Would you like to sit down?

786
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,440
All right, for a minute.

787
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,720
L-I still can't understand it though. You
know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.

788
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,880
Would you rather leave?

789
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,880
No, I don't want to be rude.

790
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,680
Well, then sit down.

791
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,800
What's this?

792
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,480
Some joke, huh?

793
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:12,120
Well, I see it still smells
like pine needles around here.

794
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,160
Thank you.

795
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,360
And dance by the...

796
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,600
What's the matter?

797
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,840
Oh, oh, yeah... yeah...

798
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,600
Well, I...

799
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,040
It was nice about your brother
Harry, and Ruth, isn't it?

800
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,520
Oh... yeah, yeah. That's all right.

801
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,640
Don't you like her?

802
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,960
Well, of course, I
like her. She's a peach.

803
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,640
Oh, it's just marriage in general
you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

804
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,960
No. Uh, marriage is all right for
Harry and Marty and Sam and you.

805
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,680
Mary! Mary!

806
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,520
Who's down there with you?

807
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,240
It's George Bailey, Mother.

808
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,200
George Bailey?! What's he want?

809
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,720
I don't know.

810
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,200
What do you want?

811
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,160
Me?

812
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,800
Not a thing. L-I just
came in to get warm.

813
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,600
He's making violent
love to me, Mother.

814
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,880
You tell him to go right back home,
and don't you leave the house, either.

815
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,040
Sam Wainwright promised to
call you from New York tonight.

816
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,560
But your mother needn't...

817
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,200
You know I
- I didn't come here to...

818
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,600
What did you come here for then?

819
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,720
I don't know. You tell me.

820
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,520
You're supposed to be the
one that has all the answers.

821
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,280
- You tell me.
- Why don't you go home?

822
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,200
That's where I'm going. I don't know
why I came here in the first place.

823
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,720
- Good night.
- Good night!

824
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,240
Mary! Mary!

825
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,200
- The telephone. It's Sam!
- I'll get it.

826
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,520
Whatever were you doing
that you couldn't hear?

827
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,400
Mary, he'swaiting!

828
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,040
Hello.

829
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,200
I forgot my hat.

830
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,520
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?

831
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,520
Aw, I'm great. Gee, it's
good to hear your voice again.

832
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,240
Oh, well, that's awfully
sweet of you, Sam.

833
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,720
There's an old friend of
yours here. George Bailey.

834
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,120
You mean old moss-back George?

835
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,480
Yes. Old moss-back George.

836
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,280
Hee-haw! Put him on.

837
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,640
W-Wait just a minute.
L-I'll call him. George!

838
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,920
He doesn't want to speak
to George, you idiot!

839
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,120
He does so. He asked for him.

840
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,480
Geo-George! George, Sam
wants to speak to you.

841
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,040
- Hi, Sam.
- Well, George Bailoffski!

842
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,720
Hey, a fine pal you are.

843
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,680
What're you trying
to do? Steal my girl?

844
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,600
W-W-What do you mean? Nobody's
trying to steal anybody's girl.

845
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,520
H-Here... here's Mary.

846
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,160
No, no, wait a minute. Wait a
minute. I want to talk to both of you.

847
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,320
- Here to you.
- Tell Mary to get on the extension.

848
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,440
- You tell him.
- Mother's on the extension. We...

849
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,720
I am not!

850
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,000
We can both hear. Come here.

851
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,080
We-We're listening, Sam.

852
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,720
Well look, I have a big deal coming
up that's going to make us all rich.

853
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,680
George, you remember that
night in Martini's Bar when, eh,

854
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,840
you told me you read someplace about
making plastics out of soybeans?

855
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,040
Jelly beans?

856
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,080
Shut up, will you?

857
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,080
Do you remember out of jelly
- ...out of soybeans?

858
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,000
Huh? Yeah, yeah,
yeah... soybeans. Yeah.

859
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,840
Well, listen. Dad snapped up the idea.

860
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,160
And he's going to build a
factory outside of Rochester.

861
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,480
How do you like that?

862
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,120
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

863
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,040
Well, why not? Can you
think of anything better?

864
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,800
Oh, I don't know... It's just...

865
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,400
Why not right here?

866
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,280
Y-You remember that... that
old tool and machinery works?

867
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,120
W-Well, you tell your father
he can get that for a song.

868
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,360
And all the labor he wants, too.

869
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,240
Half the town was thrown out
of work when they closed down.

870
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,480
Is that so? Well, I'll tell him.

871
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,960
Hey, that sounds great.

872
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,840
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.

873
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,160
Now here's the point,

874
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,680
Mary... Mary, you're in on this, too.
Now listen, have you got any money?

875
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,000
- Money? Yeah... well, a little.
- Well now, listen.

876
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,880
I want you to put every cent
you've got into our stock, you hear?

877
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,520
And George, I may have a job for you,

878
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,880
that is, unless you're still married
to that broken-down Building and Loan.

879
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,960
Well, this is the biggest thing since radio.
And I'm letting you in on the ground floor.

880
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,280
Oh, Mary... Mary...

881
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,480
Well, l-I'm here.

882
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,360
Uh, would you tell that guy I'm giving
him the chance of a lifetime, you hear?

883
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,320
The chance of a lifetime.

884
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,800
H-He says it's the
chance of a lifetime.

885
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,480
Now you listen to me.

886
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,600
I don't want any plastics. I
don't want any ground floors.

887
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,160
And I don't want to get married
ever to anyone. You understand that?

888
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,440
I want to do what I want to do.

889
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,720
And you're... and you're...

890
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,560
- Oh, Mary... Mary...
- George... George... George...

891
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:07,000
Mary... Would you? Would you...

892
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,280
Here they come! Here they come!

893
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,040
Goodbye.

894
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,000
First Harry. Now George.

895
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,320
Annie, we're just two old maids now.

896
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,440
You speak for yourself, Mrs. B.

897
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,520
If either of you two see a
stranger around here, it's me.

898
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,200
Hey, look! There's
somebody driving this cab.

899
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,120
Bert the cop sent this over.

900
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,400
He said to float away to
Happy Land on the bubbles.

901
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,000
- Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!
- Good old Bert.

902
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,080
By the way, where are you two
going on this here now honeymoon?

903
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,400
Where are we going?

904
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,440
Look at this. There's
the kitty, Ernie.

905
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,160
Here, come on, count it, Mary.

906
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,000
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look!

907
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,320
You know what we're going to do?
We're going to shoot the works.

908
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,600
A whole week in New York.
A whole week in Bermuda.

909
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,240
The highest hotels,
the oldest champagne,

910
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,840
the richest caviar, the hottest
music, and the prettiest wife!

911
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,360
Wow! That does it! Then what?

912
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,760
- Then what, honey?
- After that, who cares?

913
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,080
That does it, come here,
come here, come here!

914
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,920
Don't look now, but there's something funny
going on over there at the bank, George.

915
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,640
I've never really seen one, but that's
got all the earmarks of being a run.

916
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,360
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money
in the bank, you better hurry.

917
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,120
- George, let's not stop. Let's go.
- Just a minute, dear.

918
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,200
- Oh-oh... - Please,
let's not stop, George.

919
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,560
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.

920
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,240
Well, hello, everybody.
Mrs. Thompson, how are you?

921
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,720
Charlie? What's the matter
here, can't you get in?

922
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,600
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?

923
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,320
George...

924
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,480
Come on in, everybody. That's right.

925
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,800
Just come on in.

926
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,360
Now look, why don't you all sit down?

927
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,080
There are a lot of seats over there.

928
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,920
Just make yourself at home.

929
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,080
George, can I see you a minute?

930
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,160
- Why didn't you call me?
- I just did, but they said you left.

931
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,760
This is a pickle,
George. This is a pickle.

932
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,280
All right now, what
happened? How did it start?

933
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,880
Well, how does a thing like this ever start?
All I know is the bank called our loan.

934
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,160
- When?
- About an hour ago.

935
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,040
- I had to hand over all our cash.
- All of it?

936
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,880
Every cent of it and it
still was less than we owe.

937
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,680
Holy mackerel!

938
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,520
And then I got scared, George, and
closed the doors. I... I... I...

939
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,400
The whole town's gone crazy.

940
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,880
Yes, h-hello?

941
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,080
George, it's Potter.

942
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,360
- Hello?
- George,

943
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,920
there is a rumor around town that
you've closed your doors. Is that true?

944
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,040
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear
that. George, are you all right?

945
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,760
- Do you need any police?
- Police? What's for?

946
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,000
Well, mobs get pretty
ugly sometimes, you know.

947
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:13,200
George, I'm going all out
to help in this crisis.

948
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:18,680
I've just guaranteed the bank
sufficient funds to meet their needs.

949
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,000
They'll close up for
a week and then reopen.

950
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,080
He just took over the bank.

951
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,440
I may lose a fortune, but I'm
willing to guarantee your people too.

952
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:35,680
Just tell them to bring their shares over
here, and I will pay fifty cents on the dollar.

953
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,920
Aw, you never miss a
trick, do you, Potter?

954
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Well, you're gonna miss this one.

955
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:43,000
If you close your doors before
six P.M., you will never reopen.

956
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,880
George, was it a nice wedding?
Gosh, I wanted to be there.

957
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,880
Yeah...

958
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,720
You can take this one off now.

959
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,880
Now, just remember that this
thing isn't as black as it appears.

960
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,200
I have some news for you folks.

961
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,520
I was just talking to old man Potter and
he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank.

962
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,320
The bank's going to reopen next week.

963
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,040
But, George, I got my money here.

964
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,800
Did he guarantee this place?

965
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,600
Well, no, Charlie. I
didn't even ask him.

966
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,320
- We don't need Potter over here.
- I'll take mine now.

967
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,520
No, but you... you... you're
thinking of this place all wrong.

968
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,360
As if I had the money back in a safe.

969
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,400
The, the money's not here.

970
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,920
Well, your money's in Joe's
house... that's right next to yours.

971
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,920
And in the Kennedy House, and Mrs.
Macklin's house, and, and a hundred others.

972
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,720
Why, you're lending
them the money to build,

973
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,480
and then, they're going to pay
it back to you as best they can.

974
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,840
Now what are you going
to do? Foreclose on them?

975
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,080
I got two hundred and
forty-two dollars in here

976
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,600
and two hundred and forty-two
dollars isn't going to break anybody.

977
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,720
Okay, Tom. All right. Here
you are. You sign this.

978
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,920
- You'll get your money in sixty days.
- Sixty days?

979
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,160
Well, now that's what you agreed
to when you bought you shares.

980
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,240
- Tom... Tom... Did you get your money?
- No.

981
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,080
Well, I did. Old man Potter'll pay fifty
cents on the dollar for every share you got.

982
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,840
- Fifty cents on the dollar!
- Yes, cash!

983
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,440
- Well, what do you say?
- Now, Tom,

984
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,160
you have to stick to
your original agreement.

985
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,680
- Now give us sixty days on this.
- Okay, Randall.

986
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,560
- Are you going to go to Potter's?
- Better get half than nothing.

987
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,520
Tom! Tom!

988
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,600
Randall, now wait a minute, wait...

989
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,560
now listen... now listen to me.

990
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,960
L-I beg of you not to do this thing.

991
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,680
If Potter gets ahold of
this Building and Loan,

992
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,000
there'll never be another
decent house built in this town.

993
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,280
He's already got charge of the
bank. He's got the bus line.

994
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,600
He's got the department
stores. And now he's after us.

995
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,120
Why? Well, it's very simple.

996
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,480
Because we're cutting in
on his business, that's why.

997
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,760
And because he wants to
keep you living in his slums

998
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,800
and paying the kind
of rent he decides.

999
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,640
Joe, you had one of those Potter houses,
didn't you? Well, have you forgotten?

1000
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,440
Have you forgotten what he
charged for that broken-down shack?

1001
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,480
Here, Ed. You know, you remember last
year when things weren't going so well,

1002
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,760
you couldn't make your payments.

1003
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,880
You didn't lose your house, did you? Do
you think Potter would have let you keep it?

1004
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,960
Ca-Can't you understand
what's happening here?

1005
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,640
Don't you see what's happening?

1006
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,800
Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying.

1007
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,760
And why? Because we're panicky
and he's not. That's why.

1008
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,880
He's picking up some bargains.

1009
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,480
Now, We-We can get through
this thing all right.

1010
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,920
We-We've got to stick together, though.
We've got to have faith in each other.

1011
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,040
But my husband hasn't worked
in over a year and I need money.

1012
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,480
- How am I going to live until the bank opens?
- I got doctor bills to pay.

1013
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,120
- I need cash.
- I can't feed my kids on faith.

1014
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,160
How much do you need?

1015
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,520
Hey! I got two thousand dollars.

1016
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,000
Here's two thousand dollars. This'll
tide us over until the bank reopens.

1017
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,360
All right, Tom, how much do you need?

1018
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,640
Two hundred and forty-two dollars.

1019
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,120
Aw, Tom, just enough to tide
you over till the bank reopens.

1020
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,840
I'll take two hundred
and forty-two dollars.

1021
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,360
- There you are.
- That'll close my account.

1022
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,480
Your account's still
here. That's a loan.

1023
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,200
Okay. All right, Ed?

1024
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,560
- I got three hundred dollars here, George.
- Alright, now, Ed...

1025
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,560
wh-wh-what'll it take till the
bank opens? What do you need?

1026
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,880
- Well, l-I suppose twenty dollars.
- Twenty dollars. Now you're talking.

1027
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,000
Fine. Thanks, Ed.

1028
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,640
All right now, Mrs. Thompson,
how much do you want?

1029
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,520
- But it's your own money, George.
- Never mind about that.

1030
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,000
- How much do you want?
- I can get along with twenty, all right.

1031
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,000
- Twenty dollars.
- And I'll sign a paper.

1032
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,080
You don't have to sign anything.

1033
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,000
I know you-you'll
pay it when you can.

1034
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,840
That's okay. All right, Mrs. Davis?

1035
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,960
- Could I have
seventeen-fifty? - Seven...

1036
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,040
Bless your heart, of course you
can have it. You got fifty cents?

1037
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,440
- Seven...
- We're going to make it, George.

1038
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,320
- They'll never close us up today!
- Six, five, four,

1039
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,600
three, two, one...

1040
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,920
Bingo!

1041
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,120
We made it. Close the door,
Ernie. We made it. Look.

1042
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,280
Look, we're still in business.
We're still got two bucks left.

1043
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,440
Well, look, let's have some
of that. Let's celebrate, huh.

1044
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,960
G-Get some glasses, Tilly.

1045
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,880
Well, a couple of financial wizards.

1046
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,480
Those Rockefellers.

1047
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,920
Get a tray for these two great
big important simoleans here.

1048
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,560
We'll save them for seed. A toast.

1049
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,960
A toast! A toast to Mama
Dollar and to Papa Dollar,

1050
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,320
and if you want to keep this old
Building and Loan in business,

1051
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,600
- you better have a family real quick.
- I wish they were rabbits.

1052
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,920
I wish they were, too.

1053
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,440
Okay, let's put them in
safe and see what happens.

1054
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:27,280
- Folks, folks, wedding
cigars! - Oh-oh... wedding!

1055
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,800
Holy mackerel, I'm married!
Where's Mary? Mary...

1056
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,840
Well, poor Mary.

1057
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,960
Look, I've got a train to
catch. Well, the train's gone.

1058
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,600
I wonder if Ernie's still
here with his taxicab?

1059
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,000
George, there's a call for you.

1060
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,880
Look, will you get my wife on the phone?
She's probably over at her mother's.

1061
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,760
- Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.
- I don't want Mrs. Bailey.

1062
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,600
I want my wife. Mrs. Bailey!
Mrs... oh, that's my wife.

1063
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,600
Here, I'll take it in here.

1064
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:53,160
Mary! Hello. Listen,
dear. I'm sorry...

1065
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,560
What? Come home? What home?

1066
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,760
Three-twenty Sycamore? Well, what...

1067
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:04,800
whose home is that?
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?

1068
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,760
Hey, this is the company's posters,
and the company won't like this.

1069
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,920
How would you like to
get a ticket next week?

1070
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,880
- Haven't you any romance in you?
- Sure I have, but I got rid of it.

1071
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,000
Liver pills!

1072
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,840
Who wants to see liver
pills on their honeymoon?

1073
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,840
What we want is romantic places, beautiful
places... places George wants to go.

1074
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,440
- Hey, Bert. Here he comes.
- Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.

1075
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,320
- Who?
- The groom, idiot.

1076
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,320
This is their honeymoon.
Come on. Get that ladder.

1077
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,640
What are they
- ducks?

1078
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,160
- Get that ladder up here.
- All right, all right.

1079
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,560
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

1080
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,640
Hiya... Geo... uh...
good evening, sir.

1081
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,640
Entree, Monsieur.

1082
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:14,760
- Entree.
- Islands of Hawaii,

1083
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:24,040
Where skies of blue are calling me.

1084
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:33,280
Where balmy air and golden moonlight

1085
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:42,480
caress The waving palms of Waikiki.

1086
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.

1087
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,440
Well, I'll be...

1088
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,720
Mary, where did you...

1089
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:54,880
I Love You Truly,

1090
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:59,960
Truly, Dear.

1091
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,520
Life with Its Shadows,

1092
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,560
Oh, Mary...

1093
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,400
Life with Its Tears.

1094
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,200
Remember the night we broke
the windows in this old house?

1095
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:15,640
Fade into Dreams,
- This is what I wished for.

1096
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,600
When I Feel You Are Near,

1097
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:29,320
- Darling, you're
wonderful. I Love You Truly,

1098
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:36,400
Truly, Dear.

1099
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,960
- Martini, you rented a new house?
- Rent?

1100
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,720
- You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?
- What's that?

1101
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,640
I own the house.

1102
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:58,040
Me, Giuseppe Martini,
I own my own house.

1103
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:01,520
No more we live like pigs
in this Potter's Field.

1104
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,920
Hurry, Marie!

1105
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,400
Come on... Bring the baby.

1106
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,080
This is like a dream!

1107
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,680
I'll take the kids in the car.

1108
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,520
Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey.

1109
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,280
All right, kids. Here.

1110
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,320
Get in here.

1111
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,320
Now get right up on the seat there.

1112
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,440
Get the... get the dog!

1113
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,240
You've got a goat too!

1114
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:30,240
- All right. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, everybody!

1115
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:33,960
All in.

1116
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,800
Mr. And Mrs. Martini, welcome home.

1117
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,880
Good old George. He's
always making a speech.

1118
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,920
Hee-haw!

1119
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,920
- Sam Wainwright!
- Oh, who cares!

1120
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Bread! That this house
may never know hunger.

1121
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,240
Salt! That life may
always have flavor!

1122
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:16,080
And wine!! That joy and
prosperity may reign forever.

1123
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,000
Enter the Martini castle!

1124
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,120
Look, Mr. Potter, it's
no skin off my nose.

1125
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,960
I'm just your little rent collector.

1126
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,840
But you can't laugh off this
Bailey Park anymore. Look at it.

1127
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,600
Congressman Black is here to see you.

1128
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:34,000
Oh, tell the congressman
to wait. Go on.

1129
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,680
Fifteen years ago, a half-dozen
houses stuck here and there.

1130
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,280
There's the old cemetery,
squirrels, buttercups, daisies.

1131
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,080
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.

1132
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,840
Look at it today.

1133
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,840
Dozens of the prettiest
little homes you ever saw.

1134
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,240
Ninety per cent owned by suckers
who used to pay rent to you!

1135
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:53,600
Your Potter's Field, my dear Mr.
Employer, is becoming just that.

1136
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:57,160
And are the local yokels making with
those David and Goliath wisecracks.

1137
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,840
Oh, they are, are they?

1138
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,760
Even though they know the Baileys
never made a dime out of it.

1139
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,000
You know very well why,

1140
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,400
the Baileys were all chumps.

1141
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,640
Every one of these homes is worth twice
what it cost the Building and Loan to build.

1142
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,320
- If I were you, Mr. Potter...
- Well, you are not me.

1143
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,680
As I say, it's no skin off my nose.

1144
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:22,360
But one of these days this bright young man
is going to be asking George Bailey for a job.

1145
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,600
The Bailey family has been a
boil on my neck long enough.

1146
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,880
- Yes, sir?
- Come in here.

1147
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,880
We just stopped in town to take a
look at the new factory, and then

1148
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,840
- we're going to drive on down to Florida.
- Oh...

1149
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,440
- Why don't you have your friends join us?
- Why, sure.

1150
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:40,360
Hey, why don't you kids
drive down with us, huh?

1151
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,160
Oh, I'm afraid I
couldn't get away, Sam.

1152
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,240
Still got the nose to
the old grindstone, eh?

1153
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:50,240
Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground
floor in plastics and he turned me down cold.

1154
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:53,000
- Oh, now don't rub it in.
- I'm not rubbing it in.

1155
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,760
Well, I guess we better run along.

1156
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,120
Awfully glad to have met you, Mary.

1157
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,400
- Nice meeting you.
- Goodbye.

1158
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,840
- Goodbye, George.
- So long, George.

1159
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,560
- See you in the funny papers.
- Goodbye, Sam.

1160
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,240
- So long, Mary.
- So long, Sam. Have fun.

1161
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,320
Thanks for dropping around.

1162
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,120
Florida! Hee-haw!

1163
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,200
Hee-haw.

1164
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,520
Thank you, sir.

1165
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,400
Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.

1166
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,920
You like it? I'll send you a box.

1167
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,880
Well, I, uh, I suppose I'll
find out sooner or later,

1168
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:56,160
but just what exactly did
you want to see me about?

1169
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:03,080
George, now that's just what
I like so much about you.

1170
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,800
George, I'm an old man,
and most people hate me.

1171
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,800
But I don't like them, either,
so that that makes it all even.

1172
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:14,880
You know, just as well as I do, that I
run practically everything in this town

1173
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,760
but the Bailey Building and Loan.

1174
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:22,520
You know, also, that for a number of years I've
been trying to get control of it or kill it.

1175
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,880
But I haven't been able to do it.

1176
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,800
You have been stopping me.

1177
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:31,120
In fact, you have beaten me, George,

1178
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:36,240
and as anyone in this county can
tell you, that takes some doing.

1179
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,440
Take during the
depression, for instance.

1180
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,720
You and I were the only
ones that kept our heads.

1181
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:46,080
You saved the Building and
Loan, I saved all the rest.

1182
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,920
Yeah. Well, most people
say you stole all the rest.

1183
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:53,720
The envious ones say
that, George, the suckers.

1184
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:58,240
Now, I have stated
my side very frankly.

1185
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,200
Now, let's look at your side.

1186
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:08,200
Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight,
married, making say... forty a week.

1187
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,200
- Forty-five! -
Forty-five. Forty-five.

1188
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,160
Out of which, after
supporting your mother

1189
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:18,800
and paying your bills, you're able
to keep, say ten, if you skimp.

1190
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:22,640
But, George Bailey is not
a common, ordinary yokel.

1191
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:26,760
He's an intelligent,
smart, ambitious young man,

1192
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:32,000
who hates his job, who hates the
Building and Loan, almost as much as I do.

1193
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:37,200
A young man who's been dying to get
out on his own ever since he was born.

1194
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,200
A young man... the smartest
one of the crowd, mind you,

1195
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:43,680
a young man who has to sit by
and watch his friends go places,

1196
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,320
because he's trapped.

1197
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:53,280
Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away
playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters.

1198
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,680
Do I paint a correct
picture, or do I exaggerate?

1199
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,400
Oh, what's your point, Mr. Potter?

1200
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,120
- My point? My point is, I want to hire you.
- Hire me?

1201
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,720
I want you to manage my
affairs, run my properties.

1202
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,880
George, I'll start you out at
twenty thousand dollars a year.

1203
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,800
Twenty thous... twenty
thousand dollars a year?

1204
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,280
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

1205
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,880
buying your wife a
lot of fine clothes,

1206
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,760
a couple of business trips to New York
a year, maybe once in a while Europe.

1207
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,400
You wouldn't mind
that, would you, George?

1208
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,840
Would I?

1209
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,080
Y-You're not talking to somebody
else around here, are you?

1210
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,120
You know, th-this is me, you
remember me? George Bailey.

1211
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:47,080
Oh, yes, George Bailey.
Whose ship has just come in,

1212
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,440
provided he has enough
brains to climb aboard.

1213
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,080
Holy mackerel!

1214
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,640
Well, how about the Building and Loan?

1215
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:09,280
Oh, confound it, man!
Are you afraid of success?

1216
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:14,360
I'm offering you a three-year contract at
twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today.

1217
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,200
Is it a deal, or isn't it?

1218
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,560
Well, Mr. Potter, I...

1219
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:24,400
I... I know I ought to jump at
the chance but I... I just, uh,

1220
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:28,400
l-I wonder if-if it would be possible for you
to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?

1221
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,200
Sure, sure, sure.

1222
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,000
You go on home and talk
about it to your wife.

1223
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,560
- I'd like to do that.
- Yeah.

1224
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,920
In the meantime, I'll
draw up the papers.

1225
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,200
- All right, sir.
- Okay, George?

1226
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,080
Okay, Mr. Potter.

1227
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,240
No, no, no, no. Wait a
minute here. Wait a minute.

1228
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,360
I don't need twenty-four hours.
I, I don't have to talk to anybody.

1229
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,520
I know right now, and
the answer is no! No!

1230
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,040
Doggone it!

1231
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,640
You sit around here and
you spin your little webs

1232
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,880
and you think the whole world
revolves around you and your money.

1233
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,680
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.

1234
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,840
In the... in the whole vast
configuration of things,

1235
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,920
I'd say you were nothing
but a scurvy little spider.

1236
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:19,680
You... and that goes for you, too.

1237
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,960
And it goes for you, too.

1238
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:36,200
If you wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town.

1239
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,040
Buying your wife a
lot of fine clothes.

1240
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,600
Going to New York on a business
trip a couple of times a year.

1241
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,160
Maybe to Europe once in a while.

1242
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,720
I know what I'm going to do tomorrow

1243
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,040
and the next day and next
year and the hear after that.

1244
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:56,280
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little
town off my feet, and I'm going to see the world

1245
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:59,160
and then I'm going to build things.
I'm going to build air fields.

1246
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:02,080
I'm going to build skyscrapers
a hundred stories high.

1247
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:05,560
I'm going to build
a bridge a mile long.

1248
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,280
What is it you want,

1249
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,160
Mary? What? Y-You want the moon?

1250
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,760
If you do, just say the word,
I'll throw a lasso around it

1251
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,800
and pulls her down for you.

1252
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,280
Buffalo Gals, won't
you come out tonight,

1253
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,320
Won't you come out tonight,
Won't you come out tonight.

1254
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,720
Buffalo Gals, won't
you come out tonight,

1255
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,760
And...

1256
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

1257
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,440
Mary Hatch!

1258
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:46,000
Wh-Why in the world did you
ever marry a guy like me?

1259
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,520
To keep from being an old maid.

1260
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,640
You could have married Sam
Wainwright and anybody else in town.

1261
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:56,040
I didn't want to marry
anybody else in town.

1262
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,240
I want my baby to look like you.

1263
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,160
You didn't even have a honeymoon.

1264
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,000
I promised you... your what?

1265
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,560
My baby.

1266
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:11,920
You... You-You-You-You-You-You-You...
Mary, you're on the nest?

1267
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:14,600
George Bailey lassoes stork.

1268
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,080
Lassoes the stork!

1269
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,840
What do you...

1270
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,840
You mean...
you-you-you...

1271
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,120
What-what-what is
it, a boy or a girl?

1272
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,360
Uh-hm.

1273
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:32,000
Now, you've probably already guessed
that George never leaves Bedford Falls.

1274
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,000
No!

1275
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,120
Mary had her baby, a boy.

1276
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,600
Then she had another one, a girl.

1277
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,920
Day after day she worked away remaking
the old Granville house into a home.

1278
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:47,600
Night after night, George
came back late from the office.

1279
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,440
Potter was bearing down hard.

1280
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,400
Then came a war.

1281
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:05,080
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch
joined the Red Cross and sewed.

1282
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:09,360
Mary had two more babies but
still found time to run the U.S.O.

1283
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:13,360
Sam Wainwright made a fortune
in plastic hoods for planes.

1284
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,160
Potter became head of the draft board.

1285
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:24,240
One-A...
one-A... one-A

1286
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:27,040
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.

1287
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:31,680
Bert the cop was wounded in
North Africa, got the Silver Star.

1288
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:35,520
Ernie, the taxi-driver,
parachuted into France.

1289
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:39,120
Marty helped capture
the Remagen Bridge.

1290
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,640
Harry, Harry Bailey topped them all.

1291
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:46,440
A Navy flier, he shot
down fifteen planes.

1292
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,840
Two of them as they were about to
crash into a transport full of soldiers.

1293
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,960
- Yes, but George...
- George?

1294
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:00,160
Four-F on account of his ear, George
fought the battle of Bedford Falls.

1295
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,080
Hold on, hold on, hold on now.

1296
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,960
Don't you know there's a war on?

1297
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,160
Air raid warden...

1298
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:19,680
paper drives... scrap
drives... rubber drives...

1299
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:24,720
Like everybody else, on
V-E day he wept and prayed.

1300
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,360
On V-J day, he wept and prayed again.

1301
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:32,000
Joseph, now show him
what happened today.

1302
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,280
Yes, sir.

1303
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:38,200
This morning, day before Christmas,
about ten A.M., Bedford Falls Time.

1304
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,760
Hi, Ernie, look at that.

1305
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,080
Gonna snow again.

1306
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,440
What do you mean it's gonna
snow? Look at the headlines.

1307
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,920
I know, I know, George.
And it's marvelous.

1308
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,680
Commander Harry Bailey!

1309
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,320
Mr. Gower, look at this.

1310
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,440
The second page. Now
look, this is for you.

1311
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,240
This is for you. That's for you.

1312
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,920
- Thanks.
- See you again.

1313
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,680
Be sure you spell the name right.

1314
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,600
Hello, Billy, how are you?

1315
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,440
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

1316
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,760
George! George! It's Harry now
on long distance from Washington.

1317
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,800
- Harry! What do you know about that!
- He reversed the charges. It's okay, isn't it?

1318
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,440
Reverse the charges...
of course it's for a hero.

1319
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,920
Harry...

1320
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,920
Oh, you old seven
times of a son of a gun.

1321
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,160
Congratulations!

1322
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,920
How's mother standing it?

1323
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,320
She did?

1324
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,400
What do you know...

1325
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,040
Mother had lunch with
the President's wife.

1326
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,280
Wait till Martha hears about this.

1327
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,120
- What did they have to eat? -
Wha-What did they have to eat?

1328
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:45,960
H-H-Harry, you should see what
they're cooking up in the town for you.

1329
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:46,960
Oh, they are?

1330
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,960
The Navy's going to fly
mother home this afternoon.

1331
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,680
In a plane?

1332
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,680
What? Uncle Billy?

1333
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,760
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
- No, he stopped at the bank first.

1334
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,800
No, he's not here right
now, Harry. But look...

1335
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,680
- George... ...tell me about it.

1336
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,440
...George, tha-that man's here again.

1337
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,160
- What man? -
B-B-Bank... examiner.

1338
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,560
Oh, oh. Uh, uh,

1339
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,840
Harry, talk to Eustace
for a minute, will you?

1340
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,880
I'll be right back. Well...

1341
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,880
- Harry...
- Good morning, sir.

1342
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,160
Carter, bank examiner.

1343
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,600
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1344
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,400
We're all excited around here.

1345
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,440
My brother just got the
Congressional Medal of Honor.

1346
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,920
The president just decorated him.

1347
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,560
Well, I guess they do those things.

1348
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,160
Well, I trust you had a good year.

1349
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,400
Good year?

1350
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,840
Uh, well, between you and
me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.

1351
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,280
Yeah, very funny.

1352
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:33,120
Uh, w-well... Now, come
right in here, Mr. Carter.

1353
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:37,720
Oh, I shouldn't wonder when you okay reverse
charges on personal long distance calls.

1354
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,720
George, shall we hang up?

1355
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,920
No, no. He wants to talk to
Uncle Billy. You just hold on.

1356
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,840
Now, if you'll cooperate, I'd
like to finish with you by tonight.

1357
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,640
I want to spend Christmas
in Elmira with my family.

1358
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,040
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.

1359
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,320
Just step right in
here. We'll fix you up.

1360
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:54,080
December twenty-fourth...

1361
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,200
Eight thousand.

1362
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,320
Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter...

1363
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,760
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter?

1364
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,040
What's the news?

1365
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,800
Oh, well, well, well. Harry
Bailey wins Congressional Medal.

1366
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,920
That couldn't be one
of the Bailey boys?

1367
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,600
You just can't keep those Baileys
down, now can you, Mr. Potter.

1368
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,280
How does slacker
George feel about that?

1369
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,440
Very jealous. Very jealous.

1370
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,760
He only lost three
buttons off his vest.

1371
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,000
Of course, slacker George would have
gotten two of these medals if he had gone.

1372
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,000
Bad ear.

1373
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:34,240
Yes. After all, Potter, some people
like George had to stay at home.

1374
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:38,120
Not every heel was
in Germany and Japan.

1375
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,200
- Oh, good morning, Mr. Bailey.
- Good morning, Horace.

1376
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,120
- I guess you forgot something.
- Huh?

1377
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,160
- You forgot something.
- What?

1378
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,840
- Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
- Oh, sure, sure I am.

1379
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,440
Well, then it's usually customary
to bring the money with you.

1380
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:04,320
Huh? Oh, shucks...

1381
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:08,040
Well, I knew I had...

1382
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:12,000
- How about that finger there?
- Hmm? Well, I...

1383
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,200
Bailey...

1384
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,160
Take me back there. Hurry up.

1385
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,320
Come on, look sharp.

1386
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,360
Take me back.

1387
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,720
Just make yourself at home, Mr.
Carter. I'll get those books for you.

1388
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,200
Oh, hello, Vi.

1389
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,880
George, can I see you for a second?

1390
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,720
Why, of course you can.
Come on in the office here.

1391
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,480
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry.
He's on the telephone.

1392
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,320
Hurry, Uncle Billy, hurry.
Long distance, Washington.

1393
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,520
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.

1394
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,720
Harry, your nephew, remember?

1395
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,160
Here he is. Hurry up.

1396
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,880
Hello... hello.
Y-Y-Yes, Harry.

1397
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,960
Yes... everything...
everything's fine.

1398
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:23,600
I should have my head examined.
Eight thousand dollars.

1399
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,520
It's got to be somewhere.

1400
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,080
Here you are.

1401
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,320
Character?

1402
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,560
If I had any character, I'd...

1403
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,360
It takes a lot of character to leave
your home town and start all over again.

1404
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,720
No, George, don't...

1405
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,640
- Now here, now you're broke, aren't you?
- I know, but...

1406
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:47,520
What do you want to do,
hock your furs and that hat?

1407
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,280
Want to walk to New York?

1408
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,040
You know, they charge for
meals and rent up there

1409
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,680
just the same as they
do in Bedford Falls.

1410
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,600
- Yeah, sure.
- It's a loan.

1411
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,280
That's my business. Building and Loan.

1412
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,320
Besides, you'll get a job.

1413
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,360
Good luck to you.

1414
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,720
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.

1415
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,240
Say hello to New York for me.

1416
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:11,400
Yeah, yeah... sure, I will.

1417
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,240
Now let's hear from
you once in a while.

1418
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,560
Hmm.

1419
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,880
- Merry Christmas, Violet.
- Merry Christmas, George.

1420
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,200
- Mr. Bailey.
- Oh, Mr. Carter,

1421
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,760
I'm sorry. I'll be right with you.

1422
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,400
- Uncle Billy in?
- Yeah, he's in his office.

1423
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,760
Unc... What's going on?

1424
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,560
The bank examiner's here, and I...

1425
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,880
- He's here?
- Yeah, yeah.

1426
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,680
He wants the accounts payable...

1427
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,560
- What's the matter with you?
- Come here.

1428
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,600
- Eustace.
- Yeah?

1429
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,760
Come here a minute.

1430
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,840
Did you see Uncle Billy
with any cash last night?

1431
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,480
He had it on his desk counting
it before he closed up.

1432
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,960
Now look, did you buy anything?

1433
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,440
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
- All right, all right.

1434
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,800
Now, we'll go over every step
you took since you left the house.

1435
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,240
All right. This way.

1436
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:29,240
And did you put the
envelope in your pocket?

1437
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,080
Yeah... maybe, maybe, maybe...

1438
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:33,800
Maybe-Maybe! I don't want any maybe.

1439
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,480
We've got to find that money!

1440
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,040
- I'm no good to you, George. I...
- Uncle Billy, do you...

1441
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:45,360
Listen to me. Do you have
any secret place hiding place?

1442
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,680
Listen to me, listen
to me! Think! Think!

1443
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:57,760
I can't think anymore, George.
I can't think anymore. It hurts...

1444
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,800
Where's that money, you
silly, stupid old fool?!

1445
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:01,920
Where's that money?

1446
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,680
Do you realize what this means?

1447
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:06,880
It means bankruptcy
and scandal, and prison!

1448
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,120
That's what it means.

1449
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,760
One of us is going to jail!

1450
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,360
Well, it's not gonna be me.

1451
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,360
Hello, darling.

1452
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,120
Hello daddy, hello daddy.

1453
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,360
How do you like it?
We're going to put...

1454
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,280
Bless you!

1455
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:44,680
Did you bring the wreath?

1456
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,680
- Yes, Daddy, did you bring the Christmas wreath?
- What wreath?

1457
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,280
Oh, that's the Merry Christmas
Wreath for the window.

1458
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,800
No. I left it at the office.

1459
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,880
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, just started.

1460
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,480
- Where's your coat and hat?
- Left them at the office.

1461
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,400
- What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter. Everything's all right.

1462
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,640
Go on, Pete, you're a big boy.

1463
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:11,880
You can put the star up.

1464
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,920
Way up at the top.

1465
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,440
That's it.

1466
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,840
All right.

1467
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,600
Fill in that little
bare spot right there.

1468
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,880
That's it.

1469
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,880
Isn't it wonderful about Harry?

1470
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,200
We're famous, George.

1471
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:29,280
I'll bet I had fifty calls today
about the parade, the banquet.

1472
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,600
Your mother's so excited, she...

1473
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,400
Must she keep playing that?

1474
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,160
I have to practice it for
the party tonight, Daddy.

1475
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:00,480
Mommy says we can stay up till
midnight and sing Christmas carols.

1476
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,800
Can you sing, Daddy?

1477
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,200
Better hurry and shave.

1478
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,800
The families will be here soon.

1479
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,320
Families! I... I don't
want the families over here.

1480
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:14,720
Come on out in the kitchen
with me while I finish dinner.

1481
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,960
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1482
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,120
Have a hectic day?

1483
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:23,160
Oh, yeah. Another big
red-letter day for the Bailey's.

1484
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,840
Daddy, the Brown's next door
have a new car. You should see it.

1485
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,480
Well, what's the matter with our
car? Isn't it good enough for you?

1486
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,760
Yes, Daddy.

1487
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,720
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1488
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,640
Excuse you for what?

1489
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,000
I burped!

1490
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,240
All right, darling, you're excused.

1491
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,720
Now go upstairs and see
what little Zuzu wants.

1492
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,680
Zuzu. W-What's the matter with Zuzu?

1493
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:44,560
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed.

1494
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,280
Caught it coming home from school.

1495
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:47,880
They gave her a flower for a prize

1496
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:50,280
and she didn't want to crush it
so she didn't button up her coat.

1497
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,960
- What is it, a sore throat or what?
- Just a cold.

1498
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,840
- The doctor says it's nothing serious.
- The doctor?

1499
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,600
- Was the doctor here?
- Yes, I called him right away.

1500
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,400
- He says it's nothing to worry about.
- Is she running a temperature?

1501
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,760
- What is it? - Just a
teensy one, ninety-nine, six.

1502
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,000
- She'll be all right.
- Gosh, it's this old house.

1503
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,360
I don't... I don't know why
we don't all have pneumonia.

1504
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:09,080
This drafty old barn! Might as
well be living in a refrigerator.

1505
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:13,880
Why did we have to live here in the first place
and stay around this measly, crummy old town?

1506
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:15,960
George, what's wrong?

1507
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,320
Wrong? Everything's wrong.

1508
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,560
You call this a happy family?

1509
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,480
Why did we have to
have all these kids?

1510
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,560
Dad, how do you spell 'frankincense'?

1511
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,520
I don't know. Why, ask your mother.

1512
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,600
- Where're you going?
- Going up to see Zuzu.

1513
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,720
He told me to write
a play for tomorrow.

1514
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:43,680
F-R-A-N-K-l-N...

1515
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:45,120
Hi, Daddy.

1516
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:48,920
- Well, what happened to you?
- I won a flower.

1517
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,600
Wait now. W-Where do
you think you're going?

1518
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,200
Want to give my flower a drink.

1519
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,760
All right, all right,
here, give Daddy the flower.

1520
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,440
I'll give it a drink. All right, here.

1521
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:05,000
- Look, Daddy... paste it.
- Yeah, all right...

1522
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,880
Now, I'll paste this together.

1523
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:19,880
Now, there it is, good as new.
All right, give the flower a drink.

1524
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,240
- Now, will you do something for me?
- What?

1525
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:24,240
Will you try to get some sleep?

1526
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:27,080
I'm not sleepy. I want
to look at my flower.

1527
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,840
I know, I know, but
you just go to sleep

1528
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:34,360
and then you can dream about
it, and it'll be a whole garden.

1529
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,520
- It will?
- Uh-huh.

1530
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,120
- Telephone!
- I'll get it.

1531
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,200
Hello.

1532
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,520
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

1533
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,680
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch.
I'm sure she'll be all right.

1534
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:59,480
The doctor says that she ought to be out
of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner.

1535
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,160
- Is that Zuzu's teacher?
- Yes.

1536
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,520
Let me speak to her.

1537
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,480
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?

1538
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,600
This is George Bailey.
I'm Zuzu's father.

1539
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,640
Say, what kind of a
teacher are you anyway?

1540
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:12,040
What do you mean sending her
home like that, half naked?

1541
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,240
Do you realize she'll probably end
up with pneumonia on account of you?

1542
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,680
- George!
- Is this the sort of thing

1543
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,720
we pay taxes for
- to have teachers... to have teachers like you?

1544
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:22,280
Stupid, silly, careless people who send
our kids home without any clothes on?

1545
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,280
You know, maybe my kids
aren't the best-dressed kids,

1546
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,080
and maybe they don't
have any decent clothes...

1547
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,160
Aw, that stupid...

1548
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:31,680
He-Hello, Mrs. Welch.
L-l-I want to apologize.

1549
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,480
Hel-lo... hello...

1550
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,080
- She's hung up. -
L-l-I'll hang her up.

1551
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:40,080
Now, who do you think you are?

1552
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:41,240
What is that?

1553
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,080
Hello? Who is this?

1554
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,040
Oh, Mr. Welch?

1555
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:46,480
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.

1556
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,720
Gives me a chance to tell you
what I really think of your wife.

1557
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,720
- George...
- Will you get out and let me handle this?

1558
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,200
Hello?

1559
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:57,560
Hello? What? Oh, you will, huh?

1560
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,640
Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time
you think you're man enough.

1561
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:04,360
Hello... any...

1562
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,840
Oh...

1563
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,280
Daddy, how do you spell "Hallelujah?"

1564
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,280
How should I know? What do
you think I am, a dictionary?

1565
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,800
Tommy, stop that! Stop it!

1566
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:14,040
Janie, haven't you leaned that silly tune
yet? You've played it over and over again.

1567
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,760
Now stop it! Stop it!

1568
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,440
I'm sorry, Mary.

1569
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,000
Janie, I'm sorry.

1570
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,280
I didn't mean...

1571
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:55,920
You go on and practice.

1572
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:04,600
Pete, I owe you an apology, too.

1573
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,080
I'm sorry.

1574
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,760
What do you want to know?

1575
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,120
Nothing, Daddy.

1576
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,720
What's the matter with everybody?

1577
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:21,160
Janie, go on. I told you to practice.

1578
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,520
- Now, go on, play.
- Oh, Daddy...

1579
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:29,840
George, why must you
torture the children?

1580
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,120
Why don't you...

1581
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,680
Mary...

1582
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,600
Bedford
two-four-seven, please.

1583
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,760
- Is Daddy in trouble?
- Yes, Pete.

1584
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:55,040
- Shall I pray for him?
- Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

1585
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:58,040
- Me, too?
- You, too, Tommy.

1586
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,560
Hello, Uncle Billy?

1587
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,120
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.

1588
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,360
I need help.

1589
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,280
Through some sort of an accident my
company's short in their accounts.

1590
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,240
The bank examiner's got there today.

1591
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:12,440
I've got to raise eight
thousand dollars immediately.

1592
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:15,080
Oh, so that's what the reporters
wanted to talk to you about?

1593
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,400
- The reporters?
- Yes,

1594
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:20,120
they called me up from
your Building and Loan.

1595
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:23,760
Oh, there's a man over there
from the D.A.'s office, too.

1596
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:24,920
He's looking for you.

1597
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,800
Please help me, Mr. Potter.

1598
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:28,600
Help me, won't you, please?

1599
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:30,480
Can't you see what
it means to my family?

1600
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:33,480
I'll pay any sort of a bonus
on the loan, any interest

1601
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,160
if you still want the
Building and Loan. I'm...

1602
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,840
George, could it possibly be there's
a slight discrepancy in the books?

1603
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,320
No, sir. There's nothing
wrong with the books.

1604
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,760
I've just misplaced
eight thousand dollars.

1605
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,440
I can't find it anywhere.

1606
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,720
You misplaced eight thousand dollars?

1607
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:47,800
Yes, sir.

1608
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,320
Have you notified the police?

1609
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,200
No, sir. L-I didn't
want the publicity.

1610
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:56,320
Harry's homecoming tomorrow...

1611
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:58,560
They're gonna believe that one.

1612
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,720
What've you been doing, George?

1613
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,440
Playing the market with
the company's money?

1614
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:04,120
No, sir, no, sir. I haven't.

1615
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,680
What is it, a woman then?

1616
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:09,800
You know, it's all over town that
you've been giving money to Violet Bick.

1617
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,160
- What!
- Not that it makes any difference to me,

1618
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,360
but why did you come to me?

1619
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:16,160
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright
and ask him for the money?

1620
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:17,800
I can't get ahold of
him. He's in Europe.

1621
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,320
Well, what about all
your other friends?

1622
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,120
They don't have that
kind of money, Mr. Potter.

1623
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,600
You know that. You're the only
one in town that can help me.

1624
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,440
I see.

1625
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:29,040
I've suddenly become quite important.

1626
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:31,960
Wha-What kind of security
would I have, George?

1627
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:35,200
- Have you got any stocks?
- No, sir.

1628
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:38,120
Bonds? Real estate?
Collateral of any kind?

1629
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:42,960
I have some life insurance, a
fifteen thousand dollar policy.

1630
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,200
Yes... how much is your equity in it?

1631
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:49,040
- Five hundred dollars.
- Five hundred dollars!

1632
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:53,320
And you ask me to lend
you eight thousand.

1633
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:54,400
Look at you.

1634
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:56,640
You used to be so cocky!

1635
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:01,240
You were going to go out
and conquer the world.

1636
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:05,520
You once called me a
warped, frustrated old man.

1637
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:09,680
What are you but a warped
frustrated young man?

1638
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:15,160
A miserable little clerk crawling in here
on your hands and knees and begging for help.

1639
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,200
No securities, no stocks, no bonds,

1640
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:23,920
nothing but a miserable little five hundred
dollar equity in a life insurance policy.

1641
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,760
You're worth more dead than alive.

1642
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:30,000
Why don't you go to the
riff-raff you love so much

1643
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:32,920
ask them to let you
have eight thousand?

1644
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,080
You know why?

1645
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:36,840
Because they'd run you
out of town on a rail.

1646
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,200
But I tell you what I'm
going to do for you, George.

1647
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:43,200
Since the state
examiner is still here,

1648
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:46,040
as a stock holder of
the Building and Loan,

1649
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:49,440
I'm going to swear out a
warrant for your arrest.

1650
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:54,160
Misappropriation of funds,
manipulation, malfeasance...

1651
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,520
All right, George, go ahead, George.

1652
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:00,680
You can't hide in a
little town like this.

1653
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,120
Bill? This is Potter.

1654
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,800
Joe! Merry Christmas!

1655
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,480
- Glad you come.
- Thank you.

1656
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:23,280
- How about some of that good spaghetti?
- We got everything.

1657
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:36,720
God...

1658
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:40,960
Oh, God...

1659
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,720
Dear Father in Heaven,

1660
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:55,000
I'm not a praying man,
but if you're up there,

1661
01:35:55,040 --> 01:36:00,680
and you can hear me, show me the way.

1662
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:04,840
I'm at the end of my rope. I...

1663
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,520
Show me the way, God.

1664
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,640
Are you all right, George?

1665
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:15,280
Want someone to take you home?

1666
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,440
Why you drink so much, my friend?

1667
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:24,360
Please go home, Mr. Bailey.
This is Christmas Eve.

1668
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:27,080
Bailey? Which Bailey?

1669
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:29,800
This is Mr. George Bailey.

1670
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,680
And the next time you talk to my
wife like that, you'll get worse.

1671
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:38,160
She cried for an hour.

1672
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,400
It isn't enough she slaves
teaching your stupid kids

1673
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:42,600
how to read and write, and
you have to bawl her out, eh.

1674
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:43,800
You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

1675
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,320
Now wait. I want to pay for my drink.

1676
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,880
Never mind the money.
You get out of here quick.

1677
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:50,440
- All right.
- You hit my best friend. Get out!

1678
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:57,480
You all right, George?

1679
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:58,560
Who was that?

1680
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:00,760
He gone. No worry.

1681
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:03,440
His name is Welch. He no
come in to my place no more.

1682
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:06,680
Oh, Welch. That's
what I get for praying.

1683
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:08,760
The last time he come in
here. You hear that, Nick?

1684
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:09,920
Yes, you bet.

1685
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,600
Where's my insurance policy? Oh, here.

1686
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:15,520
- Oh, no, please, no go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
- I'm all right.

1687
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:18,080
No, no, you no feel so
good. Sit down and rest.

1688
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,560
- I'm all right.
- Please no go away. Please!

1689
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:40,440
What do you think you're doing?

1690
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:44,960
Now look what you did.

1691
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,320
My great-grandfather
planted this tree.

1692
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:50,320
Hey, you! Hey, you!

1693
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,760
Come back here, you drunken fool!

1694
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:54,600
Get this car out of here!

1695
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:04,920
Hey, what's the matter with
you? Look where you're going!

1696
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:54,560
Help!

1697
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:00,360
Help! Help! Help!

1698
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:04,680
Help! Help!

1699
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:08,680
Help!

1700
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:15,280
Help! Help! Help! Help!

1701
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,840
Help!

1702
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:24,080
Help! Help! Help!

1703
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,680
I didn't have time to get
some stylish underwear.

1704
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:45,160
My wife gave me this
on my last birthday.

1705
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:48,040
I passed away in it.

1706
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:54,240
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.

1707
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,400
You should read the new book
Mark Twain's writing now.

1708
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:03,560
How did you happen to fall in?

1709
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,120
I didn't fall in. I
jumped in to save George.

1710
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:10,160
You what? To... to save me?

1711
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:13,400
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't
go through with it, did you?

1712
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:15,560
- Go through with what?
- Suicide.

1713
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:18,800
Well, it's against the law
to commit suicide around here.

1714
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,680
Yeah, it's against the
law where I come from, too.

1715
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:24,480
- Where do you come from?
- Heaven.

1716
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:32,000
I had to act quickly.
That's why I jumped in.

1717
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:34,960
I knew if I were drowning
you'd try to save me.

1718
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,920
And you see, you did, and
that's how I saved you.

1719
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,040
Very funny.

1720
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,120
Your lip's bleeding, George.

1721
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:46,440
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in
answer to a prayer a little bit ago.

1722
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:50,320
Oh, no, no, no, George, I'm
the answer to your prayer.

1723
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,360
That's why I was sent down here.

1724
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,640
How do you know my name?

1725
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:58,280
Oh, I know all about you. I've
watched you grow up from a little boy.

1726
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:02,040
- What are you, a mind reader or something?
- Oh, no.

1727
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,760
- Well, who are you then?
- Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.

1728
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:10,440
Odbody... A-S-2.
Wh-Wh-What's that A-S-2?

1729
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:12,000
Angel Second Class.

1730
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,360
Cheerio, my good man.

1731
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,000
Oh, brother...

1732
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,920
I wonder what Martini
put in those drinks?

1733
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,760
Hey, what's... with you...

1734
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,280
wh-wh-what-did you
say just a minute ago?

1735
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,920
Why'd you want to save me?

1736
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:50,080
That's what I was sent down
for. I'm your guardian angel.

1737
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,160
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

1738
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:55,280
Ridiculous of you to think
of killing yourself for money.

1739
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:58,080
- Eight thousand dollars.
- Yeah, I'll say. Just things like that.

1740
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,760
Now how do you know that?

1741
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:01,640
I told you. I'm your guardian angel.

1742
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,440
I know everything about you.

1743
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,000
Well, you look about like
the kind of an angel I'd get.

1744
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:09,880
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you?

1745
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,000
What happened to your wings?

1746
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:14,680
I haven't won my wings yet. That's
why I'm an angel second class.

1747
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:22,880
I don't know whether I like it very much being
seen around with an angel without any wings.

1748
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:26,640
Oh, l-I've got to earn them
and you'll help me, won't you?

1749
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:31,480
- Sure, sure. How?
- By letting me help you.

1750
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:34,160
Only one way you can help me.

1751
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,280
Y-You don't happen to have
eight thousand bucks on you?

1752
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,880
Oh, no, no. We don't
use money in heaven.

1753
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:41,520
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting.

1754
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:44,080
Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.

1755
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:46,800
Oh, tut, tut, tut.

1756
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,240
I found it out a little late.

1757
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,520
I'm worth more dead than alive.

1758
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:55,800
Now look, you mustn't talk like that.
I won't get my wings with that attitude.

1759
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:58,360
You just don't know
all that you've done.

1760
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,480
If it hadn't been for you...

1761
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:02,440
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me,
everybody'd be a lot better off.

1762
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,480
My wife, and my kids, and my friends.

1763
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:07,840
And my... Look, little fellow, why, you
go off and haunt somebody else, will you?

1764
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:10,600
No, no, you don't
understand. I've got my job.

1765
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:12,440
Aw, shut up, will you?

1766
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:19,680
Hmmm, this isn't gonna be so easy.

1767
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:28,960
Yeah! So you still think killing yourself
would make everyone feel happier, eh?

1768
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,800
Oh, I don't know. I
guess you're right.

1769
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:37,520
I suppose it would have been better
if I'd never been born at all.

1770
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:40,960
- What'd you say?
- I said I wish I'd never been born.

1771
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,880
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.

1772
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,160
You...

1773
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:47,360
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1774
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,480
That's an idea.

1775
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:54,280
What do you think?
Yeah, that'll do it.

1776
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:55,400
All right.

1777
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:00,120
You've got your wish.

1778
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,880
You've never been born.

1779
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,360
You don't have to make
all that fuss about it.

1780
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:12,480
What did you say?

1781
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:15,120
You've never been
born. You don't exist.

1782
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:16,360
You haven't a care in the world.

1783
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:19,920
No worries, no obligations, no
eight thousand dollars to get,

1784
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:21,720
no Potter looking for
you with the sheriff.

1785
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,600
- Say something else in that ear.
- Sure. You can hear out of it.

1786
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:27,640
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.

1787
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:30,160
I haven't heard anything out
of that ear since I was a kid.

1788
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,400
Must have been that
jump in that cold water.

1789
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,640
Your lip's stopped
bleeding, too, George.

1790
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:41,480
What do you know about that?

1791
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:43,720
What's happened?

1792
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,480
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it?

1793
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:49,960
Well, I, uh... What's happened here?

1794
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,800
What I need is a couple
of good stiff drinks.

1795
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,840
How about you, angel,
you want a drink?

1796
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:57,920
Come on, soon as these
clothes of ours are dry...

1797
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:00,120
Those are dry.

1798
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,640
What do you know about that?

1799
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:03,040
Stove's hotter than I thought.

1800
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:06,520
Now, come on, get your clothes on, and
we'll stroll up to my car and get...

1801
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,960
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll, you fly.

1802
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,360
I can't fly. I haven't got my wings.

1803
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:13,240
You haven't got your
wings. Yeah, that's right.

1804
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,040
What's the matter?

1805
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:23,960
Well, this is where I left
my car and it isn't here.

1806
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,160
You have no car.

1807
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:29,000
Well, I had a car and it was right
here. I guess somebody moved it.

1808
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,680
- Good evening.
- Oh, say... Hey...

1809
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:33,320
wh-where's my car.

1810
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,320
- I beg your pardon?
- My car, my car.

1811
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,840
I'm the fellow that owns the
car that ran into your tree.

1812
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,880
What tree? What do
you mean, what tree?

1813
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,080
This tree. Here. I ran into it.

1814
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:46,000
Cut a big gash in
the side of it there.

1815
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:52,040
You must mean two other trees.

1816
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:53,200
You had me worried.

1817
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,840
One of the oldest
trees in Pottersville.

1818
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:58,400
Pottersville. Why,
you mean Bedford Falls.

1819
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:00,200
I mean Pottersville.

1820
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:02,200
Don't you think I know where I live?

1821
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:03,480
What's the matter with you?

1822
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:13,440
Oh, I don't know. Either
I'm off my nut, or he is.

1823
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:14,640
...or you are.

1824
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:16,840
It isn't me!

1825
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:20,480
Well, maybe I left the car up at
Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.

1826
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,720
- Clarence!
- Clarence! Clarence!

1827
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,880
That's all right. Go on in.

1828
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:32,920
Martini is a friend of mine.

1829
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,880
There's a place to sit down, sit down.

1830
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:44,200
Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?

1831
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:46,400
- You want a Martini?
- No, no, Martini.

1832
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:48,800
- Your boss. Where is he?
- Look, I'm the boss.

1833
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:50,040
You want a drink or don't you?

1834
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,440
Okay, all right. Double
bourbon, will you? Quick, huh.

1835
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:53,640
Okay.

1836
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,360
What's yours?

1837
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:59,960
I was just thinking.

1838
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:03,680
Uh... It's been so long since I...

1839
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:07,280
Look, Mister, I'm standing here
waiting for you to make up your mind.

1840
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:08,840
That's a good man.

1841
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:15,560
I was just thinking, uh,
of a flaming rum punch.

1842
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,120
No, it's not cold enough for
that. Not nearly cold enough.

1843
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:19,360
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1844
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,240
I got it.

1845
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:24,920
Mulled wine, heavy on the
cinnamon and light on the cloves.

1846
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:26,800
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!

1847
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:31,760
Hey, look, Mister, we serve hard drinks
in here for men who want to get drunk fast.

1848
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:36,640
And we don't need any characters around to
give the joint atmosphere. Is that clear?

1849
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:39,320
Or do I have to slip you
my left for a convincer?

1850
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:40,440
What's he talking about?

1851
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:45,960
Nick, Nick, just give him
the same as mine. He's okay.

1852
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,160
Okay.

1853
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:49,960
What's the matter with him?

1854
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,120
I never saw Nick act like that before.

1855
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:55,600
You'll see a lot of
strange things from now on.

1856
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:57,040
Oh, yeah.

1857
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:03,720
Hey, li-li-little
fellow, you worry me.

1858
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:07,240
- You know, y-y-you got
someplace to sleep? - No.

1859
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:08,840
You don't, huh?

1860
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:11,480
- Well, y-y-you
got any money? - No.

1861
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:14,040
No wonder you jumped in the river.

1862
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:17,680
I jumped in the river to save
you so I could get my wings.

1863
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:19,720
- Oh, that's
right. - Oh-oh.

1864
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:23,760
- Somebody's just made it.
- Made what?

1865
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:28,320
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means
that some angel's just got his wings.

1866
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:40,960
Look, I think maybe you better not
mention getting your wings around here.

1867
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:44,080
Why? Don't they believe in angels?

1868
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:47,080
A... Yeah, they believe in angels.

1869
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:50,000
Oh, oh! Why should they be
surprised when they see one?

1870
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:56,440
Aw, he never grew up. He's...

1871
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,360
How old are you, anyway, Clarence?

1872
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:03,680
Two hundred and
ninety-three, uh, next May.

1873
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:05,760
That does it!

1874
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:09,240
Out you two pixies go, through
the door or out the window.

1875
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:10,400
Look, Nick, what's wrong?

1876
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:13,440
And that's another thing. Where
do you come off calling me Nick?

1877
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:14,920
Well, Nick, that's your name.

1878
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:19,240
What's that got to do with it? I
don't know you from Adam's off ox.

1879
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:21,840
Hey! Hey, you, rummy
there! Come here! Come here!

1880
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:28,760
Didn't I tell you never to come
panhandling around here, huh?

1881
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,720
Mr. Gower!

1882
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,120
Mr. Gower!

1883
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,920
What... what is he...

1884
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:46,400
Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey!

1885
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:50,960
- Don't you know me?
- No. No.

1886
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:54,240
Throw 'em out. Throw 'em out!

1887
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:57,400
Mr. Gower... Hey, what is...

1888
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,680
Hey, Nick, Nick... Isn't
that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

1889
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,920
You know, that's another
reason for me not to like you.

1890
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:05,480
That rum head spent twenty years
in jail for poisoning a kid.

1891
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,080
If you know him, you must
be a jailbird yourself.

1892
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:10,640
Uh, would you show these
gentlemen to the door?

1893
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:12,600
Sure. This way, gentlemen.

1894
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,240
Stay out! Stay out!

1895
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:21,480
Hey! Get me!

1896
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,440
I'm giving out wings!

1897
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:27,520
You see, George, you were not there

1898
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:30,080
to stop Gower from putting
that poison into the capsule...

1899
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:33,080
What do you mean I wasn't there?

1900
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:36,000
I remember distinctly. What the...

1901
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:38,800
hey, what's going on around here?

1902
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:43,560
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.

1903
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:51,680
Look, who are you?

1904
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:54,360
I told you, George.
I'm your guardian angel.

1905
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:56,040
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.

1906
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:04,400
What else are you? What are you?

1907
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:06,520
- You are hypnotist?
- No, of course not.

1908
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:09,440
Well, then why am I seeing
all these strange things?

1909
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:11,680
Don't you understand, George?

1910
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:13,680
It's because you were not born.

1911
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:15,560
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?

1912
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:18,400
You're nobody. You have no identity.

1913
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:20,880
Oh, what do you mean, no
identity? My name's George Bailey.

1914
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:22,920
There is no George Bailey.

1915
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:32,720
You have no papers, no cards, no driver's
license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy.

1916
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,520
They're not there, either.

1917
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:38,840
- What?
- Zuzu's petals.

1918
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:46,600
You've been given a
great gift, George...

1919
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:50,080
a chance to see what the world
would be like without you.

1920
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:55,480
Now wait a minute here.
Wait a minute here.

1921
01:51:57,160 --> 01:52:00,560
Aw, this is some sort of a
funny dream I'm having here.

1922
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:02,400
So long, Mister, l-I'm going home.

1923
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:05,040
- Home? What home?
- Now shut up! Cut it out!

1924
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:08,760
You're... You're... You're
crazy. That's what I think.

1925
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:11,680
You're... You're screwy and
you're driving me crazy, too!

1926
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:13,040
I'm seeing things here.

1927
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:15,080
I'm going home and
see my wife and family.

1928
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:17,480
You understand that?
And I'm going home alone!

1929
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:24,240
How am I doing, Joseph? Thanks.

1930
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,560
No, I didn't have a drink!

1931
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:19,120
Hey, hey.

1932
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:21,680
- Where did the Building and Loan move to?
- The building and what?

1933
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,400
The Bailey Building and
Loan. It was up there.

1934
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:25,600
They went out of business years ago.

1935
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:27,320
That guy is a liar!

1936
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,360
I know everything's shot in this town.

1937
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:33,480
- I know...
- Hey, Violet.

1938
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:37,480
Hey, listen, that's Violet Bick!

1939
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:39,640
- I know. I know.
- I know that girl.

1940
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:41,200
Take a walk. Beat it.

1941
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,400
Hey, Ernie, Ernie...

1942
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:49,240
Ernie, take me home.
I've gone off my nut!

1943
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:50,880
- Where do you live?
- Aw, now, doggone it,

1944
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,680
Ernie, don't you start
pulling that stuff.

1945
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:54,880
You know where I live.
Three-twenty Sycamore.

1946
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:56,920
- Now hurry up. - Okay.
Three-twenty Sycamore?

1947
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,120
- Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
- All right. All right.

1948
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,200
Look here, Ernie,
straighten me out here.

1949
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,960
Look, l-I've got some
bad liquor or something.

1950
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,400
I want you to listen to me.
Now, you are Ernie Bishop,

1951
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:10,400
and you live in Bailey Park with your
wife and kid? That's right, isn't it?

1952
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:11,440
You seen my wife?

1953
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:14,960
Seen your wife! I've been to
your house a hundred times.

1954
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,200
Look, bud, what's the idea?

1955
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:19,920
I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife
ran away three years ago and took the kid...

1956
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:22,520
And I ain't never seen
you before in my life, see?

1957
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:25,000
Okay. Just step on
it. Just get me home.

1958
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:45,080
- Is this the place?
- Of course, it's the place.

1959
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:47,880
Well, this house ain't been
lived in for twenty years.

1960
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:55,560
What's up, Ernie?

1961
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:58,000
I don't know, but we'd better
keep our eye on this guy.

1962
01:54:58,040 --> 01:54:59,000
He's bats.

1963
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:19,560
Mary! Mary!

1964
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:25,600
Tommy! Pete! Janie!
Zuzu! Where are you?

1965
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:27,760
They're not here, George.
You have no children.

1966
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:29,960
Where are they? What
have you done with them?

1967
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,120
All right, put up your
hands. No fast moves.

1968
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:33,760
Come on out here, both of you.

1969
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,320
Bert! Thank heaven, you're here.

1970
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:38,040
- Stand back!
- Bert, what's happened to this house?

1971
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:39,560
Wh-Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

1972
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:40,600
Watch him, Bert.

1973
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:42,040
- Come on, come on.
- Bert, Ernie!

1974
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:43,400
What's the matter with you two guys?

1975
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:45,120
You-You-You were here
on my wedding night.

1976
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:48,160
You, both of you, stood out there on the
porch and sung to us, don't you remember?

1977
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:49,240
- Think I'd better be going.
- Look,

1978
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,320
now why don't you be a good kid
and we'll take you into a doctor.

1979
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:53,360
- Everything's gonna be all right. Now...
- Bert, now listen to me.

1980
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:55,600
Ernie, will you take me
over to my mother's house?

1981
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:57,120
Bert! Listen! It's that fellow there.

1982
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:59,400
He says he's an angel.
He's tried to hypnotize me.

1983
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:01,440
I hate to do this, fella, but...

1984
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:04,880
Run, George! Run, George!

1985
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:08,640
Help! Joseph, help!

1986
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:13,400
- Oh, shut up!
- Help, oh, Joseph, Joseph!

1987
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:21,960
Where'd he go? Where'd he
go? I had him right here.

1988
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:26,160
I need a drink.

1989
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:29,200
Well, which way'd they
go? Help me find 'em.

1990
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:40,960
Well?

1991
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:45,200
Mother.

1992
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:49,280
Mother? What do you want?

1993
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:55,240
Mother, this is, this is George.
I... I thought sure you'd remember me.

1994
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:56,760
George who?

1995
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:58,320
If you're looking for a
room, there's no vacancy.

1996
01:56:58,360 --> 01:57:00,040
Oh, Mother, listen. Please help me.

1997
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:01,680
Something terrible's happened to me.

1998
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:04,520
L-l-I don't know what it is.
Something's happened to everybody.

1999
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,120
Please let me come in.

2000
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:08,560
- Keep me here until I get over it.
- Get over what?

2001
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:12,040
I don't take in strangers unless
they're sent here by somebody I know.

2002
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:15,760
What? Look, I know everybody you know.

2003
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:18,000
What do you... Your
brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

2004
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:19,800
- You know him?
- Well, sure I do.

2005
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:22,120
- When'd you see him last?
- Today over at his house.

2006
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:23,200
That's a lie.

2007
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:26,240
He's been in the insane asylum
ever since he lost his business.

2008
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:28,120
And if you ask me,
that's where you belong.

2009
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,120
Strange, isn't it?

2010
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:46,560
Each man's life touches
so many other lives

2011
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:49,560
and when he isn't around he
leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?

2012
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:50,720
I've heard of things like this.

2013
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:52,840
You've got me in some kind
of a spell, or something.

2014
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:54,920
Well, I'm going to get out
of it. I'll get out of it.

2015
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:56,920
I know how, too. I...

2016
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:00,560
The last man I talked to before all this
stuff started happening to me was Martini.

2017
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:01,480
You know where he lives?

2018
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:03,760
Sure I know where he lives.
He lives in Bailey Park.

2019
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:11,080
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?

2020
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:13,600
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore.

2021
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:16,040
All I know is this
should be Bailey Park.

2022
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:18,960
But where are the houses?

2023
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,680
You weren't here to build them.

2024
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,480
Your brother, Harry Bailey,

2025
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:30,640
broke through the ice and was
drowned at the age of nine.

2026
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:32,440
That's a lie. Harry
Bailey went to war!

2027
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:34,120
He got the Congressional
Medal of Honor!

2028
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:36,320
He saved the lives of
every man on that transport.

2029
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:38,440
Every man on that transport died.

2030
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:42,360
Harry wasn't there to save them,
because you weren't there to save Harry.

2031
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:57,840
You see, George, you
really had a wonderful life.

2032
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:02,240
Don't you see what a mistake
it would be to throw it away?

2033
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:05,480
- Clarence...
- Yes, George?

2034
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:08,840
- Where's Mary?
- Oh, well, I... I... I can't do...

2035
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,160
I don't know how you
know these things,

2036
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:11,360
- but tell me, where is she?
- I...

2037
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:13,400
If you know where she is,
tell me where my wife is.

2038
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:14,600
I'm not supposed to tell.

2039
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:16,480
Please, Clarence,
tell me where she is.

2040
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:18,880
- You're not going to like it, George.
- Where is she?

2041
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:21,280
She's an old maid. She never married.

2042
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:22,600
Where's Mary, where is she?

2043
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:23,800
- She is...
- Where is she?

2044
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:26,800
She's just about to
close up the library!

2045
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:34,240
Aw, there must be some easier
way for me to get my wings.

2046
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:46,680
Mary!

2047
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:53,320
Mary!

2048
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:58,600
Mary, Mary, Mary...

2049
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:01,200
Mary, it's George.

2050
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:02,680
Don't you know me?
What's happened to us?

2051
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:05,040
- I don't know you, let me go!
- Mary, please!

2052
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:07,320
Oh, don't do this to me.
Please, Mary, help me.

2053
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:09,320
Where's our kids? I need you, Mary!

2054
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:13,080
Help me, Mary! Mary...

2055
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:14,160
Let me go!

2056
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:19,880
- Mary, don't run away!
- That man, stop him!

2057
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:21,720
Tom! Ed!

2058
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:24,560
Charlie! That's my wife!

2059
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:28,600
- Mary!
- Oh, no, you don't!

2060
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:31,160
- Somebody call the police!
- Hit him with a bottle!

2061
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:33,160
He needs a straight jacket.

2062
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:35,560
Mary! Clarence!

2063
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:37,840
Get out of here!

2064
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:41,960
- Clarence!
- Where are you?

2065
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:43,360
Oh, it's you!

2066
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:47,920
Stand back!

2067
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:03,240
Clarence!

2068
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:10,880
Clarence! Clarence!

2069
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:13,440
Help me, Clarence.

2070
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:16,040
Get me back.

2071
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:19,400
Get me back. I don't
care what happens to me.

2072
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:22,440
Get me back to my wife and kids.

2073
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,440
Help me, Clarence, please.

2074
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:28,960
Please! I want to live again.

2075
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,520
I want to live again.

2076
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,560
I want to live again.

2077
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:36,240
Please, God, let me live again.

2078
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,040
Hey, George.

2079
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,000
George!

2080
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:52,080
You all right. Hey, what's the matter?

2081
02:01:52,120 --> 02:01:54,560
Now get out of here, Bert or
I'll hit you again! Get out!

2082
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:56,480
What the Sam Hill you,
you yelling for, George!

2083
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:01,040
You... George?

2084
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:02,480
Bert, do you know me?

2085
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:04,520
Know you? Hum, are you kidding'?

2086
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:06,760
I've been looking all over
town, trying to find you.

2087
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:09,840
I saw your car piled into that tree
down there, and I thought maybe you...

2088
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:12,200
Hey, your mouth's bleeding.
Are you sure you're all right?

2089
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:13,360
What did you...

2090
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:21,040
My mouth's bleeding,
Bert! My mouth's bleed...

2091
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:24,160
Zuzu's petals,
Zuzu's... There they are!

2092
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:27,080
Bert! What do you know about that?

2093
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:29,520
Merry Christmas!

2094
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:31,400
Well, Merry Christmas!

2095
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:32,480
Mary!

2096
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:34,680
Mary!

2097
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:38,280
Yaa!

2098
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:43,200
Yaa!

2099
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:45,640
Hello, Bedford Falls!

2100
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:51,400
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

2101
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:53,400
Merry Christmas, George!

2102
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:56,640
Merry Christmas, movie house!

2103
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:59,800
Merry Christmas, Emporium!

2104
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:03,840
Merry Christmas, you wonderful
old Building and Loan!

2105
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,120
Hey! Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!

2106
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:13,840
Happy New Year to you... in jail.

2107
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:16,520
Go on home. They're waiting for you.

2108
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:19,200
Mary!

2109
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:20,840
Mary!

2110
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:23,840
Mary!

2111
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:27,640
Well, hello, Mr. Bank
Examiner. How are you?

2112
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:29,960
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit.
- I know. Eight thousand dollars.

2113
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,200
George, I've got a little paper here.

2114
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:33,400
I'll bet it's a warrant for
my arrest. Isn't it wonderful?

2115
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:34,400
I'm going to jail.

2116
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:35,640
Merry Christmas! Reporters?

2117
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:36,920
Wh-Where's Mary?

2118
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:39,880
Mary! Oh, look at this
wonderful old drafty house.

2119
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:44,720
Mary! Mary! Mary!

2120
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:47,040
Have you... Have you seen my wife?

2121
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:49,960
- Merry Christmas, Daddy!
- Merry Christmas, Daddy!

2122
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,600
Kids! Pete!

2123
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:54,200
Oh!

2124
02:03:56,680 --> 02:03:59,720
Kids! Janie! Janie! Tommy!

2125
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:03,160
Oh, let me look at you.

2126
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:04,560
Oh, I could eat you up.

2127
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:08,240
- Where is your mother?
- She went looking for you with Uncle Billy.

2128
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:10,560
- Daddy!
- Zuzu! Zuzu!

2129
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:12,680
My little gingersnap! How do you feel?

2130
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:16,800
- Fine! Not a smitch of temperature.
- Not a smitch of tempe...

2131
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:18,200
Hallelujah!

2132
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:21,080
- George! George!
- Mary! Mary!

2133
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:23,080
George, darling! Where have you been?

2134
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:24,960
George, darling! Where have you been?

2135
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:29,840
- Oh, George, George, George.
- Mary! Let me touch you.

2136
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:32,720
Let me touch you. Oh, you're real!

2137
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:35,400
Oh, George... George.

2138
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:37,320
You have no idea what happened to me.

2139
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:39,640
You have no idea what happened.

2140
02:04:39,680 --> 02:04:43,080
Well, well, come on, George, come on
downstairs, quick. They're on their way.

2141
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:44,760
- All right.
- Come on!

2142
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:49,320
Come on in here now.

2143
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:54,360
Now, you stand right over here, by the tree.
Right there, and don't move, don't move.

2144
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,440
What's happening? Who's gonna come?

2145
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:59,480
I hear 'em coming now,
George, it's a miracle!

2146
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:02,680
- It's a miracle!
- Who's coming?

2147
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:03,640
Who's gonna come, Daddy?

2148
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:04,840
- Who, Daddy?
- I don't know.

2149
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:08,400
Come in, Uncle Billy.
Everybody! In here!

2150
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:16,480
Isn't it wonderful? So many faces!

2151
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:18,080
Mary did it, George! Mary did it!

2152
02:05:18,160 --> 02:05:20,120
She told some people you
were in trouble and then,

2153
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:22,080
they scattered all over
town collecting money.

2154
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:24,960
They didn't ask any questions
- just said: "If George is in trouble, count me in...

2155
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,440
What is this, George?
Another run on the bank?

2156
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:30,960
Here you are, George, Merry Christmas.

2157
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:37,000
The line forms on the right.

2158
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:40,440
Merry Christmas! God bless you.

2159
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:46,920
- Oh, Mr. Martini!
- Merry Christmas!

2160
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:49,320
Step right up here.

2161
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:51,680
I busted the jukebox, too!

2162
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,200
Mr. Gower!

2163
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:00,880
I made the rounds of
all my charge accounts.

2164
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:11,680
- Violet Bick!  - I'm not going to go,
George. I changed my mind.

2165
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:21,680
I've been saving this money for a
divorce, if ever I get a husband.

2166
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:30,080
There you are, George. I got
the faculty all up out of bed.

2167
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:32,120
And here's something
for you to play with.

2168
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:37,080
I wouldn't have a roof over my
head if it wasn't for you, George.

2169
02:06:37,160 --> 02:06:38,920
Just a minute. Just a minute.

2170
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,640
Quiet, everybody. Quiet, quiet.

2171
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:43,760
- I just got this. It's from London.
- Oh.

2172
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:46,520
Mr. Gower cabled you need cash. Stop.

2173
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:50,960
My office instructed to advance you up
to twenty-five thousand dollars. Stop.

2174
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,960
Hee-haw and Merry
Christmas. Sam Wainwright.

2175
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:06,880
Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

2176
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:16,280
Hark, the Herald angels sing

2177
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:20,600
Glory to the new-born king.

2178
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:24,920
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,

2179
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:29,200
God and sinners reconciled.

2180
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:33,480
Joyful all ye nations rise,

2181
02:07:33,560 --> 02:07:37,760
Join the triumph of the skies,

2182
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:41,880
With angelic hosts proclaim

2183
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:45,920
Christ is born in Bethlehem,

2184
02:07:45,960 --> 02:07:50,120
Harry Bailey.

2185
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:55,360
George, old son of a gun.

2186
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:59,120
- Harry! Harry!
- Looks like I got here too late.

2187
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:01,800
Mary, I got him here from the
airport as quickly as I could.

2188
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:03,720
The fool flew all the
way up here in a blizzard.

2189
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:05,480
Harry, how about your
banquet in New York?

2190
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:07,880
Oh, I left right in the middle of
it as soon as I got Mary's telegram.

2191
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:09,920
Good idea, Ernie, a toast...

2192
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,840
to my big brother George.

2193
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:13,720
The richest man in town!

2194
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:21,080
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

2195
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:25,840
And never brought to mind,

2196
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:30,480
Should auld acquaintance

2197
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:37,200
Be forgot, and days of Auld Lang Syne.

2198
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:38,200
What's that?

2199
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:43,080
That's a Christmas present
from a very dear friend of mine.

2200
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:45,280
Look, Daddy.

2201
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:51,680
Teacher says every time a bell
rings, an angel gets his wings.

2202
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:54,680
That's right. That's right.

2203
02:08:56,680 --> 02:08:58,560
Atta boy, Clarence.

2204
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:05,960
For Auld Land Syne, my dear.

2205
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:11,160
For Auld Land Syne

2206
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:16,600
We'll take cup of kindness yet,

2207
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:23,320
For Auld Lang Syne

2208
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:28,320
We'll take cup of kindness yet,

2209
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:36,400
For Auld Lang Syne
