00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,090
Fanny.

3
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,810
Mother.

4
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,410
Siri.

5
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,090
Maj.

6
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,370
Grandmother.

7
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,540
Alexander.

8
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,020
What are you doing?

9
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,020
Do you want to play cards
before dinner?

10
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,980
Fanny and Alexander.

11
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,740
This is the 43rd Christmas
we're celebrating together.

12
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,740
My dear Ester! Is it?

13
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,380
Yes, the 43rd.

14
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,540
Well, well, who'd have thought it?

15
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,020
Yes, it's odd.

16
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,860
Dear Ester.

17
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,860
Good evening, Mrs. Ekdahl.

18
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,940
Good evening, girls.

19
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,780
- Alida, you may join the other girls.
- Thank you, Mrs. Ekdahl.

20
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,540
- Why are you so sullen?
- I'm not sullen.

21
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,140
I can see that you are.

22
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,060
You're always sullen
on Christmas eve.

23
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,540
- I don't know what you mean.
- You heard me. You're sullen.

24
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,020
Old hag.

25
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,500
Worthy Joseph, do not fear

26
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,940
thy angel is thee ever near

27
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,060
I come in haste to bring thee word

28
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,340
from thy creator and thy God

29
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,260
Mary and the child now wake

30
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,460
and quickly into safety take

31
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,460
Herod with his murdering hand

32
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,020
threatens every man-child in this land

33
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,780
all this I have noted well

34
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,740
and shall do as you foretell.

35
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,140
Praised be God upon his throne

36
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,580
who thus protects my only son.

37
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,780
Thus, good people, ends our play

38
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,340
it all ends well on this holy day.

39
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,540
The son of God, saved from the sword

40
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,420
is our saviour, Christ the Lord.

41
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,780
We know that in his mercy mild

42
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,700
he guards every woman, man and child.
man and each boy.

43
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,820
A time of joyous Christmas cheer

44
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,100
we wish to all, both far and near

45
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,060
let no one into darkness fall.

46
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,780
A merry Christmas one and all.

47
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,540
traditionally the Ekdahls give a party
for the theatre staff down on the stage.

48
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,380
The guests are what you'd call
a rather mixed lot.

49
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,660
Quite different from what we're used to
here in the theatre restaurant.

50
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,060
Nevertheless, I don't want to see
any supercilious glances,

51
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,940
snootiness, or raised eyebrows.

52
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,700
I want to see generosity,
warmth and kindness. Is that clear?

53
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,180
- Yes, sir.
- That's the spirit!

54
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,020
Alma and Petra,
take the Christmas basket.

55
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,620
I'll take the punch bowl.

56
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,060
- Are we ready?
- Yes, sir.

57
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,340
Forward march!

58
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,870
Come along, Carlchen.

59
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,750
We mustn't be late
to your mother's like last year.

60
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,590
Come along.

61
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,470
Let's go.

62
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,390
Hurry up.

63
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,750
Merry Christmas!

64
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,630
Merry Christmas, Oscar.

65
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,430
Help yourselves, everybody!

66
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,430
Step forward, step forward.
Don't be shy.

67
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,990
My dear friends.

68
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,430
for 22 years...

69
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,510
in the capacity of theatre manager,

70
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,990
I致e stood here and made a speech...

71
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,750
without really having any talent...

72
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,270
for that sort of thing.

73
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,550
Especially if you think of my father,

74
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,630
who was brilliant at speeches.

75
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:59,510
My only talent,
if you can call it that in my case...

76
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,230
is that I love this little world...

77
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,630
inside the thick walls
of this playhouse.

78
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:15,230
And I知 fond of the people
who work in this little world.

79
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,470
Outside is the big world,

80
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,390
and sometimes
the little world succeeds...

81
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,190
in reflecting the big one...

82
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,870
so that we understand it better.

83
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,150
Or perhaps we give the people
who come here

84
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:51,830
a chance to forget for a while...

85
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,510
for a few short moments...

86
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,630
for a few short moments...

87
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,230
the harsh world outside.

88
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:19,150
Our theatre is...

89
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,630
a little room...

90
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,510
of orderliness, routine, care...

91
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,830
...and love.

92
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,030
I don't know why I feel...

93
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,870
so comically solemn... this evening.

94
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,830
When you've given Ismael his dinner,

95
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,830
turn off the lights in the shop
and lock up.

96
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,110
I have the key.

97
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,630
Good night, Aron.

98
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,110
Good night, uncle lsak.

99
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,350
lsak!

100
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,950
Merry Christmas.

101
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,430
I can't think where they all are.

102
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,070
They should have been here
a long time ago.

103
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,950
I expect Oscar is making
a long, dull speech.

104
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,750
I think I hear them
down in the street.

105
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,030
Ester, bring me my furcoat.

106
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,190
There comes my family.

107
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,430
Merry Christmas.

108
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,430
Merry Christmas, grandma.

109
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,910
Merry Christmas, aunt.

110
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,990
Mom, you look so beautiful.

111
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,150
What is it, drling?

112
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,710
Aunt Emma how nice to see you.

113
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,590
Aunt Emma, how nice. Welcome.

114
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,910
What time is it?

115
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,630
The only question is:
Where are Carl and Lydia?

116
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,710
Perhaps they got the wrong time.

117
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,550
Christmas dinner is always at 4:30.

118
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:06,910
Alexander, run down
and ring uncle Carl痴 doorbell.

119
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,470
- Carlchen, please hurry.
- Shut up!

120
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,790
- We're so late.
- Shut up!

121
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,150
We arrive late every year.

122
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,870
- I'm doing this for your sake.
- No more, mein Carlchen.

123
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,190
- Mom.
- Well, Carl.

124
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,430
Merry Christmas, aunt.

125
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,750
Well, at last we can have dinner.

126
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,470
What would Maj say to a little visit
in her room this evening?

127
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,870
The master must be joking.

128
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,470
Are you all right, sir?

129
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,390
I'm fine.

130
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,230
I must help the girls with the tree.

131
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,350
- Aren't you angry?
- Angry?

132
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,270
I think it's sweet.

133
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,550
Children, come.

134
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:50,150
Uncle Carl is going to treat you
to one helluva fireworks show.

135
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,390
Stay here.

136
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,110
Ready?

137
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,070
Number one.

138
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,190
Now comes number two.

139
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:27,510
Now comes number three.

140
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,310
Alexander, bring the candle.

141
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,070
"And it came to pass in those days

142
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,470
that there went out a decree
from Caesar Augustus

143
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,150
that all the world should be taxed.

144
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,230
And this taxing was first made

145
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:59,070
when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.

146
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:05,750
And all went to be taxed,
every one into his own city.

147
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,310
And Joseph also went up from Galilee

148
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:15,110
out of the city of Nazareth,
into Judea...

149
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:19,470
unto the city of David,
which is called Bethlehem...

150
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,790
because he was of the house
and lineage of David,

151
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:29,670
to be taxed with Mary his wife,

152
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,630
who was pregnant.

153
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,190
- Give up?
- No!

154
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,910
I'm sorry.
It's a terrible mess in here.

155
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,310
Come see us later
and you'll get a Christmas present.

156
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,350
Thank you, Mrs. Ekdahl.

157
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,950
Now then, children, to bed.

158
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,350
Hurry up, Alexander.

159
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,630
To bed now, children.

160
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,390
Now say your prayers.

161
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,630
Thank you God for this day.
Please make me good.

162
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,590
May your angel stay by me
through the night.

163
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,350
God bless papa and mama,
grandpapa and grandmama,

164
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,910
myself and my brothers and sisters
and cousins, uncles and aunts,

165
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:38,430
Vega, Ester, Maj, Siri, Berta, Alida, Lisen
and uncle Isak and everybody else.

166
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,510
Amen.

167
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,430
- Good night, Alexander.
- Good night, sweetheart.

168
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,350
Good night. Sleep well.

169
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,270
Putte kisses like a real man.

170
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,190
Alexander.

171
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,390
Alexander.

172
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,870
Look at my Christmas present.

173
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,110
Look what Mrs. Ekdahl gave me.

174
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,790
Aren't I beautiful?
Don't I look lovely?

175
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,870
I look like a real lady.

176
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,430
Don't you think?

177
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,790
Tonight you can't sleep in Maj's bed
because Maj will have a visitor.

178
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,870
And I can't just have
all the men in my bed.

179
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,230
But you're Maj's sweetheart.
You know that.

180
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,950
Well, my dear ones,
it's time to say good night.

181
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,470
We're getting up early.

182
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,110
Carlchen! Wake up.

183
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,870
We're going home.

184
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,710
Good night, mama.
Carl's a bit tired. I'll give him a hand.

185
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,230
Come along now.
We're going home.

186
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,110
Good night.

187
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,910
Good night, mom.

188
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,870
- I stayed behind.
- So I noticed.

189
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:47,190
There she lies, the beautiful girl,
poor Arabella.

190
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,750
Little does she know what awaits her.

191
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,950
She's alone in the whole house.

192
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:03,630
Her mother is dead, and her father
is carousing with loose companions.

193
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,750
Who comes there as the clock
strikes 12:00 in the castle tower?

194
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,470
"Fear seizes me.

195
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,790
What is that terrifying white figure

196
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,350
floating on the moonbeams
and drawing near my bed?

197
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,430
It is my dead mother.
My mother's ghost."

198
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,270
No more noise in here now!

199
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,230
Go to sleep, children.
Good night.

200
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,870
I thought I smelled
kerosene in the nursery.

201
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:51,630
- Kerosene?
- Yes, kerosene.

202
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,790
There's no kerosene lamp
in the nursery.

203
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,550
Well, it smells like it anyway.

204
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,030
Here we go, Isak.
I've made some nice strong coffee.

205
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,990
Much better than Vega痴
awful dishwater.

206
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,710
Give this a try.

207
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,350
What can the time be?
Ten past 3:00.

208
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,790
We can sit for two hours,

209
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,070
and then I must change
for early service.

210
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,750
How good it is to have you here!

211
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,630
You're my best friend.

212
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,830
Whatever would I do without you?

213
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:45,430
Last year I enjoyed Christmas.

214
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,590
This year all I wanted to do was cry.

215
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,870
I suppose I知 getting old.

216
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,910
Do you think I致e aged?

217
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,670
You've grown older, yes.

218
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,350
I thought so.

219
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,910
Yes, I just wanted to cry.

220
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,870
Though I love having
the grandchildren, of course.

221
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,750
I didn't think Oscar looked well.

222
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,790
He wears himself out
with that theatre.

223
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,510
And the idea of him playing
the ghost.

224
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,350
He should take it easy.

225
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,870
Besides, he's an awfully bad actor.

226
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:35,110
I wonder if Emilie realizes
that he's weak and needs rest.

227
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,390
I think I値l have a word with her.

228
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,710
He's capable, of course.
Capable and conscientious.

229
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:52,390
Can you believe the theatre
even makes a small profit?

230
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,950
Isn't that splendid?

231
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,910
A few years ago I contributed
a minimum of 50,000 kronor per year.

232
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:01,670
I didn't care, but Oscar felt
so awkward asking me for money.

233
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,910
Not like Carl.

234
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,350
He asked me for a new loan,
but I refused.

235
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,830
If he comes to you for money,
you must say no too.

236
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,190
- Promise me that.
- Yes, yes.

237
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,750
I don't understand it.

238
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,790
Time and again
I clear everything up for him.

239
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,390
After a year, he's in dire straits again.

240
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:31,550
He says he doesn't go to moneylenders.

241
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,990
- Do you know?
- No.

242
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,390
And that poor German woman
he's married to.

243
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,790
How could he have fallen for her?

244
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,750
It must be something erotic.

245
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,030
What do you think?

246
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,350
Erotic? Yes, perhaps.

247
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,510
- You're not listening.
- Yes, I am.

248
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:55,630
Never mind. The main thing is
that you keep me company.

249
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,910
Carl and Gustav Adolf are oversexed.

250
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,910
They take after their father.
He was oversexed.

251
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:14,110
At times I thought
it was too much of a good thing,

252
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,670
but I never refused.

253
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,550
Gustav Adolf is incorrigible.

254
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:23,310
I've spoken with Alma, and she wisely says
she doesn't mind his philandering,

255
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,550
because he's the kindest husband
in the world.

256
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,750
It's fortunate that Alma
is so understanding.

257
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:38,150
Perhaps I ought to warn that nursemaid Maj,
or whatever her name is.

258
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,070
I must say she's very pretty,
and good with the children.

259
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,150
Beautiful colouring and a nice figure.

260
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,710
Pity she limps, the poor thing.

261
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:54,510
Are you sad
because you've grown old?

262
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:59,110
I'm certainly not.
Everything's getting worse.

263
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,750
Worse people,
worse machines, worse wars...

264
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,790
and worse weather.

265
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,310
I'm glad I値l soon be dead.

266
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:12,430
You're an incorrigible old misanthrope
and always have been.

267
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:16,230
- I don't agree with you.
- I thought as much.

268
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:19,510
That doesn't stop me from crying.

269
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:24,190
Would you mind if I cry a little?

270
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,670
No, upon my soul, I can't.
The tears won't come.

271
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,150
I'll have to have some more cognac.

272
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,310
What are you laughing at?

273
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:04,510
Do you remember when we sat there
on the sofa kissing madly?

274
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,630
You had unbuttoned my blouse,

275
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,510
and something else too.

276
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,230
Then suddenly the curtain
was drawn aside,

277
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,190
and there stood my dear husband.

278
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,390
It was just like a play by Feydeau.

279
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:24,350
I screamed and you made for the door.

280
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:30,270
He rushed off to get his pistol,
with me hanging on his leg.

281
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:36,070
You became friends for life.

282
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,590
Your husband was a great-hearted man.

283
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,870
Now I知 weeping.

284
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,150
The happy, splendid life is over,

285
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:54,790
and the horrible,
dirty life engulfs us.

286
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,070
That's the way it is.

287
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:10,150
This won't do.

288
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,190
I must wash up
and redo my makeup,

289
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:17,390
do my hair and put on
my corset and silk dress.

290
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:24,790
A weepy, lovesick woman turns
into a self-possessed grandmother.

291
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,790
We all play our parts.

292
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:32,190
Some play them negligently,
others with great care.

293
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,310
I'm one of the latter.

294
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,990
Good night, my lovely Helena.

295
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,750
You were a sweet lover.

296
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,110
Like strawberries.

297
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,190
You wanted me to help you
with your morning toilet, Mrs. Ekdahl.

298
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,310
The time is ten to 5:00.

299
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,190
A cafe on castle street.

300
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:05,950
Your own cakes and pastries,

301
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,910
tarts and confections.

302
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,190
What do you say to that, little Maj?

303
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:20,030
You'd be in charge of it.

304
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,710
Just yesterday I said to Alma,

305
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:28,790
"look at Maj. She's a princess."

306
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,710
What breasts you have, my girl.

307
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,590
Let me see properly.

308
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,230
You drive me crazy.

309
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,870
Don't be afraid, child.

310
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:44,110
I am a wonderful lover.
All the women say that.

311
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:48,550
Once you get me on my back,
you'll forget about the cafe.

312
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,630
I swear.

313
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,670
Give me something to write on.

314
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,750
Come. Come over here.

315
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,030
Here's a pen.

316
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,110
Now I値l write:

317
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,270
"Maj Kling...

318
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,750
is the proprietress of my cafe."

319
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:17,390
Signed, Gustav Adolf Ekdahl.

320
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:24,630
Christmas night, 1907.

321
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,990
There! That's a contract.

322
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:32,830
Stick it under a lawyer's nose
if I forget my promise.

323
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,510
Be careful not to put me
in the family way.

324
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,990
Well, what do you say?
Aren't I nice?

325
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,990
Ever felt such a wooden leg?

326
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,350
Damnation!
The rocket went off too soon.

327
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:11,910
Oh, well, it happens.
Wasn't it wonderful?

328
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:15,750
You're a real Billy goat, sir.

329
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,830
And you're my little lamb.

330
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:23,270
I must lie on my back.
I'm all in a sweat.

331
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:26,710
- I ate and drank too much.
- You're not ill?

332
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,910
Not me!
I feel like a bakery ablaze.

333
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,230
Or should I say cafe?

334
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,230
Ill? When I知 with
such a tasty little morsel?

335
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,550
Sit on top of me.

336
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,630
Oh, you're impossible, sir!

337
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,070
Ride a rocking horse to Banbury cross

338
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:53,830
to see a fine lady on a white steed

339
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:59,590
- My goodness, how your heart's pounding.
- I've got a splendid heart.

340
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:18,870
- Your heart this beating.
- I Have a splendid heart.

341
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,470
Now you'll have to give me a new bed.

342
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:25,870
You'll have a cafe,
an apartment,

343
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,870
beautiful furniture, and a big bed.

344
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:32,430
- And pretty clothes.
- No one will be prettier.

345
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:35,350
You will be Gustav Adolf's mistress,

346
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:39,070
and I値l come see you
every Wednesday and Saturday at 3:00.

347
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,070
How silly you are.

348
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,870
- What?
- I said you're silly.

349
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,990
- Silly, am I?
- You're a real numbskull.

350
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:53,230
I'm not a numbskull!

351
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,150
You are, for imagining
I壇 want anything from you.

352
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,950
Don't you want anything?

353
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,350
Don't you see I was joking?

354
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,230
Joking?

355
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:10,670
In what way?

356
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,470
Don't be angry.

357
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:16,550
I'm not, but I don't like
being treated like an idiot.

358
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:22,790
- Stop laughing.
- I think you're so funny.

359
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:34,710
I can feel a cold coming on.

360
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:37,310
My throat hurts when I swallow.

361
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,350
My teeth are tingling.

362
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,950
It's freezing in here.
Why isn't there any heat?

363
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,590
We don't have any credit
with the wood merchant.

364
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,510
We owe 150 kronor.
Das weisst du doch.

365
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:56,590
You haven't learned
a damn bit of Swedish in 23 years.

366
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,630
Speak Swedish!

367
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,550
I do my best.

368
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:04,310
Last Tuesday I asked mama
for ten thousand to sort out my affairs.

369
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:09,870
She took out a paper
that said I owed her 37,000.

370
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,270
It's incredible.

371
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:14,670
- You'll have to go to the Jew.
- I've already been.

372
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:17,830
I'm paying one hell
of an exorbitant interest rate,

373
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,470
and if I don't pay on time,
he'll show the paper to mama.

374
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,070
I have some jewellery.

375
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,110
Idiot.

376
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:28,350
That would be nice. Professor Ekdahl
running to the pawnbroker.

377
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,110
Aren't you coming to bed?

378
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:42,670
Come, Carlchen.
Come and sit by me.

379
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,230
You smell bad.

380
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:56,870
Have you given up washing,
or are you starting to rot?

381
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:02,470
No. I don't smell bad at all.

382
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:06,190
You have olfactory hallucinations.

383
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,190
It's bleeding.

384
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:28,710
- Shall I bandage it up?
- No.

385
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:36,950
- Won't you try and get some sleep?
- Yes.

386
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:41,630
I feel sorry for you, mein Carlchen.

387
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,590
How is it one becomes second-rate?

388
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,390
Can you tell me that?

389
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,550
How does the dust fall?

390
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:58,110
When has one lost?

391
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,870
First I知 a prince,
heir to the kingdom.

392
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:11,790
Suddenly, before I know it...

393
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,230
I知 deposed.

394
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,350
Death taps me on the shoulder.

395
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:24,910
The room is cold...

396
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,750
and we can't pay for kindling.

397
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,390
I'm stupid and unkind.

398
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,350
And I知 most unkind...

399
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,870
to the only person who cares for me.

400
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:51,430
You can never forgive me.

401
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,470
I'm a shit and a cad.

402
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,070
If you like,
I値l make you a hot toddy.

403
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:01,630
Don't be so damned servile!

404
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:08,070
Wipe your mouth.
Your lips are always wet. It's disgusting!

405
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:12,630
I didn't mean to be rude.

406
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:18,470
I know, mein liebling.

407
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,070
Oh, life!

408
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:35,910
Insomnia, poverty and humiliation.

409
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:42,670
Stretch out your hand
and you grope in the emptiness.

410
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:49,230
Why am I such a bloody coward?

411
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,950
Good night.

412
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:38,790
- Good morning, papa.
- Good morning, Petra.

413
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:41,950
Won't you give me a kiss?

414
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,470
- Good morning, Gustav Adolf.
- Good morning, Alma.

415
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,430
Go and fry three eggs
and some ham for papa,

416
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,230
and make two cheese sandwiches.

417
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,910
- What will you drink?
- Beer.

418
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:04,270
Petra, you know
where the beer crate is.

419
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,510
No, wait, I think there's some stout
in the cupboard.

420
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,150
- Would you rather have stout?
- Yes.

421
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:16,350
Don't stand there staring.
We have to be at grandma's in an hour.

422
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:25,470
- How do you feel?
- Cognac.

423
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,670
- I've put out your clothes.
- Thank you.

424
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,430
And there's hot water
if you want a bath.

425
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,190
That would be nice.

426
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:40,310
Hurry up now.

427
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:04,230
You're a damned handsome woman.

428
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,710
And you're a big shit.

429
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:20,230
- Come to bed.
- I just did my hair.

430
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:24,350
We'll have a quick one standing up.

431
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:28,710
- Petra's coming with breakfast.
- We'll lock the door.

432
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:32,790
Come on then, but make it quick.

433
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:17,790
- I don't think I can.
- You can't?

434
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:20,430
No. There must be something wrong.

435
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:26,830
- You're not sick, are you?
- I'm fit as a fiddle.

436
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,750
- Lie down on the bed.
- Yes, I guess I could do that.

437
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:40,550
- Shall I bring in the breakfast tray?
- Yes, please.

438
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,390
To think that I haven't killed you.

439
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,750
Now what do you say?

440
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,670
Well, my friends, it's time.

441
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:08,510
Sleeping within my orchard
my custom always of the afternoon

442
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:14,030
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole

443
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:18,150
with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial

444
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:23,990
and in the porches of my ears
did pour the leperous distilment,

445
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:30,150
whose effect holds
such an enmity with blood of man

446
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:33,350
that swift as quicksilver
it courses through

447
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:36,350
the natural gates and alleys
of the body

448
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:40,110
and with a sudden vigour
it doth possess and curd,

449
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:45,590
like eager droppings into milk,
the thin and wholesome blood:

450
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:52,310
So did it mine and a most
instant tetter bark'd about

451
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:57,430
most lazar-like,
with vile and loathsome crust.

452
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:04,990
Oh, horrible, most horrible!

453
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:08,110
If thou hast nature in thee,
bear it not.

454
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:11,990
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be

455
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:18,350
a couch for luxury and damned incest.

456
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,590
I've forgotten what I am to do.

457
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:31,670
You get up and exit upstage centre.

458
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:55,550
- Where am I?
- Here... at the theatre.

459
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:24,510
Let's go home and rest.

460
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,430
What's happened?

461
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,030
You're tired, that's all.

462
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:34,150
Shall I call for the ambulance?

463
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:40,630
What am I doing here?

464
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:45,750
You were acting.

465
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:48,150
I was acting?

466
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,350
Why was I acting?

467
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,790
Come along, Oscar.
Let's go home.

468
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03,670
Am I going to die now?

469
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:06,630
Please help me.

470
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,430
I'll get a carriage.

471
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:15,270
He needs his overcoat.

472
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:36,270
Alexander, come along.

473
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:57,390
Come on.

474
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:14,350
Stop!

475
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:18,790
I said stop! Hey, you!

476
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,750
Take the cart behind you!

477
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:25,030
No.

478
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,030
No.

479
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,110
We know nothing yet.

480
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:36,630
Yes, let's hope so.
Thank you for calling.

481
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:52,150
- How is our dear Oscar?
- We can only hope.

482
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:24,670
- How is he?
- It's a matter of hours.

483
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:28,070
- Is he in pain?
- He sleeps most of the time.

484
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:45,270
Go see Ester and Vega
for hot chocolate and sandwiches.

485
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:52,750
Just imagine, children.

486
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:57,710
This letter will go all the way
to a mission in China.

487
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:01,630
Mr. Albrektsson told me
his poodle had four puppies.

488
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:06,390
A friend of mine
has lived there for 50 years.

489
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:12,350
He wondered
if you'd like a puppy.

490
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:15,230
Mom won't let us
have dogs or cats.

491
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:17,390
- We could keep it here.
- Really?

492
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:18,990
- Yes.
- Splendid.

493
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:20,950
Otherwise it'll be sold.

494
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:25,030
When I was in China,
working in the fields with my friend,

495
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:28,270
we had a dog and three cats.

496
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:34,310
- Want to play again?
- You take red, then.

497
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:39,870
Mr. Albrektsson
makes lots of money on his dogs,

498
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,830
but he wants to give this puppy away.

499
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:43,630
He's wealthy in his own right.

500
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:47,390
It's his wife's money, dear Ester.

501
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:56,550
Would you two like
a molasses sandwich?

502
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:59,190
Yes, please, miss Vega.

503
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,870
There, the letter's finished.

504
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:06,670
Come, Fanny,
and I値l let you lick the envelope.

505
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:15,470
- Would you like to borrow the flute?
- No, thank you.

506
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:19,870
- You want to lick the stamp?
- No, thank you.

507
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,870
You lick the stamp, then.

508
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:29,390
Thank you, sweetheart.

509
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:33,950
Leave me alone.

510
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:51,510
Come in.

511
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,270
Your mom asked me to come get you.

512
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,350
Let's put down the sandwiches.

513
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:13,870
Come, Alexander.
Don't be afraid.

514
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:22,550
Come here, Alexander.

515
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:28,390
Come on.

516
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,510
I'll wait outside.

517
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:07,630
Come here, Fanny.

518
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:25,830
Tell Alexander
there's nothing to be afraid of.

519
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:27,870
I'll tell him.

520
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:49,470
I could play the ghost now...

521
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:53,310
really well.

522
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:00,870
Nothing.

523
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:04,230
Nothing...

524
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:07,950
separates me from all of you.

525
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:09,870
Not now...

526
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:12,590
...and not later.

527
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:17,150
I know that.

528
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:23,510
I see it...

529
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:28,670
quite clearly.

530
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:32,750
I'll be closer to you now...

531
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:36,590
than when I lived.

532
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:44,270
Now I壇 like to look at Alexander.

533
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,670
Alexander.

534
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:59,670
Father says there's nothing
to be afraid of.

535
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:11,790
Don't be childish now.

536
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:14,910
Try to be a good boy.

537
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:23,950
Fanny, wake up.
Did you hear that?

538
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:10,910
Piss, hell, shit,

539
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:16,030
fart, cock, cunt, damn, hell,

540
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:22,150
crap, ass, piss, cock, butt, pussy.

541
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:10,830
Siri, tell the children
they may leave the table.

542
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:12,350
Yes, ma'am.

543
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:05,230
Did you hear something?

544
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:24,430
Alexander, wake up.

545
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:26,990
There's something out there.

546
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:42,630
Good day.
Good day, Alexander.

547
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:45,270
Please give my regards
to your mother.

548
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:07,630
Hello.

549
01:17:21,790 --> 01:17:23,030
What's wrong?

550
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:47,750
Alexander, someone wishes to talk to you.

551
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,710
The hot chocolate will have to wait.

552
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:59,310
- What have I done?
- You know quite well.

553
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:14,510
- Good day, Alexander.
- Good day.

554
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:18,990
We met once before.

555
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:21,950
Under sadder circumstances,
when I officiated at your father's funeral.

556
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:27,990
Since then, your mother has turned to me
with her worries, as is only natural.

557
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:31,870
I am a close friend
of your grandmother.

558
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:34,590
I'm the spiritual guide of the parish.

559
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:39,270
The Bishop has been very good to me
during this difficult time.

560
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:42,390
We've also spoken of you, my son.

561
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:45,470
I've told the Bishop how proud I am
of my well-behaved children.

562
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:48,270
You and your sister
are doing well at school, I知 told.

563
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,830
Diligent and attentive,
and earning good grades.

564
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:53,030
Isn't that correct, Alexander?

565
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:56,470
Don't be afraid.
I'm your friend and wish you well.

566
01:18:57,230 --> 01:18:58,550
You believe me, don't you?

567
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:03,950
But diligence and good grades
are not everything in this world.

568
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:05,470
Blow your nose, Alexander.

569
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:14,590
That's filthy!
Didn't Maj give you a clean handkerchief?

570
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:15,870
Yes.

571
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:17,390
Goddamn it all!

572
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:25,110
As I said, diligence and good grades
aren't everything in this world.

573
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:27,190
Listen to the Bishop, Alexander.

574
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:28,750
I'm sure he is.

575
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:31,190
Aren't you, Alexander?

576
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:34,190
You're anxious to know
what I知 going to say.

577
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:37,590
You're a big boy now.

578
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:41,390
So I値l talk to you man to man.

579
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:45,390
Can you tell me -

580
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:49,190
can you explain to me

581
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:51,510
what a lie is

582
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:53,270
and what the truth is?

583
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:01,630
You think that was a stupid question,
and it probably was.

584
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,590
I was just kidding with you.

585
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:06,990
Of course you know what a lie is
and what the truth is, don't you?

586
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:09,550
Splendid, my boy..

587
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:12,390
I am satisfied.

588
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,710
You also know why one lies.

589
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:22,030
Why does one lie?

590
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:26,790
Why does one lie?

591
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:30,390
Can you explain to me why one lies?

592
01:20:32,230 --> 01:20:34,030
Because you don't
want to tell the truth.

593
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:40,790
A very sly answer, my young friend.

594
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:44,790
But you won't get off so easily.

595
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:47,270
I asked you...

596
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:52,430
why does one not tell the truth?

597
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:54,350
I don't know.

598
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:58,190
We have plenty of time, Alexander,

599
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:00,230
and I'm so interested in your answer

600
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:02,510
that I'am prepared for
to wait indefinitely.

601
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:06,990
You may not believe that,
but it's true.

602
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,000
One lies to gain an advantage.

603
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,320
Good answer, my boy.

604
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,920
Good and concise.

605
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:22,080
Forgive me if I ask another question,
a bit more personal this time.

606
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:28,000
Can you explain to your mother and me
why you lied at school?

607
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,600
What?

608
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:32,960
Your teacher has written to me,

609
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,640
saying that you've been spreading
the most incredible lies.

610
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,760
Like what?

611
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,000
Sold to a circus!

612
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:42,440
Do you deny
that you told your classmates

613
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,080
that I sold you to a travelling circus,

614
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,240
and that at the end of the semester

615
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,520
they're coming to get you?

616
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,360
You are to train
as an acrobat and circus rider,

617
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:00,240
together with a gypsy
your age named Tamara.

618
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,960
Go to your mother
and ask her forgiveness

619
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:11,480
for all the sorrow and worry
you've caused her.

620
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,480
Go to your mother
and ask her to forgive you.

621
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,560
Did you hear what I said or not?

622
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,600
I ask mother's forgiveness for lying,
and I promise never to do it again.

623
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,840
The matter is resolved
and need never be mentioned again.

624
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,640
Imagination is a splendid thing,

625
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,440
a mighty force, a gift from God.

626
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,600
It's held in trust for us
by the great artists,

627
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,760
writers and musicians.

628
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,600
I'll get Fanny.

629
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,840
Come Alexander.

630
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,440
I have something important
to tell you.

631
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,840
Edvard has asked if I will marry him.

632
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,120
I've accepted with gratitude and joy.

633
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,520
I've been alone for a long time,

634
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:42,320
and my children need a firm hand.

635
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:43,840
A father.

636
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,640
Of course, a great deal will be -

637
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:58,160
may God in his mercy
take care of our little family.

638
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:06,320
Let us kneel down
and unite in a heartfelt prayer.

639
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:20,080
May God our father in his mercy
take care of our little family

640
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:24,680
and bless us and keep us from evil
all the days of our life.

641
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:31,120
God give me strength

642
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:35,240
to be a guardian and a worthy example
to these little fatherless ones.

643
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:41,040
Give me strength as well
to be a support

644
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,880
to this lonely young woman.

645
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,480
In the 15th century,
when this house was built,

646
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:59,280
they didn't bother much about comfort.

647
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:05,200
My predecessors kept it all as it was,
and I follow the tradition.

648
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:10,920
These old rooms have
an imperishable beauty.

649
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:17,520
We should be grateful that we may live
in an atmosphere of purity and austerity.

650
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,600
Ah, here come my mother and sister.

651
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,360
Welcome Mrs. Ekdahl.

652
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:26,640
Thank you.

653
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,440
This is my sister Henrietta.

654
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,680
- Welcome to the Bishop's palace.
- Thank you.

655
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,920
Come and say hello, children.

656
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,520
This is Mrs. Tander,
our capable cook,

657
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,800
who's been with our family
for 30 years.

658
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,840
This is my future wife,
Mrs. Emilie Ekdahl.

659
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,160
Good day, Mrs. Ekdahl. Welcome.

660
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:57,360
These are our capable helpers:
Karna, Selma and little Justina.

661
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,000
Now we'll go see my aunt,
who, alas, is sick and bedridden.

662
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,920
How are you today, aunt Elsa?

663
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:13,600
We have a visitor.

664
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,640
Don't be afraid, children.
Come and say hello.

665
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:20,440
My future wife, Mrs. Emilie Ekdahl,
the famous actress.

666
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,480
Hello, miss Bergius.

667
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:51,160
The children have fallen asleep.

668
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,000
It's late and we must go home.

669
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,760
- Not yet.
- What is it, Edvard?

670
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,040
I have a wish.

671
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,680
A single wish, but an important one.

672
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:04,480
You may change your mind
if you find it impossible.

673
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,160
Tell me your wish.

674
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:10,600
I want you to come to my house
without possessions.

675
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,320
What do you mean?

676
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,840
I want you to leave your home...

677
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:23,800
your clothes, jewels, furniture...

678
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,320
your valuables...

679
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:30,640
your friends, habits and thoughts.

680
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,400
I want you to leave
your former life entirely.

681
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,160
Am I to come naked?

682
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,640
I'm serious, my dear.

683
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,520
I want you to come
to your new life as if newly born.

684
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,840
- And the children?
- The children also.

685
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:51,240
- Their toys, dolls, books -
- Nothing.

686
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:57,800
- I must talk to them.
- It's your decision.

687
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,840
I can decide for myself,
but not for the children.

688
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,440
I must ask them.

689
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,720
They must sacrifice something
for their mother's happiness.

690
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,640
You're angry.

691
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,440
Kiss me.

692
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,760
I'm not angry, not in the least.

693
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,200
I'll win them over.

694
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,800
Think it over, Emilie.

695
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,880
I've already thought it over.

696
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,760
For me it's not hard
to grant your wish.

697
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,480
I've never cared for anything
very seriously.

698
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,920
I've sometimes wondered

699
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:42,080
if there wasn't something
very wrong with my feelings.

700
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:46,080
I couldn't understand
why nothing really hurt...

701
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,560
why I never felt really happy.

702
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,520
I know now that
the crucial moment has come.

703
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,560
I know that we'll hurt each other,

704
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,000
but I'm not afraid.

705
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,760
I also know that we will
make each other happy.

706
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:09,560
And I sometimes weep from fear,
because time is so short,

707
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,320
the days pass so quickly,
and nothing lasts forever.

708
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,240
Kiss me, now,

709
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,400
and hold me in your arms,
as only you can.

01:29:19,305 --> 01:29:25,636
