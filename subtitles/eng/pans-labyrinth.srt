00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:49,753
<i>Spain, 1944</i>

3
00:00:50,956 --> 00:00:52,324
<i>The Civil War is over.</i>

4
00:00:52,324 --> 00:00:54,459
<i>Hidden in the mountains,</i>

5
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:56,662
<i>armed men are still fighting
the new Fascist regime.</i>

6
00:00:56,662 --> 00:00:58,926
<i>Military posts are established
to exterminate the Resistance.</i>

7
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,820
A long time ago,

8
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,861
in the Underground Realm,
where there are no lies or pain,

9
00:01:33,932 --> 00:01:37,925
there lived a princess who dreamt
of the human world.

10
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:45,137
She dreamt of blue skies,
soft breeze and sunshine.

11
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:51,442
One day,

12
00:01:52,184 --> 00:01:55,813
eluding her keepers,
the princess escaped.

13
00:02:00,692 --> 00:02:03,718
Once outside...

14
00:02:04,196 --> 00:02:07,825
the bright sun blinded her
and erased her memory.

15
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:13,966
She forgot who she was
and where she came from.

16
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:20,674
Her body suffered cold, sickness and pain.
And eventually she died.

17
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:24,243
However, her father, the king,

18
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:27,575
always knew that the Princess' soul
would return,

19
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:29,553
perhaps in another body,

20
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:32,747
in another place, at another time.

21
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:36,685
He would wait for her,
until he drew his last breath,

22
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:40,327
until the world stopped turning.

23
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:51,698
Why did you bring
so many books, Ofelia?

24
00:02:51,877 --> 00:02:54,471
We're going to the country,
the outdoors.

25
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:01,646
Fairy tales?

26
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:06,149
You're a bit too old to be filling your head
with such nonsense.

27
00:03:09,227 --> 00:03:11,127
Ask him to stop the car.

28
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:28,110
Ofelia, wait.

29
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:30,406
Your brother's not well.

30
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:35,177
Madam, are you okay?

31
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,987
Ofelia?

32
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,291
Ofelia, Come here.

33
00:04:51,496 --> 00:04:54,727
- I saw a fairy.
- Just look at your shoes!

34
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:56,956
Let's go.

35
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:01,004
When we get to the mill,
come out to greet the Captain.

36
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:03,070
I want you to call him Father.

37
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:05,942
You have no idea
how good he's been to us.

38
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:10,644
It's just a word, Ofelia...
just a word...

39
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:38,304
They're coming, Captain.

40
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:40,801
15 minutes late.

41
00:05:58,763 --> 00:05:59,923
Carmen.

42
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:08,702
Welcome.

43
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:15,945
That's not necessary.
I can walk perfectly well.

44
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:18,882
Doctor Ferreiro prefers
that you don't exert yourself.

45
00:06:19,618 --> 00:06:20,448
No.

46
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,489
Come.
Do it for me.

47
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:31,753
Thank you.

48
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:34,791
Ofelia, come out.

49
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,894
Say hello to the Captain.

50
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:42,997
Ofelia.

51
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:53,344
It's the other hand, Ofelia.

52
00:06:57,288 --> 00:06:58,312
Mercedes!

53
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:02,424
- Bring the luggage.
- Sir.

54
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:09,684
It's a labyrinth.

55
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:15,756
Just a pile of old rocks
that have always been here.

56
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:18,059
Even before the mill.

57
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,071
Better not to go in there.
You may get lost.

58
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:23,901
Thank you.

59
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:25,773
Have you read them all?

60
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:27,209
Mercedes!

61
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:30,303
The Captain is calling.

62
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:33,977
Your father needs me.

63
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:38,047
He's not my father.

64
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,482
The Captain is not my father.

65
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:43,991
My father was a tailor.
He died in the war.

66
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,460
He's not my father.

67
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:49,299
You've made that clear enough.
Shall we go?

68
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:51,796
Have you seen my mother?

69
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,862
- Isn't she beautiful!
- Yes.

70
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:56,671
She's sick with baby.
Did you notice?

71
00:09:14,526 --> 00:09:16,323
The guerrillas are sticking
to the woods

72
00:09:16,628 --> 00:09:18,425
because it's hard
to track them up there.

73
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:21,895
Those bastards know the terrain
better than any of us.

74
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,727
We'll block all access
to the woods

75
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:28,163
Food, medicine-
we'll store it all. Right here.

76
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:31,240
We need to force them down,
make them come to us.

77
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:33,305
We'll set up three
new command posts.

78
00:09:33,478 --> 00:09:37,073
Here, here and here.

79
00:09:37,248 --> 00:09:38,272
Mercedes.

80
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:42,076
- Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:48,885
This will help you sleep
through the night.

82
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:52,686
Just two drops just before bed.

83
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:57,026
Two drops only.

84
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:00,401
Very good.

85
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,570
All of it.
Good.

86
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:10,536
Don't hesitate to call me
if you need anything. Day or night.

87
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:15,181
You or your nurse.

88
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:16,976
Good night.

89
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:20,521
Close the door
and turn off the lights, sweetie.

90
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:34,666
You have to help us.
Come up and see him.

91
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:38,137
The wound is getting worse.
His leg isn't any better.

92
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:44,078
This is all I could get.

93
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:45,304
I'm sorry.

94
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:49,210
Captain Vidal is waiting
for you in his office.

95
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,713
Come here, Ofelia.

96
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:32,158
Jesus, your feet.
They're frozen!

97
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,164
Are you afraid?

98
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:46,400
A little.

99
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:52,608
What's that noise?

100
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:55,811
Nothing, just the wind.

101
00:11:57,288 --> 00:12:00,485
Nights here are different
from city nights.

102
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:04,452
There, you hear cars-tramway.

103
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:06,861
Here the houses are old.

104
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:09,622
They creak.

105
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:13,568
As if they were speaking.

106
00:12:17,608 --> 00:12:20,042
Tomorrow, I'm going
to give you a surprise.

107
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:22,404
- A surprise?
- Yes.

108
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:28,385
- A book?
- No, something much better.

109
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,327
Why did you have to get married?

110
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:42,897
I was alone too long.

111
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:46,629
I'm with you.
You weren't alone.

112
00:12:47,672 --> 00:12:49,162
You were never alone.

113
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:55,373
When you're older, you'll understand.
It hasn't been easy for me either.

114
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:00,951
Your brother's at it again-

115
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:03,946
Tell him one of your stories.

116
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:06,184
I'm sure that'll calm down.

117
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,652
My brother, my brother...

118
00:13:17,802 --> 00:13:20,270
Many, many years ago,

119
00:13:20,638 --> 00:13:23,004
in a sad, faraway land,

120
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:26,838
there was an enormous mountain
made of rough, black stone.

121
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:29,173
At sunset,

122
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:32,111
on top of that mountain,

123
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,787
a magic rose blossomed every night
that made whoever plucked it immortal.

124
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:40,557
But no one dared go near it

125
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:44,188
because its thorns were full of poison.

126
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:57,998
Men talked amongst themselves
about their fear of death,

127
00:13:58,076 --> 00:14:02,706
and pain, but never about the promise
of eternal life.

128
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:14,624
And every day, the rose wilted
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone.

129
00:14:16,494 --> 00:14:21,090
Forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold, dark mountain,

130
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:24,826
forever alone, until the end of time.

131
00:14:37,748 --> 00:14:38,680
Come in.

132
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:43,983
- How is she?
- Very weak.

133
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:45,954
She'll have as much rest
as as she needs.

134
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:47,249
I'll sleep down here.

135
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,920
- And my son?
- Pardon?

136
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:56,063
Excuse us, Captain.

137
00:14:58,102 --> 00:15:00,161
My son, how is he?

138
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:02,838
For the moment, there's no
reason to be alarmed.

139
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:05,940
Very good.

140
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:12,839
Captain, your wife should not have
traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy.

141
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,786
- Is that your opinion?
- My professional opinion, yes, sir.

142
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,394
A son should be born
wherever his father is.

143
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:26,921
That's all.

144
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,866
One more thing, Captain.

145
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:33,894
What makes you so sure
the baby is a male?

146
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:37,174
Don't fuck with me.

147
00:15:38,976 --> 00:15:41,638
At 8 o'clock we detected movement
in the northwestern sector.

148
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,142
Gunfire.

149
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,444
Sergeant Bayona searched the area
and captured a suspect.

150
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:52,152
The other one's his son,
here from the town.

151
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:54,623
Captain, my father
is an honest man.

152
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,751
Let me judge that.
Take your hat off in front of me.

153
00:15:58,763 --> 00:16:01,425
We found this weapon on him.
It's been fired.

154
00:16:01,632 --> 00:16:03,327
My father was hunting
rabbits, Captain.

155
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:04,959
Again, keep quiet.

156
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:17,307
"No God, no country, no Master"?

157
00:16:17,782 --> 00:16:21,912
- Just like that-how do you like that?
- Red prpaganda, Captain.

158
00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:23,850
It's not propaganda, sir.

159
00:16:24,555 --> 00:16:26,853
It's an old almanac, Captain.

160
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:29,553
We're just farmers.

161
00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:31,992
Go on.

162
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:36,997
I went up into the woods, Captain.
To hunt for rabbits.

163
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:39,762
For my daughters. They're sick.

164
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:42,839
Rabbits, uh?

165
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:47,041
Captain, if my father says so,
he was hunting rabbits.

166
00:16:58,422 --> 00:17:00,117
Leave him alone.

167
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,325
You killed him,
You killed him!

168
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:09,823
Murderer!
Son of a bitch!

169
00:17:39,597 --> 00:17:41,758
Maybe you'll learn to search
these assholes properly

170
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:43,591
before you come bothering me.

171
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:45,028
Yes, Captain.

172
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:08,725
Mother.
Mother, wake up!

173
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:12,491
Mother, there's something in the room.

174
00:18:53,904 --> 00:18:54,836
Hello.

175
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:57,230
Did you follow me here?

176
00:18:58,008 --> 00:18:59,168
Are you a fairy?

177
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:02,509
Look!

178
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:09,342
This is a fairy.

179
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:38,809
You want me to go with you?

180
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:42,852
Outside? Where?

181
00:21:00,865 --> 00:21:02,526
Hello?

182
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:05,425
Hello?

183
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:25,580
Echo.

184
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:34,621
Echo.

185
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:39,594
Hello?

186
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:43,963
Hello?

187
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:47,874
It's you.

188
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:56,350
It's you.
You've returned.

189
00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:58,478
Don't be frightened,
I beg you.

190
00:21:59,823 --> 00:22:01,757
Look, look.

191
00:22:10,034 --> 00:22:12,662
My name is Ofelia.
Who are you?

192
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:13,963
Me?

193
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,008
I've had so many names...

194
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:27,207
Old names that only the wind
and the trees can pronounce.

195
00:22:27,384 --> 00:22:34,222
I am the mountain,
the forest and the earth.

196
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:36,322
I am...

197
00:22:39,797 --> 00:22:42,595
I am a faun.

198
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:47,394
Your most humble servant,
Your Highness.

199
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:51,167
- No, I'm...
- You're Princess Moanna,

200
00:22:51,275 --> 00:22:56,941
daughter of the king
of the underworld.

201
00:22:57,014 --> 00:22:58,743
My father was a tailor.

202
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:00,976
You are not born of man.

203
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:04,453
It was the moon that bore you.

204
00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:06,920
Look on your left shoulder

205
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:10,060
and you will find a mark
that proves it.

206
00:23:10,494 --> 00:23:20,460
Your real father had us open portals
all over the world to allow your return.

207
00:23:20,938 --> 00:23:22,599
This is...

208
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,834
This is the last of them.

209
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:35,078
But we have to make sure
that your essence is intact,

210
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:39,716
that you have not become a mortal.

211
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:48,925
You must complete three tasks
before the moon is full.

212
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:57,899
This is The Book of Crossroads.

213
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:01,737
Open it, when you are alone

214
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:04,780
and it will show you your future,

215
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:09,216
show you what must be done.

216
00:24:17,594 --> 00:24:19,152
But there's nothing in here.

217
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,681
Mercedes, prepare these rabbits
for dinner tonight.

218
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:22,716
They are too young.

219
00:25:23,227 --> 00:25:26,287
- Well, maybe they'll do for a stew.
- Yes, sir.

220
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:31,758
This coffee was burnt.
Taste it yourself.

221
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:43,043
You should keep an eye on it.

222
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:46,281
As you wish, sir.

223
00:25:52,823 --> 00:25:53,812
Cook these.

224
00:25:55,592 --> 00:25:58,060
- He didn't like the coffee.
- He's nothing but a fussy dandy.

225
00:25:58,195 --> 00:25:59,096
A fussy dandy!

226
00:25:59,096 --> 00:26:01,398
We're going to need some beef
and one more chicken.

227
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:05,232
- Where are we supposed to find that?
- The doctor's wife, the mayor's too.

228
00:26:05,302 --> 00:26:08,294
Well, they eat more
than a couple of pigs.

229
00:26:09,406 --> 00:26:12,967
- And they don't shut up.
- Not even underwater.

230
00:26:27,925 --> 00:26:29,950
I'll be back in a moment,
Mercedes.

231
00:26:35,065 --> 00:26:36,327
Ofelia.

232
00:26:38,902 --> 00:26:41,632
Your father is giving
a dinner party tonight.

233
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:44,872
Look what I've made for you.

234
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,504
Do you like it?

235
00:26:49,313 --> 00:26:52,305
What I wouldn't have given
to have such a dress...

236
00:26:52,449 --> 00:26:54,883
as fine as this when I was your age!

237
00:26:55,052 --> 00:26:56,178
And look at the shoes!

238
00:26:57,554 --> 00:27:00,250
- Do you like them?
- Yes, very pretty.

239
00:27:01,892 --> 00:27:03,553
Go on, now.
Take your bath.

240
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:08,914
Ofelia?

241
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:11,558
Ofelia?

242
00:28:12,996 --> 00:28:16,454
Hurry up.
I want to see the dress on you.

243
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:19,293
I want you to be beautiful
for the Captain.

244
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:23,902
You'll look like a princess.

245
00:28:28,312 --> 00:28:29,711
A princess?

246
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:37,782
Make sure those chickens
are cleaned properly.

247
00:28:37,888 --> 00:28:40,356
And don't forget the beans.

248
00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:47,962
- You look marvelous, my girl, just beautiful.
- What a gorgeous dress!

249
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,891
Get back to work,
stop wasting time.

250
00:28:55,706 --> 00:28:57,173
Do you want some milk with honey?

251
00:29:02,713 --> 00:29:06,672
Move back, we can't have you getting
milk on your dress, with you looking so pretty.

252
00:29:09,052 --> 00:29:12,988
Mercedes.
Do you believe in fairies?

253
00:29:14,124 --> 00:29:15,022
No.

254
00:29:15,826 --> 00:29:17,191
But when I was a little girl,
I did.

255
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,854
I believed in a lot of things
I don't believe any more.

256
00:29:22,265 --> 00:29:23,994
Last night,
a fairy visited me.

257
00:29:25,002 --> 00:29:26,060
Really?

258
00:29:27,304 --> 00:29:30,440
And it wasn't alone,
there were lots of them,

259
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,135
- And a faun, too.
- A faun?

260
00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:36,368
He was very old, very tall
and smelled like earth.

261
00:29:37,414 --> 00:29:40,440
My mother warned me
to be wary of fauns.

262
00:29:40,684 --> 00:29:41,742
Mercedes!

263
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:44,654
Come with me.

264
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:57,129
Captain,
everything is here.

265
00:29:57,367 --> 00:30:00,063
Flour, salt, oil, medicine,

266
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:03,365
olives, bacon.

267
00:30:04,474 --> 00:30:06,339
This-this is real tobacco.

268
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,709
And the ration cards.

269
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,411
- I need you to check the inventory.
- Very well.

270
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:15,909
Mercedes.

271
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,815
- The key.
- Yes, sir.

272
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:28,097
- Is this the only copy?
- The only one.

273
00:30:28,198 --> 00:30:29,995
From now on, I'll carry it.

274
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:31,866
Captain.

275
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:39,233
Captain,
perhaps it's nothing.

276
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:48,640
It's them.

277
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:04,391
"Once upon a time,
when the forest was young,

278
00:31:04,968 --> 00:31:10,600
they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder."

279
00:31:17,414 --> 00:31:19,746
"They protected one another,

280
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:23,213
and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree

281
00:31:23,653 --> 00:31:26,087
that grew on a hill, near the mill."

282
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,388
"But now, the tree is dying.

283
00:31:30,727 --> 00:31:34,390
Its branches are dry,
its trunk old and twisted.

284
00:31:35,198 --> 00:31:38,429
A monstrous toad
has settled in its roots

285
00:31:38,702 --> 00:31:40,169
and won't let the tree thrive.

286
00:31:41,471 --> 00:31:44,668
You must put the three magic
stones in the toad's mouth

287
00:31:45,342 --> 00:31:48,800
and retrieve the golden key
from inside his belly.

288
00:31:49,412 --> 00:31:52,575
Only then will the fig tree
flourish again."

289
00:33:19,102 --> 00:33:20,899
They were here
less than twenty minutes ago.

290
00:33:21,705 --> 00:33:23,536
They left in a hurry.

291
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,580
A dozen men, at most.

292
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:52,866
Antibiotics.

293
00:33:53,837 --> 00:33:57,000
Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket.

294
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:00,536
They're here.

295
00:34:03,513 --> 00:34:05,879
Those sons of bitches are here.

296
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,877
And they're watching us.

297
00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:20,523
Hey!

298
00:34:21,865 --> 00:34:24,356
You left this behind!

299
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:27,092
And your lottery ticket!

300
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:29,730
Why don't you come back
and get it?

301
00:34:30,473 --> 00:34:32,941
Who knows?
This could be your lucky day!

302
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,641
Hello.
I'm Princess Moanna,

303
00:35:48,017 --> 00:35:49,484
and I'm not afraid of you.

304
00:35:52,956 --> 00:35:56,187
Aren't you ashamed
living down here,

305
00:35:56,393 --> 00:35:58,418
eating all these bugs...

306
00:35:59,195 --> 00:36:02,130
and growing fat
while the tree dies?

307
00:38:45,028 --> 00:38:47,053
Have you looked in her room?
And the pantry?

308
00:38:47,196 --> 00:38:48,458
Yes, ma'am.

309
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:53,660
Have you checked the garden?

310
00:38:54,003 --> 00:38:55,800
- And the barn?
- Yes, ma'am.

311
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,231
Where is that girl?

312
00:38:58,308 --> 00:38:59,605
This way, please.

313
00:39:00,643 --> 00:39:03,635
Let me to introduce you
to my wife, Carmen.

314
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:07,380
- Charmed.
- A pleasure to meet you.

315
00:39:07,984 --> 00:39:11,283
From now on,
one ration card per family.

316
00:39:12,055 --> 00:39:13,022
Take a look.

317
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:15,351
- One?
- Only one.

318
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,922
Captain, I'm not sure
it'll be enough.

319
00:39:17,994 --> 00:39:19,325
If people are careful,
it should be plenty.

320
00:39:19,395 --> 00:39:22,592
We can't allow anyone to send food
to the guerillas in the mountains.

321
00:39:22,732 --> 00:39:26,600
They're losing ground,
and one of them is wounded.

322
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:30,206
Excuse me, Captain,
how can you be so sure?

323
00:39:30,206 --> 00:39:32,936
We almost got them.
We found this.

324
00:39:33,743 --> 00:39:34,971
Antibiotics.

325
00:39:36,212 --> 00:39:38,578
God has already
saved their souls.

326
00:39:38,848 --> 00:39:41,476
What happens to their bodies
hardly matter to Him.

327
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:44,142
We'll help however we can, Captain.

328
00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:46,414
We know you're not here by choice.

329
00:39:50,793 --> 00:39:51,851
You're wrong about that.

330
00:39:53,062 --> 00:39:56,930
I choose to be here because I want
my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.

331
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,994
Because these people
hold the mistaken belief

332
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,828
that we're all equal.

333
00:40:03,439 --> 00:40:04,906
But there's a big difference:

334
00:40:05,508 --> 00:40:08,033
The war is over and we won.

335
00:40:08,645 --> 00:40:11,580
And if we need to kill every one
of these vermin to settle it,

336
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:14,743
then we'll kill them all,
and that's that.

337
00:40:15,985 --> 00:40:17,509
We're all here by choice.

338
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:20,716
By choice!

339
00:40:23,626 --> 00:40:26,424
Put the coffee on.
I'm going for more wood.

340
00:40:26,562 --> 00:40:28,553
We'll take care of it.

341
00:40:55,558 --> 00:40:56,684
Ofelia?

342
00:41:08,705 --> 00:41:11,572
So, how did you
and the Captain meet?

343
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,808
Ofelia's father used to make
the Captain's uniforms.

344
00:41:16,946 --> 00:41:17,913
Oh, I see...

345
00:41:18,448 --> 00:41:22,646
And after he died,
I went to work at the shop.

346
00:41:22,785 --> 00:41:24,980
A little more than a year ago,

347
00:41:25,888 --> 00:41:29,688
the Captain and I met again.

348
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:31,349
Curious, isn't it!

349
00:41:31,627 --> 00:41:34,596
I mean, finding each other again?

350
00:41:36,132 --> 00:41:38,794
Oh, yes,
very, very curious.

351
00:41:39,068 --> 00:41:42,765
Please, forgive my wife.
She hasn't been exposed to the world.

352
00:41:43,272 --> 00:41:45,502
She thinks these silly stories
are interesting to others.

353
00:41:46,676 --> 00:41:48,200
We understand.

354
00:41:50,613 --> 00:41:52,774
Excuse me, madam
Ofelia is here.

355
00:41:53,516 --> 00:41:54,915
Excuse me.

356
00:42:05,862 --> 00:42:08,057
Have I told you that I was acquainted
with your father, Captain?

357
00:42:09,232 --> 00:42:10,699
No.
I had no idea.

358
00:42:13,436 --> 00:42:14,926
In Morocco.

359
00:42:15,338 --> 00:42:18,307
I knew him only briefly,
but he left a great impression.

360
00:42:18,374 --> 00:42:19,568
An excellent soldier.

361
00:42:20,042 --> 00:42:24,342
The men in his battalion said that
when General Vidal died on the battlefield,

362
00:42:25,148 --> 00:42:26,809
he smashed his watch on a rock

363
00:42:27,016 --> 00:42:29,507
so that his son would know
the exact hour and minute of his death.

364
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,952
So he would know
how a brave man dies.

365
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:38,550
Nonsense.
He didn't own a watch.

366
00:42:40,163 --> 00:42:43,360
What you've done hurts me.

367
00:42:44,901 --> 00:42:47,495
After your bath,
you'll go to bed without supper.

368
00:42:49,505 --> 00:42:50,597
Are you listening?

369
00:42:54,076 --> 00:42:56,840
Sometimes I think
you'll never learn to behave.

370
00:42:57,713 --> 00:42:59,704
You've disappointed me, Ofelia.

371
00:43:01,784 --> 00:43:03,183
And your father, too.

372
00:43:04,654 --> 00:43:05,916
You mean the Captain?

373
00:43:07,056 --> 00:43:08,353
Him more than me.

374
00:43:23,806 --> 00:43:25,239
I've got the key.

375
00:43:28,978 --> 00:43:30,605
Take me to the Labyrinth.

376
00:44:23,866 --> 00:44:24,855
Hello.

377
00:44:26,669 --> 00:44:28,466
I got the key out.

378
00:44:29,538 --> 00:44:34,407
That's me,
and the girl is you.

379
00:44:34,744 --> 00:44:35,938
And the baby?

380
00:44:37,313 --> 00:44:39,543
So... you retrieved the key.

381
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:43,580
I'm glad.

382
00:44:52,228 --> 00:44:56,528
She believed in you
from the very beginning.

383
00:44:56,899 --> 00:44:59,595
She's so glad you succeeded.

384
00:45:05,641 --> 00:45:07,040
Keep the key.

385
00:45:07,476 --> 00:45:10,639
You'll be needing it very soon.

386
00:45:10,813 --> 00:45:15,716
And this too?
A piece of chalk.

387
00:45:17,153 --> 00:45:20,423
Two tasks remain

388
00:45:20,423 --> 00:45:25,258
and the moon is almost full.

389
00:45:25,361 --> 00:45:27,158
Be patient.

390
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:36,134
We'll soon stroll through
the seven circular gardens of your palace.

391
00:45:36,238 --> 00:45:38,763
How do I know
that what you say is true?

392
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:45,014
Why would a poor little faun
like me lie to you?

393
00:46:07,136 --> 00:46:08,330
Proceed.

394
00:46:09,372 --> 00:46:11,806
Have your cards
ready for inspection.

395
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:14,601
Let's go.
Your name?

396
00:46:18,347 --> 00:46:19,837
Your names, first and last.

397
00:46:20,316 --> 00:46:24,480
Narciso Pena Soriano,
at your service.

398
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,220
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain,

399
00:46:30,459 --> 00:46:34,555
kept safe in this mill!
The Reds lie...

400
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,591
because in a united Spain,

401
00:46:36,766 --> 00:46:40,463
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

402
00:46:54,683 --> 00:46:58,244
Come on, show me
what happens now?

403
00:46:58,754 --> 00:46:59,778
Show me.

404
00:47:37,827 --> 00:47:39,419
Ofelia, help me...

405
00:47:45,267 --> 00:47:47,132
Captain! Captain!

406
00:47:49,705 --> 00:47:51,263
Come quickly.

407
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,104
...because in a united Spain,

408
00:47:53,209 --> 00:47:57,077
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

409
00:47:57,546 --> 00:47:59,878
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain...

410
00:48:02,785 --> 00:48:05,754
Your wife needs
uninterrupted rest.

411
00:48:07,623 --> 00:48:10,524
She'll have to be sedated
most of the time.

412
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:15,093
The girl should sleep
somewhere else.

413
00:48:16,866 --> 00:48:18,925
I'll stay here until the birth.

414
00:48:19,401 --> 00:48:20,368
Make her well.

415
00:48:21,704 --> 00:48:23,729
I don't care what it costs
or what you need.

416
00:48:28,444 --> 00:48:29,138
Make her well.

417
00:48:50,466 --> 00:48:51,933
Don't worry.

418
00:48:53,102 --> 00:48:55,593
Your mother will get better soon,
you'll see.

419
00:48:58,974 --> 00:49:00,601
Having a baby is complicated.

420
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:04,573
Then I'll never have one.

421
00:49:17,126 --> 00:49:19,959
You're helping the men
in the woods, aren't you?

422
00:49:31,607 --> 00:49:32,938
Have you told anyone?

423
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:35,636
No, I haven't.

424
00:49:37,846 --> 00:49:39,939
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

425
00:49:50,859 --> 00:49:52,121
Nor I to you.

426
00:49:53,662 --> 00:49:55,789
Do you know a lullaby?

427
00:49:57,766 --> 00:49:58,994
Only one...

428
00:50:00,135 --> 00:50:02,160
but I don't remember the words.

429
00:50:02,471 --> 00:50:06,066
I don't care.
I still want to hear it.

430
00:50:59,428 --> 00:51:02,192
Don't be afraid.
It's only me.

431
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,108
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

432
00:51:14,276 --> 00:51:15,402
Then let's go.

433
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:21,883
This is sheer madness.

434
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:24,685
When that man finds out about us,
he'll kill us all.

435
00:51:25,187 --> 00:51:28,315
- Have you thought about that?
- Are you so afraid of him, Doctor?

436
00:51:28,724 --> 00:51:30,692
It's not fear...

437
00:51:31,293 --> 00:51:32,658
at least not for myself.

438
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,839
Pedro!

439
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:48,575
Pedro, My brother!

440
00:52:05,227 --> 00:52:07,388
You didn't carry out the task.

441
00:52:07,529 --> 00:52:10,828
No, my mother is sick.

442
00:52:12,368 --> 00:52:14,962
That's no excuse
for negligence.

443
00:52:15,237 --> 00:52:20,106
Look...
this is a mandrake root.

444
00:52:20,209 --> 00:52:24,077
A plant that dreamt
of being human.

445
00:52:25,013 --> 00:52:29,677
Put it under your mother's bed

446
00:52:30,052 --> 00:52:33,283
in a bowl of fresh milk.

447
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:38,849
Each morning,
give it two drops of blood.

448
00:52:39,294 --> 00:52:43,355
Now, we have no time
to waste.

449
00:52:43,665 --> 00:52:46,429
The full moon will be upon us.

450
00:52:48,804 --> 00:52:51,272
Take my pets
to guide you through.

451
00:52:51,874 --> 00:52:57,471
You're going to a very dangerous
place, so be careful.

452
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:00,443
The thing that slumbers there,

453
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,875
it is not human.

454
00:53:07,723 --> 00:53:11,989
You will see
a sumptuous feast,

455
00:53:12,094 --> 00:53:14,892
but don't eat
or drink anything.

456
00:53:15,097 --> 00:53:19,830
Absolutely nothing.

457
00:53:21,503 --> 00:53:25,030
Your life depends on it.

458
00:53:45,694 --> 00:53:50,654
I've brought some Orujo,
tobacco, cheese.

459
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:53,732
Mail for Trigo and Piloto.

460
00:53:55,804 --> 00:53:57,772
Let's see how that leg's doing,
Frenchie.

461
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,776
How do you think it's doing?
It's fucked up.

462
00:54:02,244 --> 00:54:03,836
Let's see.

463
00:54:06,915 --> 00:54:10,180
...N- North American,

464
00:54:11,553 --> 00:54:14,215
British and Canadian troops

465
00:54:14,323 --> 00:54:17,850
disembarked on a small beach
in the North of F-F.

466
00:54:18,694 --> 00:54:21,390
- "France", idiot.
- F-f-f-rance.

467
00:54:21,797 --> 00:54:24,288
More than 150,000 soldiers
give us hope...

468
00:54:24,533 --> 00:54:29,334
under the command
of General Dwight D. Eisenhower...

469
00:54:29,538 --> 00:54:32,507
Is it really bad, doctor?

470
00:54:33,542 --> 00:54:35,169
Look, Frenchie.

471
00:54:36,445 --> 00:54:38,003
There's no way to save it.

472
00:54:49,892 --> 00:54:53,191
I'll try to make it
in as few cuts as possible.

473
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:04,370
Wait a second, doctor,
just a second.

474
00:55:39,474 --> 00:55:45,640
"Use the chalk to trace a door
anywhere in your room."

475
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:54,778
"Once the door's open,
start the hourglass."

476
00:55:57,092 --> 00:55:59,219
"Let the fairies guide you."

477
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,933
"Don't eat or drink anything,
during your stay,

478
00:56:08,286 --> 00:56:12,848
And come back
before the last grain of sand falls."

479
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:22,843
No...

480
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:26,884
This other one.

481
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,407
No! No!

482
01:02:20,224 --> 01:02:22,124
We'll soon have reinforcements
from Jaca.

483
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:26,462
Fifty men or more.
Then we'll go head to head with Vidal.

484
01:02:27,498 --> 01:02:29,989
And then what?

485
01:02:30,701 --> 01:02:34,398
You kill him, they'll send another
just like him. And another...

486
01:02:34,972 --> 01:02:38,203
You're screwed, no guns,
no safe shelter...

487
01:02:38,309 --> 01:02:42,541
You need food, medicine.
You must take care of Mercedes.

488
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,509
If you really love her,
you'd cross the border with her.

489
01:02:44,582 --> 01:02:47,016
- This is a lost cause.
- I'm staying here, doctor.

490
01:02:47,351 --> 01:02:48,318
There's no choice.

491
01:03:00,731 --> 01:03:01,891
You have to leave.

492
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:06,602
Here's the key,
but you can't go down there now.

493
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:09,101
It's exactly what he expects.

494
01:03:12,276 --> 01:03:13,243
Leave it to me.

495
01:03:17,314 --> 01:03:18,440
I'm a coward.

496
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:22,075
No, you're not.

497
01:03:23,254 --> 01:03:24,482
Yes, I am.

498
01:03:25,122 --> 01:03:29,559
A coward... for living
next to that son of a bitch,

499
01:03:30,861 --> 01:03:33,659
doing his laundry, making his bed,
feeding him.

500
01:03:37,368 --> 01:03:39,859
What if the doctor's right
and we can't win?

501
01:03:44,175 --> 01:03:46,405
At least we'll make things
harder for that bastard.

502
01:05:41,292 --> 01:05:42,259
Captain Vidal...

503
01:05:44,361 --> 01:05:46,886
Her temperature's down.
I don't know how, but it is.

504
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:48,630
But she still has a fever?

505
01:05:49,266 --> 01:05:52,167
Yes, but it's a good sign.
Her body is responding.

506
01:05:53,971 --> 01:05:54,938
Listen to me.

507
01:05:55,606 --> 01:05:58,632
If you have to choose,
save the baby.

508
01:05:58,809 --> 01:06:01,334
That boy will bear my name
and my father's name.

509
01:06:01,478 --> 01:06:02,467
Save him.

510
01:06:38,482 --> 01:06:39,449
Brother...

511
01:06:41,452 --> 01:06:42,384
Little brother...

512
01:06:44,621 --> 01:06:46,145
If you can hear me,

513
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:49,418
things out here aren't too good.

514
01:06:51,295 --> 01:06:53,286
But soon you'll have to come out.

515
01:06:54,565 --> 01:06:56,192
You've made Mama very sick.

516
01:06:58,402 --> 01:07:02,031
I want to ask you one favor
for when you come out,

517
01:07:03,173 --> 01:07:04,299
just one:

518
01:07:05,642 --> 01:07:07,303
Don't hurt her.

519
01:07:08,512 --> 01:07:11,743
You'll meet her,
she's very pretty,

520
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:14,847
even though sometimes she's sad
for days at a time.

521
01:07:15,953 --> 01:07:17,818
You'll see, when she smiles,

522
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,913
you'll love her.

523
01:07:23,293 --> 01:07:26,592
Listen, if you do what I say,

524
01:07:26,897 --> 01:07:28,455
I'll make you a promise,

525
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:33,029
I'll take you to my kingdom,
and I'll make you a prince.

526
01:07:34,037 --> 01:07:37,200
I promise you, a prince.

527
01:08:03,867 --> 01:08:06,392
I sounded the whistle,
but they wouldn't move.

528
01:08:06,603 --> 01:08:09,003
I tried to stop, but it was too late.

529
01:08:09,072 --> 01:08:11,506
The fireman and I
jumped outjust in time,

530
01:08:11,742 --> 01:08:13,141
but look at the mess they made.

531
01:08:16,313 --> 01:08:18,042
What did they steal
from the freight cars?

532
01:08:18,549 --> 01:08:20,346
They didn't open a single one.

533
01:08:20,617 --> 01:08:22,050
What the hell are you talking about?

534
01:08:22,186 --> 01:08:24,484
This whole mess...
They didn't open any of the cars.

535
01:08:24,688 --> 01:08:28,988
- They didn't take anything.
- Nothing? Are you sure?

536
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,227
God only knows what they wanted,
other than to waste our time.

537
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,843
They came out of nowhere, Captain.

538
01:08:55,185 --> 01:08:58,348
They have grenades,
they went up hill.

539
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,858
Captain, we've surrounded
a small unit that fell behind.

540
01:09:06,096 --> 01:09:07,688
They took cover up on the hill.

541
01:09:42,766 --> 01:09:47,260
Go ahead, Serrano, don't be afraid,
this is the only decent way to die.

542
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:32,175
Serrano!

543
01:10:49,399 --> 01:10:52,425
Let me see.

544
01:10:57,174 --> 01:10:58,266
Can you talk?

545
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:03,646
Damn it!

546
01:11:22,232 --> 01:11:24,826
These are useless! They can't talk.

547
01:11:34,144 --> 01:11:36,806
Captain,
this one's still alive.

548
01:11:40,884 --> 01:11:42,249
Shot in the leg.

549
01:11:48,191 --> 01:11:49,556
- What's happened?
- They caught one.

550
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:52,026
They took one of them alive.
And they're taking him to the storeroom.

551
01:11:57,234 --> 01:11:58,360
Mercedes!

552
01:11:59,202 --> 01:12:01,432
Pedro... Pedro...

553
01:12:18,889 --> 01:12:19,856
Mercedes?

554
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:23,783
- I need to get into the storeroom.
- Not now.

555
01:12:24,294 --> 01:12:25,625
Move away!

556
01:12:52,723 --> 01:12:54,953
That's plenty, dear.

557
01:12:58,528 --> 01:13:00,018
Should I take this up?

558
01:13:19,883 --> 01:13:22,351
Here, half the dose.

559
01:13:22,853 --> 01:13:24,650
I don't think I need it.

560
01:13:24,955 --> 01:13:27,947
I feel better, much better.

561
01:13:28,225 --> 01:13:30,625
I don't understand.
But I'm glad.

562
01:13:33,964 --> 01:13:34,555
Mother...

563
01:13:49,312 --> 01:13:52,076
Damn, this cigarette is good!

564
01:13:52,849 --> 01:13:56,250
Real tobacco hard to find.

565
01:13:57,888 --> 01:14:00,288
G-G-Go to hell.

566
01:14:02,959 --> 01:14:06,952
Damn, Garces. We catch one
and he turns out to be a stutterer.

567
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:09,357
We'll be here all night.

568
01:14:09,566 --> 01:14:11,534
As long as he talks.

569
01:14:17,407 --> 01:14:19,238
Garces is right.

570
01:14:20,076 --> 01:14:22,374
You'd do better
to tell us everything.

571
01:14:23,079 --> 01:14:26,446
But to make sure it happens,
I brought along a few tools.

572
01:14:28,785 --> 01:14:30,980
Just things you pick up
along the way.

573
01:14:31,188 --> 01:14:33,622
At first, I won't be able to trust you,

574
01:14:34,191 --> 01:14:37,649
but after I use this,
you'll own up to a few things.

575
01:14:39,696 --> 01:14:41,163
When we get to these,

576
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:45,862
we'll have developed...
how can I put this-?

577
01:14:46,269 --> 01:14:48,863
A closer bond,
much like brothers.

578
01:14:50,307 --> 01:14:51,831
You'll see.

579
01:14:53,844 --> 01:14:55,505
And when we get to this one,

580
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,314
I'll believe anything you tell me.

581
01:15:11,628 --> 01:15:12,925
I'll make you a deal.

582
01:15:12,996 --> 01:15:16,523
If you can count to three
without st-t-tuttering,

583
01:15:16,867 --> 01:15:18,061
you can go.

584
01:15:20,237 --> 01:15:23,172
Don't look at him, look at me.

585
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,203
Above me, there's no one.

586
01:15:25,742 --> 01:15:27,642
- Garces!
- Yes, Captain?

587
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:31,438
If I say this asshole can leave,
would anybody contradict me?

588
01:15:31,514 --> 01:15:33,141
No one, Captain.
He can leave.

589
01:15:33,884 --> 01:15:38,014
There you have it.
Count to three.

590
01:15:54,404 --> 01:15:57,032
- One.
- Good.

591
01:16:01,278 --> 01:16:02,245
Two.

592
01:16:04,014 --> 01:16:06,915
One more and you will be free.

593
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:24,800
Shame.

594
01:16:36,713 --> 01:16:40,740
Your mother is much better,
Your Highness.

595
01:16:42,185 --> 01:16:48,249
Surely, you must be relieved.

596
01:16:48,758 --> 01:16:50,851
Yes, thank you.

597
01:16:51,261 --> 01:16:54,719
But things haven't turned out so well.

598
01:16:55,632 --> 01:16:56,724
No?

599
01:16:58,535 --> 01:17:02,164
- I had an accident.
- An accident?

600
01:17:02,339 --> 01:17:03,306
Yes.

601
01:17:12,582 --> 01:17:15,483
- You broke the rules!
- It was only two grapes!

602
01:17:15,585 --> 01:17:17,177
I thought no one would notice.

603
01:17:18,588 --> 01:17:21,682
- We've made a mistake!
- A mistake?

604
01:17:22,425 --> 01:17:26,156
You failed.
You can never return.

605
01:17:26,262 --> 01:17:29,925
- It was an accident!
- You cannot return.

606
01:17:30,033 --> 01:17:33,992
The moon will be full in three days.

607
01:17:34,571 --> 01:17:40,271
Your spirit shall forever remain
among the humans.

608
01:17:40,377 --> 01:17:44,245
You shall age like them,
you shall die like them

609
01:17:44,314 --> 01:17:48,410
and all memory of you
shall fade in time.

610
01:17:48,985 --> 01:17:52,978
And we'll vanish along with it.

611
01:17:53,623 --> 01:17:57,423
You will never see us again.

612
01:18:08,138 --> 01:18:11,869
Good day, doctor.
Sorry to wake you so early,

613
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:14,338
but I think we need your help.

614
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:39,225
My God, what have you done to him?

615
01:18:39,402 --> 01:18:40,528
Not much.

616
01:18:42,472 --> 01:18:44,269
But things are getting better.

617
01:18:52,182 --> 01:18:56,915
I like having you handy, Doctor.
It has its advantages.

618
01:18:58,455 --> 01:18:59,922
Serrano, stay here.

619
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:01,148
I talked.

620
01:19:02,559 --> 01:19:03,787
Not much.

621
01:19:06,162 --> 01:19:09,598
- B-b-but I talked.
- I'm sorry.

622
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:11,925
I'm so sorry.

623
01:19:19,075 --> 01:19:24,206
Kill me.
Kill me now, please.

624
01:19:40,396 --> 01:19:41,988
Son of a bitch.

625
01:20:03,086 --> 01:20:05,020
It'll take away the pain.

626
01:20:11,394 --> 01:20:12,861
It's almost over.

627
01:20:21,604 --> 01:20:22,935
Watch Dr. Ferreiro,

628
01:20:23,072 --> 01:20:24,539
- I'll be right there.
- Yes, Captain.

629
01:20:48,097 --> 01:20:49,689
You're not moving anymore.

630
01:20:51,201 --> 01:20:52,634
Are you sick?

631
01:20:55,838 --> 01:20:58,363
What are you doing down there?

632
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:13,616
- Call him!
- Who?

633
01:21:13,723 --> 01:21:16,123
Who else, you imbecile?
Ferreiro!

634
01:21:40,216 --> 01:21:42,309
What the hell is this?

635
01:21:45,388 --> 01:21:46,980
No! No, no!

636
01:21:47,223 --> 01:21:50,818
Leave her.
Leave her alone, please!

637
01:21:52,528 --> 01:21:55,088
Look at this! Look what she
was hiding under your bed!

638
01:21:55,498 --> 01:21:56,692
What do you think of this?

639
01:22:01,304 --> 01:22:05,798
Ofelia, what is this thing doing
under the bed?

640
01:22:06,009 --> 01:22:09,945
It's a magic root
the faun gave me.

641
01:22:10,113 --> 01:22:12,707
This is all because of thatjunk
you let her read.

642
01:22:13,049 --> 01:22:14,016
Look what you've done!

643
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:18,211
Please, leave us alone.
I'll talk to her, darling.

644
01:22:18,855 --> 01:22:21,790
Fine.
As you wish.

645
01:22:23,593 --> 01:22:26,289
He told me you would get better.
And you did.

646
01:22:26,562 --> 01:22:29,463
Ofelia, you have to listen
to your father.

647
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,892
You have to stop all this.

648
01:22:32,568 --> 01:22:35,196
No. I want to leave this place!

649
01:22:35,538 --> 01:22:38,701
Please, take me away from here!
Let's just go, Please!

650
01:22:38,841 --> 01:22:41,139
Things are not that simple.

651
01:22:43,379 --> 01:22:45,210
You're getting older,

652
01:22:46,249 --> 01:22:49,616
soon you'll see that life
isn't like your fairy tales.

653
01:22:50,219 --> 01:22:52,414
The world is a cruel place.

654
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:57,521
And you'll learn that,
even if it hurts.

655
01:22:59,128 --> 01:23:01,653
- No! No!
- Ofelia!

656
01:23:02,999 --> 01:23:07,959
Magic does not exist.
Not for you, me or anyone else.

657
01:23:19,782 --> 01:23:22,046
Mom! Help!

658
01:23:22,518 --> 01:23:23,951
Help!

659
01:23:24,821 --> 01:23:26,083
Help!

660
01:23:32,128 --> 01:23:33,095
Why did you do it?

661
01:23:35,431 --> 01:23:37,092
It was the only thing I could do.

662
01:23:38,434 --> 01:23:40,664
No. You could have obeyed me.

663
01:23:42,438 --> 01:23:44,702
I could have, but I didn't.

664
01:23:46,642 --> 01:23:49,167
It would have been better for you.
You know it.

665
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:53,549
I don't understand.
Why didn't you obey me?

666
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:59,982
To obey-just like that-for the sake
of obeying, without questioning...

667
01:24:01,724 --> 01:24:04,716
that's something only people
like you can do, Captain.

668
01:24:42,165 --> 01:24:43,496
Captain!

669
01:24:49,806 --> 01:24:52,172
Garces! Call the troop paramedic.

670
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:54,866
- Get up immediately!
- Yes, Captain.

671
01:25:29,512 --> 01:25:31,377
Your wife is dead.

672
01:25:41,057 --> 01:25:44,549
Because the paths to the Lord
are inscrutable.

673
01:25:45,027 --> 01:25:46,892
Because the essence
of His forgiveness

674
01:25:46,963 --> 01:25:50,296
lies in His word
and in His mystery.

675
01:25:51,167 --> 01:25:54,159
Because although God
sends us the message,

676
01:25:54,303 --> 01:25:56,931
it is our task to decipher it.

677
01:25:57,807 --> 01:25:59,638
Because when we open our arms

678
01:25:59,809 --> 01:26:04,678
the earth takes in only a hollow
and senseless shell.

679
01:26:06,048 --> 01:26:08,983
Far away now is the soul
in its eternal glory.

680
01:26:09,585 --> 01:26:13,248
Because it is in pain
that we find the meaning of life.

681
01:26:14,056 --> 01:26:16,991
And the state of grace
that we lose when we are born.

682
01:26:18,327 --> 01:26:23,594
Because God, in His infinite wisdom,
puts the solution in our hands.

683
01:26:27,670 --> 01:26:30,161
And because it is only
in His physical absence,

684
01:26:30,339 --> 01:26:34,605
that the place He occupies
in our souls is reaffirmed.

685
01:26:56,566 --> 01:27:00,058
You knew
Dr. Ferreiro pretty well,
didn't you, Mercedes?

686
01:27:01,137 --> 01:27:04,072
We all knew him, sir.
Everyone around here.

687
01:27:06,042 --> 01:27:09,671
The stutterer spoke of an informer.
Here... at the mill.

688
01:27:10,846 --> 01:27:14,714
Can you imagine?
Right under my nose.

689
01:27:16,552 --> 01:27:19,988
Mercedes, please.

690
01:27:29,732 --> 01:27:31,165
What must you think of me?

691
01:27:32,435 --> 01:27:34,027
You must think that
I'm a monster.

692
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:37,471
It doesn't matter
what someone like me thinks, sir.

693
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:50,551
I want you to the storehouse
and bring me some more liquor, please.

694
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:54,017
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, sir.

695
01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:58,549
Mercedes,
aren't you forgetting something?

696
01:27:59,595 --> 01:28:00,584
Sir?

697
01:28:05,635 --> 01:28:06,533
The key.

698
01:28:07,570 --> 01:28:09,902
I do have the only copy, don't I?

699
01:28:11,107 --> 01:28:12,096
Yes, sir.

700
01:28:13,643 --> 01:28:17,636
You know, there's an odd detail
that's been bothering me.

701
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:19,914
Maybe it's not important, but...

702
01:28:20,182 --> 01:28:21,774
the day they broke into
the storehouse,

703
01:28:22,018 --> 01:28:24,350
with all those grenades
and explosives,

704
01:28:25,254 --> 01:28:26,744
the lock itself wasn't forced.

705
01:28:29,058 --> 01:28:32,653
As I said, it's probably
not important.

706
01:28:36,265 --> 01:28:37,562
Be very careful.

707
01:28:39,669 --> 01:28:40,897
Good night, sir.

708
01:29:23,746 --> 01:29:26,510
Ofelia, Ofelia!

709
01:29:26,782 --> 01:29:28,807
Ofelia, I'm leaving tonight.

710
01:29:29,351 --> 01:29:32,843
- Where to?
- I can't tell you. I can't tell you...

711
01:29:32,955 --> 01:29:35,981
- Take me with you.
- No, no. I can't.

712
01:29:36,092 --> 01:29:39,118
I can't, my child. But I'll come
back for you, I promise.

713
01:29:39,261 --> 01:29:40,387
Take me with you.

714
01:30:05,287 --> 01:30:06,584
I heard something.

715
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:14,723
It's nothing, don't worry.

716
01:30:24,073 --> 01:30:25,062
Mercedes.

717
01:30:27,243 --> 01:30:28,210
Ofelia.

718
01:30:37,219 --> 01:30:38,846
How long have
you known about her?

719
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:45,818
How long have you been
laughing at me?

720
01:30:46,061 --> 01:30:47,255
Little bitch!

721
01:30:48,597 --> 01:30:49,859
Watch her!

722
01:30:53,335 --> 01:30:55,064
And if anyone tries to get in,

723
01:30:56,038 --> 01:30:57,630
kill her first.

724
01:31:11,954 --> 01:31:12,921
Dry meat.

725
01:31:16,525 --> 01:31:17,514
Tobacco.

726
01:31:18,828 --> 01:31:21,592
If you had asked for it, I would have
given this to you, Mercedes.

727
01:31:28,804 --> 01:31:31,034
I want the names of whoever
wrote these letters.

728
01:31:32,775 --> 01:31:34,936
And I want them
in front of me, tomorrow.

729
01:31:35,311 --> 01:31:36,335
Yes, Captain.

730
01:31:39,215 --> 01:31:40,682
You can go, Garces.

731
01:31:42,251 --> 01:31:43,650
You're sure, Captain?

732
01:31:46,088 --> 01:31:48,852
For God's sake,
she's just a woman.

733
01:31:52,828 --> 01:31:54,989
That's what you've always thought.

734
01:31:56,165 --> 01:31:58,963
That's why I was able to get away with it.

735
01:31:59,201 --> 01:32:03,865
- I was invisible to you.
- Damn.

736
01:32:04,707 --> 01:32:08,507
You've found my weakness:
Pride.

737
01:32:09,912 --> 01:32:13,245
But it's your weak points
we're interested in.

738
01:32:15,618 --> 01:32:18,553
It's very simple: You will talk...

739
01:32:20,256 --> 01:32:21,280
And I have to know

740
01:32:23,259 --> 01:32:24,556
that everything you say is the truth.

741
01:32:25,794 --> 01:32:30,060
We have a few things here
strictly for that purpose.

742
01:32:32,001 --> 01:32:33,263
Nothing complicated.

743
01:32:36,105 --> 01:32:37,629
Things we learn on the job.

744
01:32:39,742 --> 01:32:41,710
At first...

745
01:32:58,827 --> 01:33:02,058
I'm not some old man!
Not a wounded prisoner!

746
01:33:02,131 --> 01:33:06,192
Mother Fucker!
Don't you dare touch the girl?

747
01:33:06,435 --> 01:33:08,198
Won't be the first pig I gutted.

748
01:33:31,694 --> 01:33:32,786
Look! He let her go.

749
01:33:35,297 --> 01:33:36,594
The fuck did you say?

750
01:33:44,606 --> 01:33:47,302
Get her!
Come on! Bring her to me!

751
01:33:47,743 --> 01:33:49,574
Bring her to me, damn it!

752
01:33:49,712 --> 01:33:51,202
Mount up!

753
01:34:54,143 --> 01:34:56,634
Lt'll be better if you come
with me without struggling.

754
01:34:57,279 --> 01:34:59,304
The Captain said that if you behave...

755
01:35:03,952 --> 01:35:05,715
Don't be a fool, sweetheart.

756
01:35:06,088 --> 01:35:07,646
If anyone's going to kill you...

757
01:35:09,758 --> 01:35:10,952
I'd rather it be me.

758
01:36:21,330 --> 01:36:26,267
I've decided to give you
one last chance.

759
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:33,235
Do you promise to do what I say?

760
01:36:35,244 --> 01:36:39,476
Will you do everything I tell you,
without question?

761
01:36:41,283 --> 01:36:44,252
This is your last chance.

762
01:36:45,387 --> 01:36:48,515
Then listen to me.

763
01:36:48,957 --> 01:36:51,357
Fetch your brother

764
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,422
and bring him to the labyrinth,

765
01:36:54,563 --> 01:36:58,966
as quickly as you can,
Your Highness.

766
01:36:59,201 --> 01:37:00,532
My brother?

767
01:37:00,769 --> 01:37:02,100
We need him.

768
01:37:02,237 --> 01:37:05,297
- But...
- No more questions.

769
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:09,868
The door's locked.

770
01:37:10,879 --> 01:37:16,784
In that case,
create your own door.

771
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:06,853
Captain, with your permission.

772
01:40:10,225 --> 01:40:11,249
Come quickly.

773
01:40:12,027 --> 01:40:15,292
- Now what?
- Serrano is back. He's wounded.

774
01:40:16,264 --> 01:40:17,629
Wounded?

775
01:41:03,845 --> 01:41:05,244
Where's Garces?

776
01:41:12,721 --> 01:41:13,710
How many were there?

777
01:41:14,256 --> 01:41:16,486
I don't know exactly, Captain.

778
01:41:16,925 --> 01:41:18,415
Fifty men, at least.

779
01:41:18,527 --> 01:41:22,122
The rest of the men didn't make it.
Our watch posts are not responding.

780
01:41:22,264 --> 01:41:25,859
- How many men we have left?
- Twenty, maybe less, sir.

781
01:41:36,678 --> 01:41:40,045
We're leaving.
Together.

782
01:41:41,082 --> 01:41:42,344
Don't be afraid.

783
01:41:43,218 --> 01:41:44,879
Nothing is going to happen to you.

784
01:41:51,259 --> 01:41:52,886
Put them on picket duty
at the tree line.

785
01:41:53,028 --> 01:41:55,155
If the rest of the squad gets back,
have it report immediately to me.

786
01:41:55,397 --> 01:41:58,889
Radio for reinforcements, now.

787
01:41:59,067 --> 01:42:00,364
Yes, Captain.

788
01:42:27,195 --> 01:42:28,423
Leave him!

789
01:43:14,509 --> 01:43:15,771
Ofelia!

790
01:44:42,931 --> 01:44:45,627
Quickly, Your Majesty,

791
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:48,425
give him to me.

792
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:52,064
The full moon is high in the sky,

793
01:44:52,173 --> 01:44:55,006
we can open the portal.

794
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:57,537
Why is that in your hand?

795
01:44:59,047 --> 01:45:03,950
The portal will only open
if we offer the blood of an innocent.

796
01:45:04,252 --> 01:45:08,689
Just a drop of blood.
A pinprick, that's all.

797
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:11,384
It's the final task.

798
01:45:11,693 --> 01:45:13,024
Hurry.

799
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:18,824
You promised to obey me!

800
01:45:19,267 --> 01:45:21,497
- Give me the boy!
- No!

801
01:45:22,103 --> 01:45:24,230
My brother stays with me.

802
01:45:24,472 --> 01:45:30,377
You would give up your sacred rights
for this brat you barely know?

803
01:45:30,445 --> 01:45:33,243
Yes, I would.

804
01:45:34,549 --> 01:45:37,017
You would give up
your throne for him?

805
01:45:37,152 --> 01:45:41,748
He who has caused you
such misery, such humiliation?

806
01:45:42,290 --> 01:45:45,157
Yes, I would.

807
01:45:49,264 --> 01:45:54,964
As you wish, Your Highness.

808
01:46:10,685 --> 01:46:11,709
No!

809
01:47:10,411 --> 01:47:11,400
My son.

810
01:47:39,007 --> 01:47:40,668
Tell my son...

811
01:47:46,514 --> 01:47:48,607
Tell him what time his father died.

812
01:47:49,417 --> 01:47:50,714
- Tell him that I...
- No.

813
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:53,683
He won't even know your name.

814
01:49:36,524 --> 01:49:38,549
Arise, my daughter.

815
01:49:41,863 --> 01:49:43,125
Come.

816
01:50:09,357 --> 01:50:10,585
Father.

817
01:50:11,092 --> 01:50:14,721
You have spilled your own blood
rather than that of an innocent.

818
01:50:15,496 --> 01:50:19,330
That was the final task,
and the most important.

819
01:50:29,844 --> 01:50:35,111
And you chose well,
Your Highness.

820
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:37,011
Come here with me,

821
01:50:37,885 --> 01:50:40,012
and sit by your father's side.

822
01:50:40,488 --> 01:50:42,683
He's been waiting for you so long.

823
01:51:35,610 --> 01:51:39,376
And it is said the princess
returned to her father's kingdom.

824
01:51:40,314 --> 01:51:45,650
That she reigned there with justice
and a kind heart for many centuries.

825
01:51:46,554 --> 01:51:48,818
That she was loved by her people.

826
01:51:49,090 --> 01:51:53,789
And that she left behind
small traces of her time on earth,

827
01:51:54,896 --> 01:51:59,731
visible only to those
who know where to look.
