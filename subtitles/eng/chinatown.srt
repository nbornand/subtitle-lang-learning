2
00:02:35,152 --> 00:02:36,946
<i>All right, Curly, enough's enough.</i>

3
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:41,699
You can't eat the Venetian blinds.
I just had them installed on Wednesday.

4
00:02:57,965 --> 00:02:59,549
Down the hatch.

5
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,688
<i>- She's no good.
- What can I tell you, kid? You're right.</i>

6
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:16,439
<i>When you're right, you're right.</i>

7
00:03:16,565 --> 00:03:18,232
And you're right.

8
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,318
I'll pay you the rest next week.

9
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:24,280
We only caught 60 tonne of skipjack
down in San Benedict.

10
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:27,574
And they don't pay you the same
for skipjack as they do albacore or tuna.

11
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:28,908
<i>Forget it, will you, Curly?</i>

12
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:32,328
I only brought it up to illustrate a point.
I don't want your last dime.

13
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:34,664
What kind of a guy do you think I am?

14
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:37,166
<i>- Thank you, Mr. Gittes.
- Call me Jake.</i>

15
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,710
<i>Careful driving home, Curl, huh?</i>

16
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:44,465
Mrs. Mulwray's waiting for you
with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.

17
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:48,259
<i>Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr. Gittes?</i>

18
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,221
<i>- Mrs. Mulwray, how do you do?
- Mr. Gittes.</i>

19
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:55,765
<i>Now, what seems to be the problem?</i>

20
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,059
<i>My husband,</i>

21
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:00,812
<i>I believe, is seeing another woman.</i>

22
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:05,774
- No. Really?
- I'm afraid so.

23
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:07,526
I am sorry.

24
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:11,614
<i>Mr. Gittes, please, do you think
we could discuss this alone?</i>

25
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:16,826
<i>I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray.
These are my operatives,</i>

26
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:20,205
<i>and at some point,
they're going to have to assist me.</i>

27
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,707
I can't do everything myself.

28
00:04:22,832 --> 00:04:24,166
Of course not.

29
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,584
<i>Now,</i>

30
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:32,424
what makes you certain
that your husband is

31
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,134
involved with someone?

32
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:36,928
A wife can tell.

33
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:41,599
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,
do you love your husband?</i>

34
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:43,934
<i>Yes, of course!</i>

35
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:46,436
<i>- Then go home and forget everything.
- But, I...</i>

36
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:48,688
<i>I'm sure that he loves you, too,
Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

37
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:52,691
<i>Do you know the expression,
"Let sleeping dogs lie"?</i>

38
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:56,278
You're better off not knowing.

39
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,988
I have to know.

40
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,285
Very well.

41
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:08,123
What is your husband's first name?

42
00:05:08,248 --> 00:05:09,374
Hollis.

43
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:11,083
Hollis Mulwray.

44
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:15,254
- Water and Power?
- He's Chief Engineer.

45
00:05:16,713 --> 00:05:18,507
Chief Engineer?

46
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:27,723
<i>Mrs. Mulwray, this...</i>

47
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:32,269
This type of investigation can be hard
on your pocketbook.

48
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:34,521
It takes time...

49
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:37,441
<i>Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.</i>

50
00:05:41,026 --> 00:05:42,820
<i>Okay, we'II...</i>

51
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:45,865
We'll see what we can do.

52
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:48,533
<i>Gentlemen, today
you can walk out that door,</i>

53
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,703
<i>turn right, hop a streetcar,
and within 25 minutes,</i>

54
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,330
end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.

55
00:05:54,497 --> 00:05:58,167
<i>Now, you can swim in it and you can
fish in it, but you can't drink it,</i>

56
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,503
and you can't irrigate
an orange grove with it.

57
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,173
<i>Now remember,
we live next door to the ocean,</i>

58
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:07,383
but we also live on the edge of a desert.

59
00:06:07,508 --> 00:06:10,136
Los Angeles is a desert community.

60
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:13,806
<i>Beneath this building,
beneath our streets, is a desert.</i>

61
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:16,892
<i>And without water,
the dust will rise up and cover us</i>

62
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:18,393
as though we never existed.

63
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,688
<i>Now, the Alto Vallejo
can save us from this,</i>

64
00:06:21,855 --> 00:06:25,691
and I respectfully suggest
that $8.5 million

65
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:29,737
is a fair price to pay
to keep the desert from our streets

66
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:30,863
and not on top of them.

67
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:32,156
<i>Hear, hear!</i>

68
00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:40,705
<i>Mayor Bagby, let's hear
from all the departments again.</i>

69
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:44,042
<i>I suppose we'd better take
Water and Power first.</i>

70
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:45,375
<i>Mr. Mulwray?</i>

71
00:06:56,928 --> 00:06:58,888
<i>In case you've forgotten, gentlemen,</i>

72
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:02,600
over 500 lives were lost
when the Van der Lip Dam gave way.

73
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,729
Core samples have shown
that beneath this bedrock

74
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:12,400
is shale similar to the permeable shale
in the Van der Lip disaster.

75
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:15,528
It couldn't withstand
that kind of pressure.

76
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:19,240
And now you propose
yet another dirt-banked terminus dam

77
00:07:19,323 --> 00:07:22,534
<i>with slopes of 2.5:1 , 112 feet high,</i>

78
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:25,120
<i>and a 12,000-acre water surface.</i>

79
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:27,580
<i>Well, it won't hold.</i>

80
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,792
I won't build it. It's that simple.

81
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,710
I'm not going to make
the same mistake twice.

82
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:35,629
<i>Thank you, gentlemen.</i>

83
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:43,803
Quiet! Quiet!

84
00:07:46,347 --> 00:07:50,226
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Get those goddamn things out of here!

85
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:52,644
- Hold some of them.
- Tell me where to take them!

86
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:56,314
<i>You don't have an answer for that
so quick, do you?</i>

87
00:07:56,481 --> 00:08:00,067
<i>You steal water from the Valley,
ruin the grazing,</i>

88
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:02,945
starve the livestock!

89
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:05,406
<i>Who's paying you to do that,
Mr. Mulwray?</i>

90
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:07,158
That's what I want to know!

91
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,875
<i>- Jeez, he was there all night.
- That's right.</i>

92
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:01,336
I had to go back three times
to pick up the watches.

93
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:09,053
<i>Yesterday he went to three reservoirs,</i>

94
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:12,722
<i>a men's room at a Richfield gas station,
and The Pig'n Whistle.</i>

95
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:15,391
The guy's got water on the brain.

96
00:13:27,277 --> 00:13:29,361
So what do you got?

97
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:52,549
This?

98
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:56,845
<i>Well, they got into a terrific argument
outside The Pig'n Whistle.</i>

99
00:13:58,888 --> 00:13:59,931
What about?

100
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:02,475
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud.

101
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,435
<i>I heard only one thing, though.</i>

102
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,812
"Apple core."

103
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:08,897
- "Apple core"?
- Yeah.

104
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:15,112
<i>My God, Walsh, is that
what you spent your day doing?</i>

105
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,656
<i>Look, you tell me to take pictures,
I take pictures.</i>

106
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:21,367
<i>Let me explain
something to you, Walsh.</i>

107
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:22,868
J.J. Gittes and Associates.

108
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:26,371
This business requires
a certain amount of finesse.

109
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:30,625
<i>What is it, Sophie?</i>

110
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,627
<i>Duffy's on the phone.</i>

111
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:39,007
<i>- Yeah, Duff, where are you?
- I got it!</i>

112
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:41,802
<i>He's found himself
some cute little twist, the old buzzard...</i>

113
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:43,429
Okay. Slow down. Where are you?

114
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:45,221
<i>I'm at Glendale and Douglas.</i>

115
00:14:45,346 --> 00:14:48,182
<i>They're in Echo Park in a rowboat.
A rowboat!</i>

116
00:14:48,307 --> 00:14:49,600
Okay.

117
00:14:52,353 --> 00:14:53,937
Echo Park.

118
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:55,147
Water again.

119
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,746
<i>Okay, pal, let's have us a big smile.</i>

120
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,920
You'll love it.

121
00:16:11,298 --> 00:16:13,258
Here. Let me...

122
00:16:25,603 --> 00:16:28,730
<i>When you get so much publicity,
you got to get blasé about it.</i>

123
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,359
<i>Let's face it, Jake,
you're practically a movie star.</i>

124
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:40,282
<i>- Just look at that, Barn.
- Yeah, the heat's murder.</i>

125
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:41,742
Sure is.

126
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,203
Fools' names and fools' faces.

127
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:50,333
<i>- What's that, pal?
- Nothing.</i>

128
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:53,044
You got a hell of a way to make a living.

129
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:56,422
Oh? And what do you do
to make ends meet?

130
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:59,425
<i>Mortgage department,
First National Bank.</i>

131
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:03,679
<i>Tell me, did you foreclose
on many families this week?</i>

132
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:06,222
<i>We don't publish a record in the paper,
I can tell you that.</i>

133
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:07,765
Neither do I.

134
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,393
<i>No, you have your press agent do it.</i>

135
00:17:10,476 --> 00:17:13,730
<i>Who is this bimbo, Barney?
Is he a regular customer or what?</i>

136
00:17:13,855 --> 00:17:15,564
<i>Hey, listen, pal, I make an honest living.</i>

137
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:17,607
People only come to me
when they're in a desperate situation.

138
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:19,943
I help them out.
I don't kick families out of their houses

139
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:22,988
<i>- like you bums down at the bank do!
- Jake, can I tell you about the guy who...</i>

140
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:24,905
Maybe you'd like to step down
out of the barber chair

141
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:26,490
and maybe we can go outside
and discuss it.

142
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:27,616
<i>- What do you think?
- Oh, come on.</i>

143
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:29,076
<i>Jake, let me tell you about the guy
who got tired...</i>

144
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:31,203
I don't know how that thing
got in the newspaper.

145
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:33,456
<i>It was so quick,
I didn't even know it myself.</i>

146
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:35,665
- Thank you.
- I make an honest living!

147
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,250
Of course you do.

148
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,627
<i>Anyway, this guy
who got tired of screwing his wife</i>

149
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:42,130
<i>- said to his friend, "What do I do?"
- An honest living, you understand?</i>

150
00:17:42,297 --> 00:17:44,131
<i>So the guy says, "Why don't you do
what the Chinese do?"</i>

151
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:45,841
<i>He says, "What do the Chinese do?"</i>

152
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:48,093
<i>He says, "The Chinese they screw
a little and they get tired..."</i>

153
00:17:49,678 --> 00:17:51,597
<i>Duffy. Hey, Walsh!</i>

154
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,308
<i>Sophie, go to the little girls' room
for a minute, okay?</i>

155
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,144
<i>- But, Mr. Gittes...
- Sophie...</i>

156
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,813
<i>Yes, Mr. Gittes.</i>

157
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:01,939
<i>- Jake...
- Duffy, listen to me, man.</i>

158
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:03,315
I want to tell you a story.

159
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,525
<i>So, there's this guy, Walsh,
you understand?</i>

160
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,444
He's tired of screwing his wife.

161
00:18:07,527 --> 00:18:09,112
<i>- Jake, there's a problem...
- Wait a second, Duffy.</i>

162
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:10,781
You're always in such a hurry.

163
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:12,490
<i>So his friend says to him,</i>

164
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,784
<i>"Hey, why don't you
do it like the Chinese do?"</i>

165
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,827
<i>So he says,
"Well, how do the Chinese do it?"</i>

166
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:19,538
<i>The guy says, "Well, the Chinese,
first they screw a little bit,</i>

167
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:22,290
"then they stop and they go
and read a little Confucius.

168
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:25,293
<i>"Come back, screw a little bit more,
then they stop again,</i>

169
00:18:25,377 --> 00:18:27,212
- "go back and they screw a little..."
- Jake.

170
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:29,672
<i>Walsh, just listen to me for a second.</i>

171
00:18:29,756 --> 00:18:31,173
<i>I mean, you'll love this.</i>

172
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,468
<i>Now, then they go back
and they screw a little bit more,</i>

173
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:36,512
and then they go out
and they contemplate the moon

174
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:39,515
or something like that.
Makes it more exciting.

175
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:43,518
<i>So, now, the guy goes home and
he starts screwing his own wife, see.</i>

176
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:45,895
<i>So, he screws her for a little bit,
and then he stops.</i>

177
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,731
<i>He goes out of the room
and reads LIFE magazine.</i>

178
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:50,899
<i>Then he goes back in,
he starts screwing again,</i>

179
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:52,526
<i>and he says,
"Excuse me for a minute, honey"</i>

180
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:54,319
and he goes out
and he smokes a cigarette.

181
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:56,738
<i>Now, his wife is getting sore as hell.</i>

182
00:18:56,863 --> 00:18:58,823
<i>He comes back in the room,
he starts screwing again,</i>

183
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:00,866
<i>he gets up to start to leave again
to go look at the moon,</i>

184
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:02,827
<i>she looks at him and says,
"Hey, what's the matter with you?</i>

185
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,705
"You're screwing just like a Chinaman!"

186
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:08,665
Jesus!

187
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,500
That Barney!

188
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,215
Mr. Gittes?

189
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,217
Yes.

190
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:22,553
Do you know me?

191
00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:24,847
<i>Well,</i>

192
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,725
I think I would have remembered.

193
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:30,768
Have we ever met?

194
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:34,689
<i>Well, no.</i>

195
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:36,064
Never?

196
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:37,399
Never.

197
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:39,234
That's what I thought.

198
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:41,403
<i>You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.</i>

199
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,864
<i>You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife?</i>

200
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:48,576
Not that Mulwray?

201
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:51,245
<i>Yes, Mr. Gittes, that Mulwray.</i>

202
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,623
<i>And since you agree with me
that we've never met before,</i>

203
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,044
<i>you must also agree with me
that I never hired you to do anything,</i>

204
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:01,588
certainly not spy on my husband.

205
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:04,423
<i>I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes.</i>

206
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:07,885
<i>Well, you're going to get it.</i>

207
00:20:08,677 --> 00:20:10,095
<i>Now, wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

208
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:12,264
I think there's been some
misunderstanding here.

209
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:13,931
There's no point
in getting tough with me. I'm just...

210
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:17,101
<i>I don't get tough with anyone, Mr. Gittes.</i>

211
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:18,811
My lawyer does.

212
00:20:20,355 --> 00:20:23,106
<i>Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes.</i>

213
00:20:26,485 --> 00:20:29,613
I suppose we'll be hearing
from your attorney.

214
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:47,420
<i>- Mr. Mulwray?
- He's not in, Mr...</i>

215
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:50,173
- Gittes.
- May I ask what this is regarding?

216
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,633
It's a personal matter.
Has he been gone long?

217
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:54,176
Since lunch.

218
00:20:54,677 --> 00:20:57,846
<i>- Gee whiz, and I'm late.
- He was expecting you?</i>

219
00:20:58,013 --> 00:21:01,474
Fifteen minutes ago.
Why don't I just go in and wait?

220
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:03,976
Sir?

221
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:09,732
Is Mr. Yelburton there?

222
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:12,859
Is he still in the building?

223
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,487
Very well. Thank you.

224
00:22:37,518 --> 00:22:41,230
<i>Can I help you? Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.</i>

225
00:22:41,356 --> 00:22:42,815
J.J. Gittes.

226
00:22:42,982 --> 00:22:45,567
<i>It's not a departmental matter,
Mr. Yelburton.</i>

227
00:22:45,692 --> 00:22:47,903
I wonder if you'd care
to wait in my office.

228
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:49,112
Certainly.

229
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,282
We're a bit nervous around here

230
00:22:52,366 --> 00:22:55,284
with all this business in the papers
about Mr. Mulwray.

231
00:22:55,368 --> 00:22:57,078
Right this way.

232
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:07,337
<i>You know, after you've worked
with a man for a certain length of time,</i>

233
00:23:07,462 --> 00:23:10,006
<i>you come to know his habits, his values.</i>

234
00:23:10,131 --> 00:23:11,174
You come to know him.

235
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:14,468
And either he's the kind
who chases after women or he isn't.

236
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:15,928
And Mulwray isn't?

237
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:18,305
He never even kids about it.

238
00:23:18,722 --> 00:23:21,475
<i>Well, maybe he takes it very seriously.</i>

239
00:23:24,018 --> 00:23:26,604
<i>- Sit down.
- No, thank you.</i>

240
00:23:26,729 --> 00:23:28,856
Do you know
where Mulwray's having lunch?

241
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:31,025
<i>No, I'm sorry, I don't.</i>

242
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:33,986
<i>Well, tell him I'll be back.</i>

243
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,321
I will.

244
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:38,657
Do you mind if I take one of your cards?

245
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,617
In case I have
to get in touch with you again.

246
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:43,077
<i>- No, help yourself.
- Thank you.</i>

247
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:49,917
Mulvihill! What are you doing here?

248
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:52,335
They shut my water off.
What's it to you?

249
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:55,714
How'd you find out about it?
You don't drink it.

250
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,341
You don't take a bath in it.

251
00:23:58,425 --> 00:24:00,134
They wrote you a letter!

252
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:03,178
But then you'd have to be able to read.

253
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:08,600
<i>Relax, Mulvihill. Glad to see you.
You know Claude Mulvihill here?</i>

254
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:11,311
<i>Well, I hope so. He's working for us.</i>

255
00:24:11,436 --> 00:24:12,520
Doing what?

256
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:14,105
<i>Well, frankly, there have been
some threats</i>

257
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,982
to blow up the city reservoirs.

258
00:24:16,107 --> 00:24:18,650
<i>- Any particular reason?
- Well, it's this darn drought.</i>

259
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:21,403
We've had to ration water in the Valley
and the farmers are desperate.

260
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:23,989
But what can we do? The rest of the city
needs drinking water.

261
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:26,742
<i>- Well, you're in luck, Mr. Yelburton.
- How's that?</i>

262
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:29,410
<i>When Mulvihill here
was Sheriff of Ventura County,</i>

263
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:32,872
the rum runners landed hundreds
of tonnes of booze on the beach

264
00:24:32,997 --> 00:24:35,458
and never lost a drop.

265
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:38,877
He ought to be able
to hold on to your water for you.

266
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:41,475
J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.

267
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:06,664
Please.

268
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:23,887
You wait.

269
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,612
- Bad for glass.
- Yeah. Sure.

270
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:31,907
Bad for the glass.

271
00:28:08,606 --> 00:28:09,607
Mr. Gittes.

272
00:28:09,774 --> 00:28:13,236
<i>Actually, I came to see
your husband, Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

273
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,614
Would you like something to drink?

274
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:18,907
What are you having?

275
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:21,785
<i>- Iced tea.
- That'll be fine, thank you.</i>

276
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:25,079
<i>- Two iced teas, Kahn, please?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

277
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:28,416
My husband's at the office.

278
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,295
<i>Actually, he's not, Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

279
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,921
and he's checked out of his apartment
at the El Macondo.

280
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,841
That's not his apartment.

281
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,760
<i>Anyway, I...</i>

282
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,514
<i>The point is, is I'm not in business
to be loved, but I am in business,</i>

283
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:48,017
<i>and believe me, Mrs. Mulwray,
whoever set your husband up,</i>

284
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:49,268
set me up.

285
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:51,602
L.A.'s a small town. People talk.

286
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:55,148
I'm just trying to make a living.
I don't want to become a local joke.

287
00:28:55,315 --> 00:28:58,776
<i>Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it.
I'll drop the lawsuit.</i>

288
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,986
<i>- What?
- I said, I'll drop the lawsuit.</i>

289
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:03,196
So let's just drop the whole thing.

290
00:29:03,322 --> 00:29:05,032
<i>- Sugar, lemon, or both?
- Both.</i>

291
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:06,992
<i>- Mrs. Mulwray...
- Yes, Mr. Gittes?</i>

292
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:09,202
...I don't want to drop it.

293
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:13,539
I better talk to your husband about this.

294
00:29:13,706 --> 00:29:16,167
Why? What on Earth for?

295
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,336
Hollis seems to think
you're an innocent man.

296
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:22,172
<i>Well, I've been accused
of a lot of things before, Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

297
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:23,381
but never that.

298
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:25,467
<i>Look, somebody's gone
to a lot of trouble here,</i>

299
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,844
<i>and lawsuit or no lawsuit,
I intend to find out.</i>

300
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:31,221
I'm not supposed to be the one
who's caught with his pants down.

301
00:29:31,388 --> 00:29:33,807
<i>So unless it's a problem,
I'd like to talk to your husband.</i>

302
00:29:33,891 --> 00:29:35,851
Why should it be a problem?

303
00:29:35,934 --> 00:29:40,188
<i>- May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
- You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.</i>

304
00:29:41,397 --> 00:29:43,524
<i>Well, that little girlfriend,
she was pretty,</i>

305
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,902
<i>in a cheap sort of a way, of course.</i>

306
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:49,363
She's disappeared.
Maybe they disappeared together.

307
00:29:49,446 --> 00:29:52,407
Suppose they did.
How does that affect you?

308
00:29:52,908 --> 00:29:55,619
<i>- It's nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray.
- It's very personal!</i>

309
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:58,037
It couldn't be more personal.

310
00:29:58,955 --> 00:30:01,749
Is this business
or an obsession with you?

311
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:03,793
Let's look at it this way.

312
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:07,545
<i>Now, this phony broad,
excuse the language,</i>

313
00:30:07,629 --> 00:30:10,090
she tells me she's you. She hires me.

314
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:12,384
<i>Now, whoever put her up to it
doesn't have anything against me.</i>

315
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:13,635
They're out to get your husband.

316
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,261
<i>If I can see him, I can help him.</i>

317
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:21,892
Did you talk to him this morning?

318
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:23,644
No.

319
00:30:24,353 --> 00:30:26,104
I went riding rather early.

320
00:30:26,938 --> 00:30:28,773
Looks like you went quite a distance.

321
00:30:28,856 --> 00:30:30,775
I was riding bareback.

322
00:30:32,443 --> 00:30:33,569
You...

323
00:30:34,445 --> 00:30:36,947
You might try the Oak Pass
or the Stone Canyon Reservoir.

324
00:30:37,114 --> 00:30:38,907
<i>Frequently, at lunch,
Hollis takes walks around them.</i>

325
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:40,492
<i>Otherwise, he'll be home by 6:30.</i>

326
00:30:40,617 --> 00:30:42,286
I'll stop by.

327
00:30:42,452 --> 00:30:44,161
Please call first.

328
00:31:00,677 --> 00:31:02,804
<i>Sorry, closed to public, sir.</i>

329
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,806
<i>Oh, that's all right, Officer.</i>

330
00:31:07,224 --> 00:31:10,311
<i>Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.</i>

331
00:31:10,853 --> 00:31:13,980
<i>- Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.
- That's okay.</i>

332
00:31:39,837 --> 00:31:42,005
- Gittes! For Christ's sake!
- Loach.

333
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:44,341
- Get out of here before he sees you.
- What are you talking about?

334
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:46,718
- What's going on here?
- Loach!

335
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:49,846
<i>Hello, Jake.</i>

336
00:31:50,721 --> 00:31:52,514
Lou. How are you?

337
00:31:53,724 --> 00:31:58,354
<i>Lousy cold I can't seem to shake,
but otherwise, I'm okay.</i>

338
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,649
<i>- Yeah, summer colds are the worst.
- Yeah, they are.</i>

339
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:04,192
<i>There's no smoking here, sir...</i>

340
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:07,153
<i>That's all right, Officer.
We can make an exception this time.</i>

341
00:32:07,236 --> 00:32:10,530
I'll see he's careful with the matches
and doesn't burn himself.

342
00:32:10,614 --> 00:32:12,240
<i>Thanks, Lou.</i>

343
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:14,701
How'd you get past the guard?

344
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:18,245
<i>Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.</i>

345
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:22,375
You look like
you've done well by yourself.

346
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:23,501
I get by.

347
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:27,004
<i>Well, sometimes it takes a while
for a man to find himself.</i>

348
00:32:27,088 --> 00:32:28,255
Maybe you have.

349
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:31,424
<i>Yeah, going through
other people's dirty linen.</i>

350
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:35,428
<i>Yeah. Tell me,
you still putting Chinamen in jail</i>

351
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,763
for spitting in the laundry?

352
00:32:38,555 --> 00:32:40,766
<i>You're a little behind the times, Jake.</i>

353
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:42,935
They use steam irons now.

354
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,229
And I'm out of Chinatown.

355
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:47,355
Since when?

356
00:32:47,814 --> 00:32:49,899
Since I made lieutenant.

357
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,235
Congratulations.

358
00:32:53,611 --> 00:32:57,197
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm looking for somebody.

359
00:32:57,322 --> 00:32:58,448
Who?

360
00:32:58,991 --> 00:33:01,285
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?

361
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,078
Yeah.

362
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:05,705
I'd like to talk to him.

363
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,583
<i>So you'd like to talk to him, huh?</i>

364
00:33:10,126 --> 00:33:12,044
You're welcome to try.

365
00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:14,879
There he is.

366
00:33:32,855 --> 00:33:36,608
Looks like he was washed down
the entire length of the run-off channel.

367
00:33:37,525 --> 00:33:39,986
- Could he swim?
- Of course.

368
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:44,823
<i>Obviously, the fall
must have knocked him unconscious.</i>

369
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,160
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

370
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:52,496
this alleged affair
your husband was having.

371
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:56,000
The publicity didn't make him

372
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,961
<i>morose, or unhappy?</i>

373
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:02,464
It didn't make him happy.

374
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:05,383
There is no possibility
that he would have taken his own life?

375
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:06,635
No.

376
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,305
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

377
00:34:11,347 --> 00:34:14,433
do you happen to know the name
of the young lady in question?

378
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:16,852
No.

379
00:34:17,269 --> 00:34:19,313
- Or where she might be?
- Certainly not.

380
00:34:19,438 --> 00:34:22,273
You and your husband
never discussed her?

381
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:25,193
He...

382
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:27,403
We did.

383
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:30,322
He wouldn't tell me her name.

384
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:35,077
<i>We quarrelled over her, of course.
It came as a complete surprise to me.</i>

385
00:34:35,202 --> 00:34:37,162
A complete surprise?

386
00:34:37,287 --> 00:34:39,789
I thought you hired
a private investigator.

387
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:43,042
A private investigator?

388
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,419
Mr. Gittes.

389
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:54,719
<i>Yes, but I did that
because I thought I would put an end</i>

390
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:57,639
to a ridiculous rumor that had no basis.

391
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,351
When did Mr. Gittes inform you

392
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:05,020
that these rumors
had some foundation in fact?

393
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:08,314
<i>Just before the story
broke in the papers, Lou.</i>

394
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,776
You wouldn't happen to know
where I could find her?

395
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,986
No.

396
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,780
- Or her name?
- No.

397
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:17,864
Of course not.

398
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,158
<i>Will you need me
for anything else, Lieutenant?</i>

399
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,452
<i>Oh, no, no, Mrs. Mulwray,
I don't think so.</i>

400
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:25,998
<i>If we need any more information,
we'll be in touch.</i>

401
00:35:26,664 --> 00:35:29,417
Of course you have
my deepest sympathy.

402
00:35:30,751 --> 00:35:33,629
<i>I'll see her to the car, Lou.
I'll be right back.</i>

403
00:35:36,423 --> 00:35:39,718
<i>- Jake, come on, what's the story?
- Take it easy, guys. Let us get through.</i>

404
00:35:39,843 --> 00:35:41,177
We better do this in a hurry.

405
00:35:41,303 --> 00:35:44,598
<i>Let us through, guys!
Give us a little room!</i>

406
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:48,475
<i>You want a picture, guys? Here it is!</i>

407
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:50,561
<i>"Gittes", two T's and an E.</i>

408
00:35:51,895 --> 00:35:55,148
Thank you for
going along with me back there.

409
00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:58,443
I just didn't want to explain anything.

410
00:35:59,027 --> 00:36:00,778
I'll send you a check.

411
00:36:00,904 --> 00:36:01,946
A check?

412
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:04,948
To make it official that I've hired you.

413
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,673
I'll get to him this afternoon if I can.

414
00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:26,092
<i>Jake, what are you doing here?</i>

415
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,719
<i>Nothing, Morty. It's my lunch hour.</i>

416
00:36:27,844 --> 00:36:30,555
Thought I'd drop by
and see who dropped dead lately.

417
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,473
Yeah? Isn't this something?

418
00:36:33,098 --> 00:36:35,643
<i>Middle of a drought,
and the Water Commissioner drowns.</i>

419
00:36:35,768 --> 00:36:38,270
- Only in L.A.
- Yeah.

420
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:41,814
<i>- Looks pretty banged up.
- Well, it's a long fall.</i>

421
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,364
<i>So how are you doing, Morty?</i>

422
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:53,242
<i>Never better, except for this darn cough.</i>

423
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:55,577
<i>- You know me, Jake.
- Yeah.</i>

424
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:05,378
Who you got there?

425
00:37:05,503 --> 00:37:08,464
<i>Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk.</i>

426
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:11,883
Used to hang around Ferguson's Alley.

427
00:37:13,343 --> 00:37:15,178
Quite a character.

428
00:37:15,303 --> 00:37:19,224
Lately he'd been living
in one of the downtown storm drains.

429
00:37:20,724 --> 00:37:23,894
Had a bureau dresser down there
and everything.

430
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,063
<i>All right, there.</i>

431
00:37:32,694 --> 00:37:34,654
<i>Yeah. He drowned, too.</i>

432
00:37:35,863 --> 00:37:37,073
Come again?

433
00:37:37,198 --> 00:37:40,784
<i>Yeah. Got drunk, passed out
in the bottom of the riverbed.</i>

434
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:42,411
The L.A. River?

435
00:37:42,703 --> 00:37:46,164
<i>Yeah, right under Hollenbeck Bridge.
What's wrong with that?</i>

436
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,499
<i>Well, it's dry as a bone, Morty.</i>

437
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:50,918
It's not completely dry.

438
00:37:51,043 --> 00:37:53,838
<i>Well, he ain't gonna exactly
drown in a damp riverbed,</i>

439
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:55,965
no matter how soused he is.

440
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,717
We got water out of him. He drowned!

441
00:38:56,852 --> 00:38:58,103
Hello.

442
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,819
Howdy.

443
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,615
<i>You were riding out here
the other day, weren't you?</i>

444
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:13,951
Do you speak English?

445
00:39:18,664 --> 00:39:22,583
You were talking to a man
a few days ago. He wore glasses...

446
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,085
Yes.

447
00:39:25,503 --> 00:39:27,797
<i>What did you talk about,
do you mind my asking?</i>

448
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,591
- The water.
- What about the water?

449
00:39:30,675 --> 00:39:33,009
- When it comes.
- When it comes?

450
00:39:34,135 --> 00:39:35,637
What did you tell him?

451
00:39:35,804 --> 00:39:38,306
It comes in different parts of the river.

452
00:39:38,473 --> 00:39:40,683
Every night a different part.

453
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:05,896
Son of a bitch!
Goddamn Florsheim shoe.

454
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:17,156
<i>Hold it there, kitty-cat! Hold it!</i>

455
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,248
<i>Hello, Claude.
Where'd you get the midget?</i>

456
00:42:31,294 --> 00:42:34,130
<i>You're a very nosy fellow, kitty-cat, huh?</i>

457
00:42:34,213 --> 00:42:36,007
You know what happens
to nosy fellows?

458
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:40,010
No? Want to guess? No?

459
00:42:40,135 --> 00:42:42,304
Okay. They lose their noses.

460
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:49,810
Next time you lose the whole thing.

461
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:52,688
Cut it off and feed it to my goldfish.

462
00:42:54,106 --> 00:42:55,191
Understand?

463
00:42:56,108 --> 00:42:57,651
<i>- Understand?
- Don't you understand, Gittes?</i>

464
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:59,444
I understand.

465
00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:00,945
All right.

466
00:43:11,914 --> 00:43:14,041
<i>So some contractor
wants to build a dam,</i>

467
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:16,627
and he makes a few payoffs. So what?

468
00:43:16,752 --> 00:43:20,254
Think you can nail Mulvihill?
They'll claim you were trespassing.

469
00:43:20,379 --> 00:43:21,964
Don't want Mulvihill.

470
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:24,926
I want the big boys
that are making the payoffs.

471
00:43:25,051 --> 00:43:26,384
Then what do you do?

472
00:43:26,509 --> 00:43:28,136
Sue the shit out of them.

473
00:43:28,261 --> 00:43:29,721
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

474
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,310
<i>- What is it, Sophie?
- A Miss Sessions is calling.</i>

475
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:37,978
<i>- Who?
- Ida Sessions.</i>

476
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:42,066
Don't know her. Take a number.

477
00:43:42,525 --> 00:43:43,859
<i>Sue people like that,</i>

478
00:43:43,984 --> 00:43:48,279
they're liable to be having dinner
with the judge who's trying the suit.

479
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,824
<i>I'm sorry. Miss Sessions insists.</i>

480
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,868
<i>She says you know her.</i>

481
00:43:54,618 --> 00:43:55,744
Okay.

482
00:44:00,082 --> 00:44:03,418
<i>Hello, Miss Sessions.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.</i>

483
00:44:03,544 --> 00:44:05,419
<i>Oh, yes, we have.</i>

484
00:44:05,545 --> 00:44:07,880
<i>- Are you alone?
- Isn't everyone?</i>

485
00:44:08,881 --> 00:44:10,800
What can I do for you?

486
00:44:12,093 --> 00:44:14,344
<i>Well, I'm a working girl.</i>

487
00:44:14,469 --> 00:44:16,763
<i>I didn't come in to see you on my own.</i>

488
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:18,640
When did you come in?

489
00:44:18,765 --> 00:44:22,310
<i>I was the one who pretended to be
Mrs. Mulwray. Remember?</i>

490
00:44:22,435 --> 00:44:25,020
<i>- Shut the fuck up.
- Beg your pardon?</i>

491
00:44:25,479 --> 00:44:28,607
<i>- Yes, I remember.
- Beg your pardon? Is something wrong?</i>

492
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:32,902
No. I was just checking a detail
or two with my two associates.

493
00:44:33,027 --> 00:44:34,112
Go on.

494
00:44:34,279 --> 00:44:37,699
<i>I never expected anything to happen
like what happened to Mr. Mulwray.</i>

495
00:44:37,824 --> 00:44:40,326
<i>The point is, if it ever comes out,</i>

496
00:44:40,451 --> 00:44:43,412
<i>I want somebody to know
that I didn't know what would happen.</i>

497
00:44:43,537 --> 00:44:44,997
I understand.

498
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:48,709
Who was your employer?
That could be helpful to both of us.

499
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:50,335
<i>Oh, no! Oh, no.</i>

500
00:44:50,918 --> 00:44:52,044
<i>No.</i>

501
00:44:53,546 --> 00:44:55,840
What's your address?
Maybe we could talk this over.

502
00:44:55,965 --> 00:44:57,008
<i>No, Mr. Gittes.</i>

503
00:44:57,133 --> 00:45:00,178
<i>Just look in the obituary column
of today's L.A. Post-Record.</i>

504
00:45:00,303 --> 00:45:01,845
The obituary column?

505
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:05,724
<i>- You'll find one of those people.
- "Those people"? Miss...</i>

506
00:45:07,684 --> 00:45:08,894
Sure.

507
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:11,687
How do you like them apples?

508
00:45:42,632 --> 00:45:44,675
Ma'am.

509
00:45:49,095 --> 00:45:50,972
Thank you for coming.

510
00:45:58,479 --> 00:46:00,481
<i>- Yes, sir?
- Drink?</i>

511
00:46:01,232 --> 00:46:03,692
<i>Tom Collins.
With lime, not lemon, please.</i>

512
00:46:03,817 --> 00:46:05,778
Tom Collins with lime.

513
00:46:09,072 --> 00:46:11,574
I got your check in the mail.

514
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:14,911
<i>Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.</i>

515
00:46:15,994 --> 00:46:19,248
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,
I'm afraid that's not good enough.</i>

516
00:46:23,126 --> 00:46:24,795
How much would you like?

517
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,964
<i>Oh, stop it, the money's fine.
It's generous.</i>

518
00:46:28,172 --> 00:46:33,052
But I think you short-changed me
on the story.

519
00:46:33,928 --> 00:46:36,137
- I have?
- I think so.

520
00:46:36,263 --> 00:46:39,432
Something else besides the death
of your husband was bothering you.

521
00:46:39,558 --> 00:46:41,935
<i>You were upset, but not that upset.</i>

522
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:45,062
<i>Mr. Gittes, don't tell me how I feel.</i>

523
00:46:48,732 --> 00:46:49,942
Sorry.

524
00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:55,989
<i>Look, you sue me, your husband dies,
you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato,</i>

525
00:46:56,114 --> 00:46:59,450
all of it quicker
than the wind from a duck's ass.

526
00:46:59,826 --> 00:47:01,244
Excuse me.

527
00:47:02,495 --> 00:47:06,707
- Then you ask me to lie to the police...
- It wasn't much of a lie.

528
00:47:06,832 --> 00:47:09,293
<i>If your husband was killed, it was.</i>

529
00:47:09,418 --> 00:47:12,962
This could look like you paid me off
to withhold evidence.

530
00:47:13,087 --> 00:47:14,964
But he wasn't killed.

531
00:47:17,466 --> 00:47:20,511
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,
I think you're hiding something.</i>

532
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,933
<i>Well,</i>

533
00:47:28,768 --> 00:47:30,312
I suppose I am.

534
00:47:31,604 --> 00:47:34,148
<i>Actually, I knew about the affair.</i>

535
00:47:35,191 --> 00:47:38,110
- How did you find out?
- My husband.

536
00:47:38,194 --> 00:47:39,653
He told you?

537
00:47:40,278 --> 00:47:42,822
And you weren't the least bit upset?

538
00:47:43,198 --> 00:47:44,741
I was grateful.

539
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:48,953
<i>Mrs. Mulwray, you'll have to explain that.</i>

540
00:47:49,037 --> 00:47:50,162
Why?

541
00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:53,290
<i>Look, I do matrimonial work.
It's my métier.</i>

542
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:56,335
<i>When a wife tells me that she's happy
that her husband is cheating on her,</i>

543
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:58,962
it runs contrary to my experience.

544
00:47:59,587 --> 00:48:01,047
Unless what?

545
00:48:03,758 --> 00:48:05,760
She was cheating on him.

546
00:48:08,429 --> 00:48:09,804
Were you?

547
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:17,145
I dislike the word "cheat".

548
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,855
Did you have affairs?

549
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,650
- Mr. Gittes...
- Did he know about it?

550
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,987
<i>Well, I wouldn't run home and tell him
every time I went to bed with someone,</i>

551
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:29,155
if that's what you mean.

552
00:48:29,447 --> 00:48:31,866
Is there anything else you want
to know about me?

553
00:48:32,283 --> 00:48:34,994
Where were you
when your husband died?

554
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,037
I can't tell you.

555
00:48:37,204 --> 00:48:38,705
You mean you don't know
where you were?

556
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:42,167
<i>- I mean I can't tell you.
- You were seeing someone, too.</i>

557
00:48:43,961 --> 00:48:45,671
For very long?

558
00:48:45,754 --> 00:48:48,840
<i>I don't see anyone
for very long, Mr. Gittes.</i>

559
00:48:49,382 --> 00:48:51,342
It's difficult for me.

560
00:48:54,303 --> 00:48:58,223
<i>Now, I think you know
all you need know about me.</i>

561
00:48:59,808 --> 00:49:00,851
I didn't want publicity.

562
00:49:00,976 --> 00:49:04,271
<i>I didn't want to go
into any of this, then or now.</i>

563
00:49:05,229 --> 00:49:06,355
Is that all?

564
00:49:10,568 --> 00:49:14,113
<i>By the way,
what does this "C" stand for?</i>

565
00:49:16,406 --> 00:49:17,532
"Cross."

566
00:49:20,076 --> 00:49:22,412
- It's your maiden name?
- Yes.

567
00:49:22,912 --> 00:49:24,037
Why?

568
00:49:24,788 --> 00:49:26,206
No reason.

569
00:49:26,582 --> 00:49:28,584
You must've had a reason
to ask me that.

570
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,586
No. I'm just a snoop.

571
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:39,802
No. I have my own car. The Packard.

572
00:49:39,969 --> 00:49:41,804
<i>Wait a minute, sonny.</i>

573
00:49:41,971 --> 00:49:44,097
I think you better come with me.

574
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,433
But why? There's nothing more to say.

575
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:48,768
<i>Will you get my car, please?</i>

576
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,813
<i>Okay, go home.</i>

577
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,734
<i>But in case you're interested,
your husband was murdered.</i>

578
00:49:56,817 --> 00:49:59,111
Somebody's been dumping
thousands of tonnes of water

579
00:49:59,195 --> 00:50:00,321
<i>from the city's reservoirs,</i>

580
00:50:00,488 --> 00:50:02,780
and we're supposed to be
in the middle of a drought.

581
00:50:02,947 --> 00:50:05,617
<i>He found out about it, and he was killed.</i>

582
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,577
There's a waterlogged drunk
in the morgue.

583
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,163
<i>Involuntary manslaughter,
if anybody wants to take the trouble,</i>

584
00:50:10,288 --> 00:50:11,288
which they don't.

585
00:50:11,455 --> 00:50:13,624
<i>It seems like half the city
is trying to cover it all up,</i>

586
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,626
which is fine by me.

587
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,462
<i>But, Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

588
00:50:18,545 --> 00:50:20,838
<i>I goddamn near lost my nose,</i>

589
00:50:21,005 --> 00:50:22,256
and I like it.

590
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,258
I like breathing through it.

591
00:50:24,342 --> 00:50:27,512
And I still think
that you're hiding something.

592
00:50:36,228 --> 00:50:38,021
Mr. Gittes...

593
00:50:47,696 --> 00:50:50,615
J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.

594
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:23,728
Mr. Yelburton will be busy
for some time.

595
00:51:24,104 --> 00:51:27,523
<i>Well, it's my lunch hour. I can wait.</i>

596
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,734
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.

597
00:51:31,402 --> 00:51:33,487
I take a long lunch hour.

598
00:51:35,114 --> 00:51:37,532
<i>All day, sometimes.</i>

599
00:52:37,461 --> 00:52:39,963
Noah Cross worked
for the Water Department.

600
00:52:40,088 --> 00:52:41,380
Yes.

601
00:52:41,506 --> 00:52:43,758
<i>- No.
- Well, did he or didn't he?</i>

602
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:45,843
He owned it.

603
00:52:47,136 --> 00:52:49,597
He owned the Water Department?

604
00:52:49,722 --> 00:52:50,847
Yes.

605
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:56,186
<i>You mean, he owned
the entire water supply for the city?</i>

606
00:52:56,311 --> 00:52:57,437
Yes.

607
00:53:02,566 --> 00:53:05,236
How did they get it away from him?

608
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:08,781
Mr. Mulwray felt
the public should own the water.

609
00:53:08,906 --> 00:53:10,657
Mr. Mulwray?

610
00:53:10,782 --> 00:53:13,368
I thought you said Cross owned it.

611
00:53:13,493 --> 00:53:15,411
Along with Mr. Mulwray.

612
00:53:16,579 --> 00:53:20,457
<i>- They were partners?
- Yes! Yes, they were partners.</i>

613
00:53:58,241 --> 00:54:00,869
Mr. Yelburton will see you now.

614
00:54:06,457 --> 00:54:08,667
<i>Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting.</i>

615
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:11,962
<i>These staff meetings,
they just go on and on.</i>

616
00:54:12,087 --> 00:54:16,299
Yeah. Must be especially tough
to take over under these circumstances.

617
00:54:16,424 --> 00:54:20,428
Yes. Hollis was the best
department chief the city's ever had.

618
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:23,473
<i>My goodness,
what happened to your nose?</i>

619
00:54:23,598 --> 00:54:25,390
Cut myself shaving.

620
00:54:26,558 --> 00:54:29,561
<i>Well, you ought to be more careful.
That must really smart.</i>

621
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:31,521
Only when I breathe.

622
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,693
Only when you breathe.

623
00:54:38,402 --> 00:54:41,363
Don't tell me you're still working
for Mrs. Mulwray.

624
00:54:41,489 --> 00:54:43,823
- I never was.
- I don't understand.

625
00:54:44,908 --> 00:54:46,785
<i>Neither do I, actually.</i>

626
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,411
You hired me.

627
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,790
Or you hired that chippy to hire me.

628
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:55,501
<i>Mr. Gittes, you're not making
a bit of sense.</i>

629
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,796
<i>Well, let's look at it this way.</i>

630
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:01,089
Mulwray didn't want to build a dam.

631
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,424
He had a reputation
that was hard to get around.

632
00:55:03,549 --> 00:55:05,343
You decided to ruin it.

633
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,805
Then he found out
you were dumping water at night.

634
00:55:09,555 --> 00:55:11,057
Then he was...

635
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,724
Drowned.

636
00:55:13,642 --> 00:55:16,478
<i>Mr. Gittes,
that's an outrageous accusation.</i>

637
00:55:16,603 --> 00:55:18,897
I don't know what you're talking about.

638
00:55:19,022 --> 00:55:22,817
<i>Well, Whitey Mehrholtz
over at the Times will.</i>

639
00:55:22,942 --> 00:55:25,486
Dumping thousands of gallons of water
down the toilet

640
00:55:25,611 --> 00:55:28,447
<i>in the middle of a drought, that's news.</i>

641
00:55:30,324 --> 00:55:31,908
<i>Mr. Gittes,</i>

642
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:34,244
we're...

643
00:55:35,745 --> 00:55:38,832
<i>We're not anxious for this to get around,
but we have been diverting a little water</i>

644
00:55:38,957 --> 00:55:41,917
to irrigate orange groves
in the Northwest Valley.

645
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:44,711
<i>As you know, the farmers out there
have no legal right to our water,</i>

646
00:55:44,837 --> 00:55:46,421
<i>but we've been trying to help
some of them out,</i>

647
00:55:46,547 --> 00:55:48,465
keep them from going under.

648
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:52,301
<i>Naturally, when you divert water,
there's a little run-off.</i>

649
00:55:52,426 --> 00:55:54,512
Yeah. A little run-off.

650
00:55:55,346 --> 00:55:59,015
- Where'd you say those groves were?
- In the Northwest Valley.

651
00:55:59,141 --> 00:56:01,935
That's like saying they're in Arizona.

652
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:06,815
<i>Mr. Gittes, my field men are out.
I can't give you the exact location.</i>

653
00:56:07,315 --> 00:56:09,984
<i>- You're a married man, aren't you?
- Yes.</i>

654
00:56:10,151 --> 00:56:13,112
Hard-working? Wife? Kids?

655
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:15,114
Yes.

656
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:17,324
I don't want to nail you.

657
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:24,998
I want to find out who put you up to it.

658
00:56:25,165 --> 00:56:27,374
I'll give you a few days to think about it.

659
00:56:27,499 --> 00:56:29,334
Call me. I can help.

660
00:56:30,043 --> 00:56:31,128
Who knows?

661
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:34,798
<i>Maybe we can put the whole thing off
on a few big-shots,</i>

662
00:56:34,923 --> 00:56:36,508
and you can stay
the head of the department

663
00:56:36,674 --> 00:56:38,509
for the next 20 years.

664
00:57:20,214 --> 00:57:22,591
<i>- Drink?
- No, thank you.</i>

665
00:57:27,929 --> 00:57:30,056
What is your usual salary?

666
00:57:30,973 --> 00:57:34,935
<i>$35 a day, plus 20 to my associates,</i>

667
00:57:35,644 --> 00:57:37,187
<i>plus expenses,</i>

668
00:57:38,146 --> 00:57:40,565
plus a bonus if I show results.

669
00:57:43,901 --> 00:57:47,613
<i>Whoever is behind my husband's death,
why have they gone to all this trouble?</i>

670
00:57:47,738 --> 00:57:48,948
Money.

671
00:57:49,824 --> 00:57:52,367
<i>How they plan to make it
out of emptying reservoirs,</i>

672
00:57:52,492 --> 00:57:54,244
that I don't know.

673
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:56,412
<i>I'll pay your salary,</i>

674
00:57:56,496 --> 00:57:58,123
<i>plus $5,000</i>

675
00:57:58,623 --> 00:58:02,584
<i>if you find out what happened to Hollis,
and who is involved.</i>

676
00:58:06,922 --> 00:58:11,092
<i>Sophie, draw up one of our
standard contracts for Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

677
00:58:11,175 --> 00:58:12,927
<i>Yes, Mr. Gittes.</i>

678
00:58:16,764 --> 00:58:18,766
Tell me something.

679
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:21,893
Did you get married before or after
Mulwray and your father

680
00:58:21,977 --> 00:58:24,104
sold the Water Department?

681
00:58:24,521 --> 00:58:27,149
<i>Noah Cross is your father, isn't he?</i>

682
00:58:29,859 --> 00:58:31,444
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

683
00:58:32,111 --> 00:58:33,988
It was sometime after.

684
00:58:34,989 --> 00:58:38,284
I was just out of grade school
when they did that.

685
00:58:39,993 --> 00:58:43,246
Then you married
your father's business partner.

686
00:58:45,999 --> 00:58:49,001
<i>You've already got one going,
Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

687
00:58:50,711 --> 00:58:54,673
Does my talking about your father
upset you?

688
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:56,091
<i>Why, no.</i>

689
00:58:57,342 --> 00:58:58,926
Yes. A little.

690
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:01,137
<i>You see, Hollis and my...</i>

691
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,765
My father

692
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:06,476
had a falling-out finally.

693
00:59:07,851 --> 00:59:10,854
Over you
or over the Water Department?

694
00:59:10,979 --> 00:59:13,148
Not over me. Why should it be over me?

695
00:59:13,231 --> 00:59:14,858
Then it was over
the Water Department.

696
00:59:15,025 --> 00:59:15,984
Yes.

697
00:59:17,234 --> 00:59:19,695
<i>Hollis felt that the water
should belong to the public,</i>

698
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:23,532
and I don't think my father felt that way.

699
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,826
<i>Actually, it was over
the Van der Lip Dam.</i>

700
00:59:26,993 --> 00:59:28,286
<i>You know, the dam that broke?</i>

701
00:59:28,369 --> 00:59:31,706
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Yes. Hollis never forgave him for it.</i>

702
00:59:31,873 --> 00:59:36,043
- Never forgave him for what?
- For talking him into building it.

703
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:38,796
They never spoke from that time on.

704
00:59:42,841 --> 00:59:44,676
You sure about that?

705
00:59:45,593 --> 00:59:47,386
Of course I'm sure.

706
00:59:52,225 --> 00:59:53,559
Sign here.

707
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,853
The copy's for you.

708
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:01,369
- Mr. Gitts?
- Gittes.

709
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:03,955
How do you do?

710
01:01:04,497 --> 01:01:08,293
<i>You've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gitts.
I like that.</i>

711
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:10,252
Thanks.

712
01:01:10,335 --> 01:01:12,254
<i>If you were a bank president,
that would be one thing,</i>

713
01:01:12,337 --> 01:01:14,465
<i>but in your business, it's admirable.</i>

714
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:16,508
And it's good advertising.

715
01:01:16,633 --> 01:01:17,634
It doesn't hurt.

716
01:01:17,801 --> 01:01:21,095
It's why you attracted
a client like my daughter.

717
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:22,972
Probably.

718
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:24,974
<i>But I'm surprised
you're still working for her,</i>

719
01:01:25,099 --> 01:01:27,560
unless she's suddenly come up
with another husband.

720
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:31,730
No. She happens to think
the last one was murdered.

721
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:35,776
How'd she get that idea?

722
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,444
I think I gave it to her.

723
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:43,491
I hope you don't mind. I believe
they should be served with the head.

724
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:46,869
Fine. Long as you don't serve
chicken that way.

725
01:01:48,953 --> 01:01:52,165
<i>Tell me, what do the police say?</i>

726
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:54,626
They're calling it an accident.

727
01:01:55,752 --> 01:01:59,755
- Who's the investigating officer?
- Lou Escobar. He's a lieutenant.

728
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,424
<i>- Do you know him?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

729
01:02:02,966 --> 01:02:04,384
Where from?

730
01:02:05,177 --> 01:02:07,929
We used to work together.
In Chinatown.

731
01:02:09,931 --> 01:02:12,350
Would you call him a capable man?

732
01:02:13,184 --> 01:02:14,352
Very.

733
01:02:14,852 --> 01:02:16,103
Honest?

734
01:02:16,478 --> 01:02:17,896
As far as it goes.

735
01:02:18,772 --> 01:02:21,858
<i>Of course, he has to swim
in the same water we all do.</i>

736
01:02:21,983 --> 01:02:25,569
<i>Of course, but you've no reason to think
he's bungled the case?</i>

737
01:02:25,694 --> 01:02:27,988
- None.
- That's too bad.

738
01:02:28,948 --> 01:02:30,282
Too bad?

739
01:02:31,075 --> 01:02:34,661
It disturbs me. Makes me think
you're taking my daughter for a ride.

740
01:02:34,786 --> 01:02:37,205
<i>Financially speaking, of course.</i>

741
01:02:38,164 --> 01:02:40,250
What are you charging her?

742
01:02:42,043 --> 01:02:46,046
<i>My usual fee,
plus a bonus if I get results.</i>

743
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:48,257
Are you sleeping with her?

744
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:51,844
<i>Come, come, Mr. Gitts.</i>

745
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:55,638
<i>You don't have to think about that
to remember, do you?</i>

746
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,517
<i>If you want an answer
to that question, Mr. Cross,</i>

747
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:02,228
I'll put one of my men on the job.

748
01:03:03,812 --> 01:03:05,605
- Good afternoon.
- Mr. Gitts...

749
01:03:05,731 --> 01:03:07,399
- Gittes.
- Gittes.

750
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:11,403
You're dealing with a disturbed woman
who just lost her husband.

751
01:03:11,528 --> 01:03:13,946
I don't want her taken advantage of.

752
01:03:14,071 --> 01:03:15,906
- Sit down.
- What for?

753
01:03:18,659 --> 01:03:21,995
<i>You may think you know
what you're dealing with,</i>

754
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,247
<i>but believe me, you don't.</i>

755
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:26,958
Why is that funny?

756
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:30,211
It's what the District Attorney
used to tell me in Chinatown.

757
01:03:30,336 --> 01:03:32,129
Yeah? Was he right?

758
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:36,467
Exactly what do you know about me?
Sit down.

759
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,931
<i>Mainly that you're rich,</i>

760
01:03:44,057 --> 01:03:47,643
and too respectable
to want your name in the newspapers.

761
01:03:47,769 --> 01:03:50,395
Of course I'm respectable. I'm old.

762
01:03:52,105 --> 01:03:53,857
<i>Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores</i>

763
01:03:53,982 --> 01:03:57,069
all get respectable
if they last long enough.

764
01:03:57,652 --> 01:04:00,905
<i>I'll double whatever your fee is
and pay you $10,000</i>

765
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:03,407
if you find Hollis' girlfriend.

766
01:04:03,949 --> 01:04:06,660
<i>- Girlfriend?
- Disappeared, hasn't she?</i>

767
01:04:06,786 --> 01:04:07,953
Yeah.

768
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:11,206
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?

769
01:04:11,331 --> 01:04:12,582
Maybe.

770
01:04:14,334 --> 01:04:15,335
<i>If Mulwray was murdered,</i>

771
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:18,670
she'd be one of the last
to have seen him alive.

772
01:04:18,962 --> 01:04:21,673
When's the last time you saw Mulwray?

773
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:25,427
Sheriff's gold posse.
Bunch of damn fools

774
01:04:25,511 --> 01:04:29,472
<i>who pay $5,000 apiece
towards the Sheriff's re-election.</i>

775
01:04:30,056 --> 01:04:32,475
I let them practice up out here.

776
01:04:33,643 --> 01:04:34,811
Yeah.

777
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,439
Do you remember the last time
you saw Mulwray?

778
01:04:39,564 --> 01:04:42,067
<i>At my age, you tend to forget.</i>

779
01:04:43,527 --> 01:04:46,195
<i>It was five days ago outside
The Pig'n Whistle,</i>

780
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,031
and you had one hell of an argument.

781
01:04:49,156 --> 01:04:53,119
<i>I got the pictures in my office,
if that'll help you remember.</i>

782
01:04:56,204 --> 01:04:59,207
- What was the argument about?
- My daughter.

783
01:05:01,084 --> 01:05:02,669
What about her?

784
01:05:03,253 --> 01:05:07,047
<i>Just find the girl, Mr. Gitts.</i>

785
01:05:10,175 --> 01:05:14,137
I happen to know Hollis was fond of her.

786
01:05:15,096 --> 01:05:17,140
I'd like to help her if I can.

787
01:05:17,265 --> 01:05:21,144
I had no idea you and Hollis
were that fond of one another.

788
01:05:22,061 --> 01:05:24,354
<i>Hollis Mulwray made this city,</i>

789
01:05:25,063 --> 01:05:27,149
and he made me a fortune.

790
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,028
We were a lot closer
than Evelyn realized.

791
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:39,493
<i>If you want to hire me, I still have to
know what the argument was about.</i>

792
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:42,996
My daughter's a very jealous woman.

793
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:46,166
I didn't want her to find out
about the girl.

794
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:48,209
How did you find out?

795
01:05:48,376 --> 01:05:52,588
<i>I still got a few teeth left in my head,
and a few friends in town.</i>

796
01:05:55,591 --> 01:05:56,675
Okay.

797
01:05:58,469 --> 01:05:59,720
I'II...

798
01:06:01,137 --> 01:06:04,057
I'll have my secretary
draw up the papers.

799
01:06:04,766 --> 01:06:06,059
<i>Tell me,</i>

800
01:06:07,226 --> 01:06:11,229
are you frightened for the girl
or what Evelyn might do to her?

801
01:06:11,396 --> 01:06:13,190
Just find the girl.

802
01:06:14,733 --> 01:06:16,401
<i>I'll look into it,</i>

803
01:06:16,568 --> 01:06:19,696
as soon as I've checked out
some orange groves.

804
01:06:20,654 --> 01:06:22,198
Orange groves?

805
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,534
<i>We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.</i>

806
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:32,749
I'm a little lost.
I wonder if you could you tell me

807
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:35,585
where the plat books
for the Northwest Valley are?

808
01:06:35,752 --> 01:06:37,545
Part of it's in Ventura County.

809
01:06:37,629 --> 01:06:41,090
We don't have Ventura County
in our Hall of Records.

810
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:44,760
<i>Well, then, I'll settle
for Los Angeles County.</i>

811
01:06:45,636 --> 01:06:47,304
<i>Row 23, section C.</i>

812
01:06:51,808 --> 01:06:53,059
Weasel.

813
01:07:48,525 --> 01:07:49,943
<i>Say, sonny,</i>

814
01:07:52,195 --> 01:07:55,823
why do they have all those names
pasted in the plat books?

815
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:59,368
Land sales out of escrow
are always recorded within the week.

816
01:07:59,535 --> 01:08:02,663
- Then these are all new owners?
- That's right.

817
01:08:03,872 --> 01:08:07,333
<i>Well, that means that most of the Valley
sold in the last few months.</i>

818
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,419
If that's what it says.

819
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,714
Can I check one of these volumes out?

820
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:18,677
<i>Sir, this is not a lending library.
It's the Hall of Records.</i>

821
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:21,764
- How about a ruler?
- A ruler?

822
01:08:22,764 --> 01:08:26,017
Yeah. The print's real fine.
I left my glasses home.

823
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,728
I'd like to be able to read across.

824
01:08:40,614 --> 01:08:42,239
<i>Why, thank you.</i>

825
01:09:49,425 --> 01:09:51,176
Hold it right there!

826
01:10:59,738 --> 01:11:02,032
<i>All right, quit it. Quit, now!</i>

827
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:04,659
Search the man. See if he's armed.

828
01:11:17,754 --> 01:11:20,924
<i>I said see if he's armed,
not empty his pockets!</i>

829
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:23,300
Search him. Search him!

830
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:26,261
He ain't armed.

831
01:11:26,387 --> 01:11:27,846
<i>All right, mister, who you with,</i>

832
01:11:27,971 --> 01:11:31,099
the Water Department
or the Real Estate Office?

833
01:11:31,933 --> 01:11:33,434
- Get away from me!
- Answer him!

834
01:11:33,559 --> 01:11:34,936
<i>You come near me
with that thing again,</i>

835
01:11:35,061 --> 01:11:36,104
you're gonna need a pair of them!

836
01:11:36,229 --> 01:11:38,022
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

837
01:11:38,147 --> 01:11:42,025
I said cut that out! Give the man
a chance to say something!

838
01:11:45,737 --> 01:11:49,407
The name's Gittes.
I'm a private investigator.

839
01:11:49,532 --> 01:11:51,200
I'm not with either one of them.

840
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:54,787
<i>Then what you doing out here, mister?</i>

841
01:11:55,121 --> 01:11:57,123
A client hired me to see...

842
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,959
To see if the Water Department
was irrigating your land.

843
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:02,752
Irrigating my land?

844
01:12:02,877 --> 01:12:04,462
The Water Department's been sending
you people out here

845
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:07,298
<i>to blow up my water tanks,
they put poison down three of my wells.</i>

846
01:12:07,424 --> 01:12:09,508
I call that a funny way to irrigate.

847
01:12:09,633 --> 01:12:12,344
Who'd hire you for a thing like that?

848
01:12:17,474 --> 01:12:18,891
Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

849
01:12:18,975 --> 01:12:21,936
Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch
who's done it to us.

850
01:12:22,061 --> 01:12:26,607
<i>Mulwray's dead. You don't know what
you're talking about, you dumb Okie.</i>

851
01:12:34,031 --> 01:12:35,449
<i>Well, that's that.</i>

852
01:13:03,223 --> 01:13:04,849
What's going on?

853
01:13:05,308 --> 01:13:06,934
<i>You didn't look too good,</i>

854
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:10,021
so we thought we better call
your employer.

855
01:13:14,566 --> 01:13:16,318
Thanks for coming.

856
01:13:20,447 --> 01:13:23,574
- That dam's a con job.
- What dam?

857
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:27,411
The one your husband opposed.
They're conning L.A. into building it.

858
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:30,247
<i>But the water's not gonna go to L. A.,
it's coming right here.</i>

859
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:31,540
To the Valley?

860
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:34,125
Everything you can see.
Everything around us.

861
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:36,711
I was at the Hall of Records today.

862
01:13:42,925 --> 01:13:46,679
<i>In the last three months,
Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres,</i>

863
01:13:46,804 --> 01:13:50,474
<i>Emma Dill, 12,000,
Clarence Speer, 5,000,</i>

864
01:13:50,599 --> 01:13:53,768
<i>and Jasper Lamar Crabb, 25,000 acres.</i>

865
01:13:53,893 --> 01:13:55,853
- Jasper Lamar Crabb?
- You know him?

866
01:13:55,979 --> 01:13:59,691
- I think I would've remembered.
- Yeah.

867
01:13:59,816 --> 01:14:01,650
They're blowing these farmers
out of their land

868
01:14:01,733 --> 01:14:03,151
and then picking it up for peanuts.

869
01:14:03,276 --> 01:14:07,823
You have any idea what this land would
be worth with a steady water supply?

870
01:14:07,948 --> 01:14:10,908
About $30 million more
than they paid for it.

871
01:14:12,702 --> 01:14:16,080
- Hollis knew about this?
- That's why he was killed.

872
01:14:18,082 --> 01:14:19,874
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

873
01:14:20,709 --> 01:14:22,669
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

874
01:14:25,213 --> 01:14:26,923
- We got it!
- What?

875
01:14:27,048 --> 01:14:28,591
- We got it.
- What? What is it?

876
01:14:28,717 --> 01:14:31,719
"A memorial service was held
at the Mar Vista Inn today

877
01:14:31,885 --> 01:14:32,928
"for Jasper Lamar Crabb."

878
01:14:33,053 --> 01:14:35,431
He passed away two weeks ago.

879
01:14:36,432 --> 01:14:38,100
Why is that unusual?

880
01:14:38,559 --> 01:14:42,270
<i>He passed away two weeks ago,
and one week ago he bought the land.</i>

881
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,022
That's unusual.

882
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:31,147
<i>Hello, there. I'm Mr. Palmer.
Can I help you folks?</i>

883
01:15:31,648 --> 01:15:33,441
<i>Yes, I hope so.</i>

884
01:15:34,817 --> 01:15:36,109
It's Dad.

885
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:38,236
I can't seem to handle him anymore.

886
01:15:38,362 --> 01:15:40,656
<i>- Can I, sweetheart?
- My goodness.</i>

887
01:15:40,781 --> 01:15:43,283
Nothing with Dad. It's me.

888
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:45,951
<i>Oh, no, no, Dad is an absolute angel
with everyone else.</i>

889
01:15:46,118 --> 01:15:49,121
<i>- It's just that he and my...
- Oh, I don't know.</i>

890
01:15:49,288 --> 01:15:52,124
<i>Of course, I'm anxious
for him to have the best,</i>

891
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:53,959
and money is no object.

892
01:15:54,125 --> 01:15:56,795
Perhaps if we met with your father.

893
01:15:57,462 --> 01:16:00,131
- There is one question.
- Of course.

894
01:16:00,298 --> 01:16:03,425
Do you accept people
of the Jewish persuasion?

895
01:16:04,134 --> 01:16:06,011
<i>I'm sorry, but we don't.</i>

896
01:16:06,136 --> 01:16:07,805
Don't be sorry. Neither does Dad.

897
01:16:07,888 --> 01:16:10,808
<i>We just wanted to be sure,
didn't we, hon?</i>

898
01:16:10,975 --> 01:16:15,269
<i>Would it be possible for me to see
a list of your patients, just to be certain?</i>

899
01:16:15,353 --> 01:16:19,482
We never reveal the names
of our guests as a matter of policy.

900
01:16:19,565 --> 01:16:21,651
You would appreciate that
if your father came to live with us.

901
01:16:21,818 --> 01:16:24,987
That's exactly
what I wanted to hear you say.

902
01:16:25,153 --> 01:16:26,196
Good.

903
01:16:26,363 --> 01:16:28,657
<i>I wonder, is it too late
for us to have a look around?</i>

904
01:16:28,824 --> 01:16:30,033
No. Allow me to show you.

905
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,785
Would you mind
if we took a stroll on our own?

906
01:16:32,868 --> 01:16:35,288
Just if you'll confine yourself
to the main building.

907
01:16:35,371 --> 01:16:37,123
It's almost bedtime.

908
01:16:37,206 --> 01:16:40,459
<i>We understand. Come, my sweet.</i>

909
01:16:52,886 --> 01:16:55,472
Charlie! You ought to know
better than that!

910
01:16:55,556 --> 01:16:57,516
Sit down. Have a chair.

911
01:17:17,242 --> 01:17:20,369
They're all there. Every goddamn name.

912
01:17:26,459 --> 01:17:30,003
<i>You're looking at the owners
of a 50,000-acre empire.</i>

913
01:17:30,086 --> 01:17:31,588
They can't be.

914
01:17:36,134 --> 01:17:38,719
<i>They may not know it, but they are.</i>

915
01:17:40,429 --> 01:17:42,097
<i>- Hello, girls.
- Hello.</i>

916
01:17:42,264 --> 01:17:44,725
- Hello.
- Are any of you Emma Dill?

917
01:17:46,435 --> 01:17:49,062
- Yes? Are you Emma?
- Yes.

918
01:17:49,145 --> 01:17:51,731
<i>Well, I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time.</i>

919
01:17:51,814 --> 01:17:52,857
Why?

920
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:55,109
Did you know you were
a very wealthy woman?

921
01:17:55,276 --> 01:17:57,069
<i>Oh, I'm not.</i>

922
01:17:57,152 --> 01:18:01,239
<i>- Yes, you are. You own a lot of land.
- No more.</i>

923
01:18:02,074 --> 01:18:03,283
<i>Some time ago,</i>

924
01:18:03,408 --> 01:18:07,411
<i>my late husband owned a good deal
of beach property at Long Beach,</i>

925
01:18:07,495 --> 01:18:09,080
but we lost it.

926
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:12,083
- That's very beautiful.
- Thanks.

927
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:14,794
Where did you get
this piece of material?

928
01:18:14,919 --> 01:18:16,795
At the Abbacore Club.

929
01:18:17,128 --> 01:18:20,715
- Abbacore?
- No. The Albacore.

930
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,759
It's a fish.

931
01:18:22,842 --> 01:18:27,554
<i>My grandson is a member,
and they take very nice care of us.</i>

932
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,556
How do they do that?

933
01:18:29,682 --> 01:18:33,769
<i>Oh, give us things,
not just like this old flag, but...</i>

934
01:18:34,352 --> 01:18:35,311
But what?

935
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:38,773
<i>We're a sort of unofficial charity
of theirs, Mr. Gittes.</i>

936
01:18:39,941 --> 01:18:43,986
<i>Would you come with me, please?
Someone wants to talk with you.</i>

937
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:47,781
<i>Goodbye, ladies.</i>

938
01:18:47,864 --> 01:18:48,907
- Bye!
- Bye!

939
01:18:57,164 --> 01:19:00,167
<i>Come on.
I want you to meet someone, Gittes.</i>

940
01:19:00,293 --> 01:19:02,460
Can we leave the lady out of this?

941
01:19:02,544 --> 01:19:05,755
- Yeah. Why not?
- I'd like to see her to the car.

942
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:08,591
- She knows where it's at.
- I'll stay.

943
01:19:09,342 --> 01:19:10,927
Get in the car.

944
01:20:31,582 --> 01:20:33,292
Maid's night off?

945
01:20:34,627 --> 01:20:37,212
<i>- Why?
- What do you mean, why?</i>

946
01:20:37,337 --> 01:20:41,257
<i>- Nobody's here, that's why.
- I gave everyone the night off.</i>

947
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:44,302
Easy. It's an innocent question.

948
01:20:44,427 --> 01:20:47,471
<i>No question from you
is innocent, Mr. Gittes.</i>

949
01:20:47,596 --> 01:20:49,473
I guess you're right.

950
01:20:52,559 --> 01:20:54,436
<i>To you, Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

951
01:20:55,812 --> 01:20:58,273
<i>Frankly, tonight, you saved my...</i>

952
01:20:58,564 --> 01:21:00,358
You saved my neck.

953
01:21:03,528 --> 01:21:05,320
<i>Tell me, Mr. Gittes,</i>

954
01:21:06,697 --> 01:21:09,032
does this often happen to you?

955
01:21:10,659 --> 01:21:12,119
What's that?

956
01:21:13,036 --> 01:21:15,788
<i>Well, I'm judging only on the basis
of one afternoon and an evening,</i>

957
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,082
<i>but if this is how you go
about your work,</i>

958
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:21,961
I'd say you'd be lucky
to get through a whole day.

959
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:26,423
<i>Actually, this hasn't happened to me
for a long time.</i>

960
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,508
When was the last time?

961
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:30,218
Why?

962
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:33,095
It's an innocent question.

963
01:21:37,808 --> 01:21:41,103
- In Chinatown.
- What were you doing there?

964
01:21:43,479 --> 01:21:46,941
- Working for the District Attorney.
- Doing what?

965
01:21:47,066 --> 01:21:48,776
As little as possible.

966
01:21:48,901 --> 01:21:52,362
The District Attorney gives his men
advice like that?

967
01:21:53,238 --> 01:21:55,115
They do in Chinatown.

968
01:21:56,283 --> 01:21:58,869
Why did you leave the police force?

969
01:22:02,496 --> 01:22:07,960
<i>Do you have any peroxide,
or anything like that?</i>

970
01:22:08,085 --> 01:22:10,629
Surely. Will you come this way?

971
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:29,729
My God!

972
01:22:33,191 --> 01:22:34,901
It's a nasty cut.

973
01:22:36,903 --> 01:22:38,570
I had no idea...

974
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:44,826
Sorry!

975
01:22:46,078 --> 01:22:47,329
There.

976
01:22:48,371 --> 01:22:49,914
Is it painful?

977
01:22:53,417 --> 01:22:55,169
It must be painful.

978
01:22:57,213 --> 01:22:58,713
What's wrong?

979
01:22:59,547 --> 01:23:00,840
Your eye.

980
01:23:04,219 --> 01:23:05,929
What about it? What?

981
01:23:06,554 --> 01:23:10,099
There's something black
in the green part of your eye.

982
01:23:10,891 --> 01:23:12,017
<i>Oh, that.</i>

983
01:23:12,559 --> 01:23:16,854
It's a flaw in the iris.

984
01:23:18,147 --> 01:23:20,275
- A flaw?
- Yes.

985
01:23:21,651 --> 01:23:23,695
A sort of birthmark.

986
01:23:59,518 --> 01:24:01,478
Did you wear a uniform?

987
01:24:03,187 --> 01:24:04,606
Sometimes.

988
01:24:06,649 --> 01:24:08,943
Must have looked cute in blue.

989
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:12,988
<i>Give me a break, will you?</i>

990
01:24:13,530 --> 01:24:15,240
I don't know you.

991
01:24:16,533 --> 01:24:18,911
I want to know more about you.

992
01:24:19,453 --> 01:24:20,787
Not now.

993
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:26,500
<i>You really don't like to talk
about the past, do you?</i>
