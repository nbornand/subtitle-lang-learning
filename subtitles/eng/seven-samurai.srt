Directed by

37
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:06,263
In the early 16th Century, Japan
was in the throes of civil wars...

38
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,197
and the farmers everywhere
were being crushed...

39
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:12,236
under the iron heels
of cruel bandits.

40
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:58,816
Let's take this village too!

41
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:03,383
Wait!

42
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:06,419
We looted rice here last fall

43
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:10,093
I'm afraid they have nothing yet

44
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:14,762
Let's come back after
the barley has ripened

45
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,035
Is there no god to protect us?

46
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:54,205
Land-tax!

47
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:55,739
Forced labor!

48
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,036
War!

49
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,644
Drought!

50
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,541
Then, the bandits!

51
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:08,882
God must want us farmers to starve!

52
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:11,556
That's true, better we die

53
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:14,626
Stop complaining!

54
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:16,862
That won't help!

55
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:20,923
Let's go see the Magistrate!

56
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:22,932
Let's appeal to him!

57
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,061
What's the use?

58
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:29,469
He'd come only after
the bandits are gone!

59
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:37,574
Let's give everything to the bandits!
All the food we have!

60
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,311
And then hang ourselves!

61
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:43,954
That might get some action
out of him!

62
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:57,100
Let's make bamboo spears

63
00:05:57,303 --> 00:06:00,272
Let's kill the bandits,
kill them all!

64
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,340
They won't come back again,
if we kill them all

65
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:04,175
I don't like this idea

66
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:11,842
That's an impossibility!

67
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:16,948
You kill samurai on the run-
but not bandits!

68
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:19,284
Stop it!

69
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:20,619
No time for quarrelling!

70
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:26,291
We haven't a chance against them!

71
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:29,232
What would happen if we were
defeated? We'd all be murdered!

72
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:31,564
They kill even babies in the womb!

73
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:32,727
Enough!

74
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:38,567
Better to kill or be killed,
than feel like this

75
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,774
Farmers are born to suffer

76
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,506
That's our lot

77
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:49,755
Let's greet them meekly

78
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,181
Give up our crops

79
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:58,262
Just beg them to leave something
so we won't starve

80
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:02,959
On our knees let's beg them,
so we can live

81
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:07,434
You think they'll listen?

82
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,574
You've forgotten?

83
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:13,109
Rice we're eating, how...

84
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:36,432
Let's go see the Grandad!

85
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,900
And ask his advice!

86
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:46,697
Negotiate with them. Depend on
who you do your dealing with

87
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:50,032
They're worse than wolves.
If you give your legs!

88
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:51,866
Next they ask for your arms!

89
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:54,043
They know no limit

90
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,711
They'd come again in the fall!

91
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:57,041
But if we lose... Huh?

92
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:58,213
So we lose!

93
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:01,986
Without the crop, we'll die, anyway

94
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,484
We'll fight!

95
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:12,629
That's too reckless!

96
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,632
We're farmers.
We don't know how to fight

97
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:17,631
We'll hire samurai!

98
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:21,863
Hire samurai?
Never heard of such a thing!

99
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:26,868
I saw it with my own eyes

100
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:32,884
When your native village was burned

101
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:39,323
As I was escaping to this village,
I saw...

102
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:45,590
one village unburned.
It had hired samurai

103
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:50,093
But Grandad, there are many
different kinds of villages

104
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,602
We're eating gruel.
How do we feed samurai?

105
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:54,171
We could eat millet!

106
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:58,200
But will samurai fight for us,
just for food?

107
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:00,437
They're awfully proud!

108
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:06,777
Find hungry samurai!

109
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:14,224
Even bears come out of the forests,
when they're hungry

110
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:00,230
What insolence!

111
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:07,443
Poor as I am, I'm no beggar!

112
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,844
Fool!

113
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,149
I warned you

114
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,555
It has ripened

115
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:58,387
Of course.
Ten days have gone by

116
00:11:58,698 --> 00:11:59,858
What shall we do?

117
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:05,530
This is an early kind.
Not like ours!

118
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:12,569
I'm soaked to the bones!

119
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,612
Found any samurai, cheap,
strong and willing?

120
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:58,481
Some leftovers.
I sell 'em cheap

121
00:12:58,858 --> 00:12:59,916
That's a laugh!

122
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:02,421
What's so funny?

123
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:04,187
He's blind!

124
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:07,161
How about you?

125
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,731
No, thanks

126
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:10,965
I'd rather eat horse dung

127
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:16,671
He's broke!

128
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:19,168
I cleaned him out last night

129
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:22,280
He drew his sword
so we beat him up

130
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:24,413
He's dead broke

131
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:32,219
They only eat millet

132
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:34,959
Is that true?

133
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:39,263
Eat right or you'll become
night-blind!

134
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:43,163
You can have them
for a handful of rice

135
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:51,939
You and everybody else

136
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,298
What a waste it was!

137
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:18,135
With that rice we could
have gotten forty of those buns!

138
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:19,634
Stop it!

139
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:21,931
Am I not right?

140
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:26,707
The suckers are mad!

141
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,853
What a waste! What foolishness!

142
00:14:40,092 --> 00:14:43,994
He ate plenty

143
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:47,364
He drank plenty

144
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:50,366
Then he beat me up and left

145
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:53,369
A smart samurai!

146
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,142
How different from the one
who pretends to be sleeping!

147
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:03,037
Let's get out of here!
Let's go home!

148
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:06,307
He's crying!

149
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,277
He misses his wife!

150
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:11,152
I would pay plenty to see them love!

151
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,753
Let's go home! Please!

152
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:20,126
Go home! How can you hire samurai,
you can't even buy buns

153
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:25,095
Besides, we don't know anything
at all about samurai

154
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:28,534
As much as we know about seeds

155
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:33,435
The strong ones
are beyond our control

156
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:39,751
Any who seem to be willing
are weaklings!

157
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:53,195
I was defeated last night
only because I was hungry

158
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:55,864
Liar!

159
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:57,730
You had money to gamble away!

160
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:01,665
Want more trouble?

161
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:04,934
There's a fight!

162
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:11,310
This way, this way!

163
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:22,585
Stop it!

164
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:25,194
It's depressing!

165
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:26,626
Play on!

166
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:28,198
Play loud! We back you!

167
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:07,233
You want to go home!
And yet...

168
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:11,306
But I could never
negotiate with them!

169
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:13,770
What else can we do?

170
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:17,180
You have to deal with the bandits!

171
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,017
All right!

172
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:20,285
I see!

173
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:30,225
But -

174
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,226
What will you offer them this time?

175
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,702
Your daughter?

176
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:43,767
She's very pretty! It may work!

177
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:17,669
What's happening?

178
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:19,768
A thief is in that barn!

179
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:22,232
He was discovered
and ran in there!

180
00:19:44,663 --> 00:19:46,255
How many thieves?

181
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:48,597
Just one

182
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:50,227
One?

183
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:54,932
What's holding you back?

184
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:56,232
But we're helpless

185
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:59,002
He kidnapped a child

186
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:02,206
Says he'll kill him if we attack!

187
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:05,674
Listen! Hear that?

188
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:13,081
Poor kid!

189
00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:20,589
They've been in there since
last night. Poor kid!

190
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,464
His voice has gotten hoarse!

191
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:28,429
He's seven

192
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:31,102
His poor parents!

193
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:35,042
But what's wrong with that samurai?
Shaving his head?

194
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:36,615
A mystery

195
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:41,779
He's promised to save the boy.
He asked for two rice-balls

196
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:45,950
Then he began shaving
and asked for a priest's robe

197
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,353
I don't understand!

198
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,082
This is a priest

199
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:32,754
I'm a priest!

200
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:34,728
I'm not after you!

201
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:41,300
Don't worry

202
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,939
The boy must be starved

203
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,471
Don't come in!

204
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,850
I brought food

205
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:56,186
For you, too!

206
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,583
Take it!

207
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:04,496
What's the matter?

208
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,159
Throw it in!

209
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:54,597
No complaints
about that samurai?

210
00:24:55,574 --> 00:24:57,701
Hurry.
Before he gets to town

211
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,957
What is it?

212
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:26,728
My name is Katsushiro Okamoto

213
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:29,465
Make me your disciple!

214
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:32,801
Disciple?

215
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:36,536
My name is Kimbei Shimada.
I'm a ronin

216
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:39,944
And I have no disciples

217
00:25:40,485 --> 00:25:42,919
Rise. We can talk

218
00:25:43,856 --> 00:25:46,086
Please! Take me as your disciple!

219
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:50,785
Rise! Let's talk as we walk

220
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:05,634
You embarrass me

221
00:26:05,844 --> 00:26:08,472
You're overestimating me

222
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,106
Listen

223
00:26:11,984 --> 00:26:14,817
I'm not a man
with any special skill

224
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:18,289
But I've had plenty of experience
in battles,

225
00:26:19,157 --> 00:26:21,489
losing battles, all of them

226
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:24,658
In short, that's all I am

227
00:26:25,163 --> 00:26:27,688
Drop such an idea
for your own good

228
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:30,724
No, sir.
My decision has been made!

229
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:33,234
I'll follow you, sir

230
00:26:33,472 --> 00:26:34,666
I forbid it

231
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:38,369
I can't afford to take
a kid with me

232
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,780
What do you want?

233
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:02,397
What do you want?

234
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:12,504
You are rude!

235
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:15,912
Mind your own business, kid!

236
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,718
Are you a samurai?

237
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:26,485
Sure!

238
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:30,626
I wonder

239
00:27:57,022 --> 00:27:58,216
Who is he?

240
00:28:04,763 --> 00:28:06,162
Pay no attention

241
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,850
Please, sir! I fever to ask!

242
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:31,288
Why don't you go home?

243
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:37,694
Haven't you had enough yet?
After he's fed, he'll leave

244
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:44,065
It's impossible

245
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:45,892
Sir!

246
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:49,138
Why not arm them with...?

247
00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:50,638
I thought of that, too

248
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:51,969
But sir

249
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,511
This would not be a game

250
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,978
A band of forty bandits!

251
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:07,250
Two or three samurai
could accomplish nothing

252
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:24,097
Defense is harder than offense

253
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:28,443
Mountains in back of the village?

254
00:29:30,482 --> 00:29:31,449
Can horses get over them?

255
00:29:42,494 --> 00:29:43,483
Fields in front

256
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,661
The village is wide open
to horsemen...

257
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,494
until the fields are flooded

258
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,229
One guard for each
direction takes four

259
00:29:56,842 --> 00:29:57,900
Two more as a reserve

260
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:05,548
You'll need at least seven,
including me

261
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:10,548
We can afford seven, eh?

262
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,219
The Grandad said "four,"
didn't he?

263
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:15,388
But three more

264
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:16,957
Wait!

265
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,722
I haven't said "Yes!"

266
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:20,894
I'm only thinking

267
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:26,697
In the first place, it's not easy
to find seven reliable samurai

268
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:32,303
Especially when the total reward
adds up to three meager meals

269
00:30:35,147 --> 00:30:36,910
And the fun of it,
if I may say so

270
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:38,976
Besides...

271
00:30:40,185 --> 00:30:42,312
I'm tired of fighting

272
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:45,188
Maybe it's my age

273
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:09,809
I'm glad I wasn't
born a farmer!

274
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:13,141
A dog is luckier!

275
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:17,785
Shit! Take it from me!
Go hang yourselves!

276
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:20,925
You shut your mouth!

277
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:23,617
What? I'm just talking straight!

278
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:25,027
Talking straight?

279
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:27,965
Don't you have
any pity for them?

280
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:29,626
Don't make me laugh!

281
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:31,795
Do you have any pity?

282
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:36,104
If you do, why don't
you help them?

283
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:43,043
Want a fight?

284
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:47,348
Stop it!

285
00:31:53,858 --> 00:31:54,517
Stop it!

286
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:04,131
Hey! Samurai!

287
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:07,967
Look at this!
This is for you!

288
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:12,842
Know what those suckers eat?
Millet!

289
00:32:13,578 --> 00:32:16,979
They're feeding you on rice,
and living on millet

290
00:32:17,315 --> 00:32:20,375
They're giving their best!

291
00:32:23,088 --> 00:32:24,453
I see

292
00:32:25,223 --> 00:32:26,019
Say no more!

293
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:34,223
I won't waste your food

294
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:51,806
Look!
Manzo's coming home!

295
00:33:07,432 --> 00:33:08,626
Where are Rikichi and Yohei?

296
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:11,462
Still looking for samurai!

297
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:13,331
You really think
samurai would come?

298
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:14,870
Yes, they're coming. Seven

299
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,473
Yes, seven

300
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:21,412
Hmm... seven!

301
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:26,584
You said "four," so I opposed

302
00:33:28,553 --> 00:33:33,616
I thought we'd probably
have to hire ten

303
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:38,386
But, if I told you that,
you'd bring fifteen

304
00:33:39,698 --> 00:33:42,724
See what I mean?

305
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:47,362
Grandad! I am worried!

306
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:55,109
Our girls are crazy
about samurai

307
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:59,005
The villagers won't like
the samurai to get them

308
00:34:03,722 --> 00:34:06,623
Fool! Have you
forgotten the bandits?

309
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:11,117
What's the use of worrying
about your beard,

310
00:34:11,296 --> 00:34:13,161
when your head's
about to be taken?

311
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:38,649
You need my help?

312
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:41,285
To fight whom?

313
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:43,452
Katsuishiro!

314
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:58,205
Hold your weapon tightly

315
00:35:00,412 --> 00:35:02,710
And hit him as he comes

316
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,025
Hit as hard as you can!

317
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:47,358
Splendid!

318
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,559
Please forgive us

319
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:53,120
My name is Kambei Shimada

320
00:35:53,331 --> 00:35:57,392
I must find some talented men,
right away

321
00:35:57,735 --> 00:35:59,362
Forgive us

322
00:35:59,771 --> 00:36:01,261
What is this?

323
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:04,037
Intolerable! Outrageous!

324
00:36:04,242 --> 00:36:06,938
Forgive me. You see,

325
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:11,571
a war is about to start
with a band of bandits

326
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:16,247
What Clan?

327
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:19,221
Our employer,
as a matter of fact

328
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,120
is a village of farmers

329
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:27,286
A job promising no pay or reward,

330
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:31,326
except three square meals
while we're on the job

331
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:32,936
What stupidity!

332
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:36,033
My ambition is a bit bigger

333
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:39,109
I'm sorry

334
00:36:40,445 --> 00:36:42,174
Is that final?

335
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:43,813
Yes!

336
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:53,489
What a big loss, sir!

337
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:55,358
So alert a fencer!

338
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:43,304
What's the matter?

339
00:37:43,841 --> 00:37:48,301
That samurai is all right.
But I'm worried about the other six

340
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:50,310
Don't be foolish!

341
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:54,483
See them first.
Then, start worrying!

342
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:11,529
Try him!

343
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:32,484
One moment, sir!

344
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:36,490
Like the last time?

345
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:42,928
Yes. For your training

346
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:16,833
Please! No jokes

347
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,602
Forgive me

348
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:36,347
Interesting

349
00:39:39,357 --> 00:39:40,756
But...

350
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:44,527
I realize that the farmers
are suffering

351
00:39:45,196 --> 00:39:49,189
I think I understand
why you accepted

352
00:39:49,634 --> 00:39:54,094
But, I'll accept because
your character fascinates me

353
00:39:55,707 --> 00:40:00,041
The deepest friendship often
comes through a chance meeting

354
00:40:06,117 --> 00:40:07,379
Your name?

355
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:09,277
Gorobei Katayama

356
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:10,920
Sounds strong, but...

357
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:24,761
Yohei, what's wrong!
Hurry up!

358
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:31,406
Come on!

359
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:36,602
What's wrong, Yohei?

360
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,551
The rice is gone!

361
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,056
You fool!

362
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:55,892
So I told you so...

363
00:40:56,601 --> 00:40:58,831
I tried my best to watch it!

364
00:41:03,608 --> 00:41:07,510
At night I slept,
holding on to it!

365
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:14,747
I'll get some from home!

366
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,515
But, what will we do
until you get back?

367
00:41:20,558 --> 00:41:24,688
It's all gone,
except just a handful

368
00:42:17,181 --> 00:42:18,773
Don't be silly!

369
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,250
Here he comes!

370
00:42:27,558 --> 00:42:29,924
This is wonderful!
Thank Heaven!

371
00:42:33,064 --> 00:42:35,294
It's so good
to find you alive!

372
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:38,697
I'd give you up for lost!

373
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:48,102
How did you get away?

374
00:42:48,512 --> 00:42:52,004
I laid low in the ditch,
under the water plants

375
00:42:54,652 --> 00:42:58,383
When the castle burned down,
and fell upon me,

376
00:42:58,556 --> 00:43:00,456
I thought that was my end!

377
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:03,389
Were you terrified?

378
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:07,524
Not particularly

379
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:12,467
Are you fed up with fighting?

380
00:43:21,979 --> 00:43:22,843
As a matter of fact,

381
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:25,275
I'm preparing for a tough war

382
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,479
It will bring us neither money
nor fame. Want to join?

383
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,914
Yes!

384
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:33,356
Maybe we die this time

385
00:43:54,312 --> 00:43:56,177
I never knew they were so scarce

386
00:43:56,514 --> 00:43:58,607
What are you after, sir?

387
00:43:58,883 --> 00:44:00,612
Samurai

388
00:44:02,653 --> 00:44:06,749
There's one in my yard,
but poor quality

389
00:44:07,224 --> 00:44:10,921
I was astonished
by his gay indifference

390
00:44:11,629 --> 00:44:14,097
He came in saying:
"Feed me. I have no money

391
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:16,859
but I'll cut your firewood."

392
00:44:23,507 --> 00:44:26,101
I liked his frankness

393
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:09,644
Haven't you ever seen
firewood cut?

394
00:45:09,854 --> 00:45:12,152
You seem to enjoy it

395
00:45:12,923 --> 00:45:15,790
Oh, that's my nature

396
00:45:21,198 --> 00:45:22,495
You're good

397
00:45:23,634 --> 00:45:25,534
But I'm better
at killing enemies

398
00:45:26,203 --> 00:45:27,500
Killed many?

399
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:31,634
Well - It's impossible
to kill 'em all

400
00:45:35,746 --> 00:45:38,044
So I usually run away

401
00:45:40,651 --> 00:45:42,642
A splendid principle!

402
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:45,383
Thank you

403
00:45:51,796 --> 00:45:53,855
Incidentally,

404
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:57,228
Interested in killing
thirty bandits?

405
00:46:16,153 --> 00:46:17,177
Let's begin

406
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:51,006
Too bad. A tie

407
00:47:51,815 --> 00:47:52,804
No

408
00:47:53,717 --> 00:47:54,911
I won

409
00:47:58,222 --> 00:47:59,280
You did?

410
00:48:01,192 --> 00:48:03,285
If we had fought seriously,
you'd have been cut and dead

411
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,167
Let's see!

412
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:11,625
No use

413
00:48:12,002 --> 00:48:13,196
Don't you see?

414
00:48:13,537 --> 00:48:16,233
A real sword will kill you.
It's no use

415
00:48:17,007 --> 00:48:18,133
Wait!

416
00:48:23,547 --> 00:48:25,845
Halt! You can say
whatever you want

417
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:05,885
What a waste

418
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:08,985
It's so obvious

419
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:42,823
Find any?

420
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:48,320
Missed one

421
00:49:48,565 --> 00:49:51,033
A first-class swordsman

422
00:49:51,602 --> 00:49:53,399
A lost fish looks big

423
00:49:53,837 --> 00:49:59,469
But, I saw his prowess
with my own eyes

424
00:50:07,084 --> 00:50:08,278
He is terrific!

425
00:50:08,652 --> 00:50:12,554
A man interested only
in perfecting his skill

426
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:15,190
So his answer was "No!"

427
00:50:15,526 --> 00:50:17,551
Too bad!

428
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,728
I told him where
to find me, though

429
00:50:22,466 --> 00:50:23,899
And you?

430
00:50:24,902 --> 00:50:26,199
I caught one

431
00:50:27,237 --> 00:50:29,831
His fencing is... second class

432
00:50:31,842 --> 00:50:34,174
But, quite a character

433
00:50:35,145 --> 00:50:36,976
A cheerful fellow

434
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:40,050
Good company in adversity

435
00:50:41,652 --> 00:50:42,619
Much obliged

436
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:48,020
I caught one too,
to tell you the truth

437
00:50:48,258 --> 00:50:50,453
That one dressed like a peddler?

438
00:50:50,828 --> 00:50:53,592
Yes. He was my right
hand man for years

439
00:50:59,536 --> 00:51:00,764
I'll bring clean water

440
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:09,707
I'm Heinachi Hayashida, a fencer
of the Wood Cut School

441
00:51:16,587 --> 00:51:19,181
Well, three more to find

442
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,479
Three?

443
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:22,122
Two

444
00:51:22,426 --> 00:51:24,018
Can't take a kid

445
00:51:26,096 --> 00:51:26,926
Sir

446
00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:28,559
I know

447
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:31,558
I know your line

448
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:35,396
I was a young man like you, once

449
00:51:37,508 --> 00:51:39,476
"Train yourself

450
00:51:39,843 --> 00:51:43,040
"Distinguish yourself in war

451
00:51:44,515 --> 00:51:47,780
"Because somebody,
maybe a war lord!"

452
00:51:48,352 --> 00:51:50,980
But, time flies

453
00:51:51,855 --> 00:51:55,518
Before your dream materializes
you get gray hair

454
00:51:57,694 --> 00:51:59,161
By that time,

455
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:04,524
your parents and friends
are dead and gone

456
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:56,242
Go back home,
leave in the morning

457
00:52:56,453 --> 00:52:58,318
you had enough training
the last few days

458
00:52:58,956 --> 00:53:00,287
Good experience

459
00:53:16,206 --> 00:53:17,173
Please, sir!

460
00:53:17,341 --> 00:53:18,933
Take him, by all means.
Please!

461
00:53:19,176 --> 00:53:20,108
But...

462
00:53:20,677 --> 00:53:24,238
Do! Even though
you call him a kid

463
00:53:24,882 --> 00:53:26,975
Kids are often more
willing than grownups

464
00:53:28,418 --> 00:53:31,353
Provided that we treated him
like a grownup

465
00:53:32,523 --> 00:53:35,287
So, let's treat him like one

466
00:53:41,598 --> 00:53:43,088
Two more

467
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:47,398
Just one more, I think

468
00:53:49,773 --> 00:53:50,705
Hello!

469
00:53:53,844 --> 00:53:55,334
You've come!

470
00:53:57,047 --> 00:53:58,241
Thank you

471
00:53:59,383 --> 00:54:01,476
- And...?
- We leave tomorrow

472
00:54:05,088 --> 00:54:05,986
Tomorrow?

473
00:54:07,925 --> 00:54:10,985
Let's forget the seventh.
We have no time to lose!

474
00:54:14,831 --> 00:54:15,957
Well

475
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:20,597
Sir!

476
00:54:21,972 --> 00:54:23,667
- Sir!
- That's all right

477
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:28,273
- Sir!
- I know. Don't mention it!

478
00:54:33,183 --> 00:54:35,947
Hey! I found a samurai!

479
00:54:36,153 --> 00:54:37,677
A real tough one!

480
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:41,391
A fee-ro-shus one!
He is like a wild dog

481
00:54:41,592 --> 00:54:44,686
He drank with him later

482
00:54:44,861 --> 00:54:47,489
I asked him. He's coming!

483
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:51,996
Shall I...?

484
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,949
What are you doing?

485
00:55:08,552 --> 00:55:09,712
Testing

486
00:55:12,222 --> 00:55:14,087
That's not fair!

487
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:15,450
Just watch

488
00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:17,724
A good samurai will dodge it

489
00:55:17,894 --> 00:55:20,089
But he's drunk

490
00:55:20,263 --> 00:55:22,754
A real samurai would never get
so drunk

491
00:55:27,971 --> 00:55:28,995
Here I am!

492
00:55:37,914 --> 00:55:39,575
See, I told you so!

493
00:55:47,591 --> 00:55:49,491
Who hit me?

494
00:56:56,393 --> 00:56:57,382
Oh! It's you

495
00:57:01,098 --> 00:57:03,760
I remember your head!
I even see it in my dreams!

496
00:57:06,737 --> 00:57:14,644
You had the nerve to ask me
if I was a samurai!

497
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:28,522
Look! Though clad in rags,
I'm a real samurai!

498
00:57:32,763 --> 00:57:36,756
I've been looking for you
ever since that time!

499
00:57:38,401 --> 00:57:40,266
Wanted to show you this!

500
00:57:48,912 --> 00:57:49,640
Look at this!

501
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:55,778
You'll know... I belong to
a respectable samurai family

502
00:58:15,338 --> 00:58:16,600
This one is me!

503
00:58:18,742 --> 00:58:21,006
Kikuchiyo? Is that your name?

504
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:22,641
Yes, sir!

505
00:58:23,847 --> 00:58:26,839
"Born on February 17,
the 2nd year of Tensho"

506
00:58:29,986 --> 00:58:31,010
What's so funny?

507
00:58:32,989 --> 00:58:34,957
You don't look thirteen!

508
00:58:37,093 --> 00:58:40,460
Listen! If you are the Kikuchiyo
mentioned here

509
00:58:40,864 --> 00:58:42,855
you must be thirteen years old

510
00:58:48,104 --> 00:58:49,901
Where did you steal this?

511
00:58:51,675 --> 00:58:52,767
Steal?

512
00:59:01,251 --> 00:59:02,240
To hell with samurai!

513
00:59:06,189 --> 00:59:06,848
Damn!

514
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:27,941
Steady, Thirteen!

515
01:00:12,889 --> 01:00:13,821
Sir Kikuchiyo!

516
01:00:19,462 --> 01:00:21,089
Courage, Thirteen!

517
01:00:30,807 --> 01:00:32,741
To hell with samurai!

518
01:00:50,093 --> 01:00:51,651
Is he really samurai?

519
01:00:51,861 --> 01:00:53,726
He thinks he is

520
01:01:16,987 --> 01:01:18,079
"Take good care of this!"

521
01:01:20,991 --> 01:01:22,219
Take me with you!

522
01:02:04,234 --> 01:02:05,565
What's the matter, Dad?

523
01:02:22,852 --> 01:02:26,583
Why do you stare at me like that?

524
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:38,991
Shino! Cut your hair short!

525
01:02:39,636 --> 01:02:42,104
Cut your hair! Dress like a boy!

526
01:02:44,474 --> 01:02:45,270
I don't understand!

527
01:02:45,742 --> 01:02:49,007
Cut, I tell you!
I tell you because I love you!

528
01:02:49,212 --> 01:02:52,875
Samurai are coming! You don't know
what they'll do to you

529
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:55,051
- Come and cut your hair.
- No, I won't!

530
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:31,013
But Manzo's seen those samurai!

531
01:03:31,888 --> 01:03:33,913
And he cut her hair!

532
01:03:34,357 --> 01:03:37,588
You're not worried because
yours are boys, but...

533
01:03:37,827 --> 01:03:40,990
- I get it.
- So you keep my daughter.

534
01:03:41,164 --> 01:03:43,564
She'll be safer at your place

535
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:47,029
Fool!
I'm talking about Manzo!

536
01:03:47,537 --> 01:03:50,370
He says he's worried
about our village

537
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:54,301
But he's only worried
about his daughter! Damn!

538
01:04:14,164 --> 01:04:15,791
You're a prize fool!

539
01:04:16,766 --> 01:04:20,964
All who have young daughters
are terrified

540
01:04:22,939 --> 01:04:24,770
What are we to do?

541
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:27,570
The samurai are coming any day now!

542
01:04:28,878 --> 01:04:31,438
Come! Let's go see the Grandad!

543
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:36,282
Don't stand there! Go!

544
01:04:38,454 --> 01:04:40,012
Get going!

545
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:45,188
We should do something before
those samurai get here!

546
01:04:51,601 --> 01:04:52,932
Still following us!

547
01:06:38,741 --> 01:06:40,800
I don't see him!

548
01:06:41,811 --> 01:06:43,278
Given up?

549
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,839
Isn't it strange?
Now, I sort of...

550
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:50,081
miss him!

551
01:06:56,092 --> 01:06:57,252
This way!

552
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,761
Sheeyit!

553
01:07:15,645 --> 01:07:17,442
So that's our castle, eh?

554
01:07:18,648 --> 01:07:21,208
Huh! I'd hate to die
in a dung heap, though

555
01:07:21,484 --> 01:07:23,816
We aren't asking you to

556
01:07:42,472 --> 01:07:44,463
Here we are!

557
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,403
I brought the samurai!

558
01:07:58,254 --> 01:07:59,812
What's wrong?

559
01:08:00,022 --> 01:08:01,580
Here are the samurai!

560
01:08:07,697 --> 01:08:09,062
Huh!

561
01:08:13,836 --> 01:08:15,360
What's wrong?

562
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:31,843
Well, what kind of hospitality
is this?

563
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:37,593
What does this mean?

564
01:08:40,496 --> 01:08:44,592
Hey! What's the matter?
Welcome your guests!

565
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:02,550
Let's go see Grandad

566
01:09:02,718 --> 01:09:06,484
He handles all our affairs

567
01:09:06,656 --> 01:09:08,055
Village patriarch, eh?

568
01:09:09,926 --> 01:09:12,053
He's granting us an audience

569
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:14,052
What an honor!

570
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:19,766
Let's go

571
01:10:32,341 --> 01:10:37,438
They're being very foolish indeed

572
01:10:38,147 --> 01:10:44,211
Farmers are always worrying
about one thing or another

573
01:10:44,654 --> 01:10:48,647
Rains, dry weather, winds

574
01:10:49,592 --> 01:10:53,790
In other words, they wake up
worrying and go to bed the same way

575
01:10:53,963 --> 01:10:55,988
Today's no exception

576
01:10:56,666 --> 01:11:02,366
They're just scared,
meaninglessly scared, that's all

577
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:06,474
But, listen

578
01:11:07,209 --> 01:11:10,007
Why are they afraid of us?

579
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,675
Yet they expect us to do something
for them?

580
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:25,488
The bandits!

581
01:11:35,504 --> 01:11:37,904
Please! Samurai, please!

582
01:11:45,147 --> 01:11:47,115
Help! Bandits are coming!

583
01:11:54,657 --> 01:11:56,022
Please help!

584
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:12,329
Keep calm!

585
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:13,338
Calm down!

586
01:12:14,744 --> 01:12:16,644
Answer me clearly!

587
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:20,106
From which direction
are they coming?

588
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:22,374
From mountain!

589
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:25,050
From front road!

590
01:12:26,789 --> 01:12:29,019
Those who saw bandits,
step forward!

591
01:12:29,825 --> 01:12:32,055
Who saw bandits?

592
01:12:33,029 --> 01:12:34,758
Who beat the alarm?

593
01:12:35,598 --> 01:12:36,690
I did!

594
01:12:50,246 --> 01:12:51,645
Don't be scared!

595
01:12:53,883 --> 01:12:56,351
No bandits are coming!

596
01:13:02,525 --> 01:13:03,583
You suckers!

597
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:08,087
You welcomed us as you would
a plague!

598
01:13:08,431 --> 01:13:10,626
But when you heard the alarm...

599
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,995
Oh! Samurai!

600
01:13:14,737 --> 01:13:16,898
You turned to worship us

601
01:13:22,111 --> 01:13:23,669
Fools!

602
01:13:42,431 --> 01:13:44,456
Any objection, Grandad?

603
01:13:44,867 --> 01:13:46,266
No

604
01:13:46,936 --> 01:13:48,096
It's all right now

605
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:57,138
Well, looks like maybe
he's useful after all

606
01:13:57,546 --> 01:13:58,774
So now we're seven, eh?

607
01:14:07,490 --> 01:14:09,355
Sorry this place is so filthy

608
01:14:09,892 --> 01:14:12,258
But, where will you live?

609
01:14:13,562 --> 01:14:15,257
I'll sleep in the stable

610
01:14:15,431 --> 01:14:16,659
With horses?

611
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,628
No! The bandits took them last year

612
01:14:38,354 --> 01:14:41,687
A stable is a nice place
to sleep with one's wife

613
01:14:46,262 --> 01:14:47,820
I have no wife!

614
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:49,723
Fool!

615
01:15:16,992 --> 01:15:18,619
What's your real name?

616
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:22,920
I don't remember

617
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:25,700
Give me a good name

618
01:15:26,769 --> 01:15:28,498
Kikuchiyo!

619
01:15:30,072 --> 01:15:31,733
It becomes you

620
01:15:52,895 --> 01:15:55,386
How would you attack this village?

621
01:15:55,965 --> 01:15:57,865
I'd charge down from the mountain

622
01:16:00,035 --> 01:16:02,435
Down this road?
I'd do the same

623
01:16:03,138 --> 01:16:05,470
WEST

624
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:21,980
How would you defend?

625
01:16:22,858 --> 01:16:24,519
Shichiroji sure knows his business

626
01:16:25,861 --> 01:16:27,226
Look at those logs

627
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:29,754
He plans a fence

628
01:16:30,599 --> 01:16:31,998
Your old right hand man, eh?

629
01:17:02,665 --> 01:17:04,064
Remember!

630
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:06,733
A war is run

631
01:17:08,003 --> 01:17:10,369
We run, both in offense and defense

632
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:12,864
When you can't run,
it's time to die

633
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:35,157
SOUTH

634
01:17:47,843 --> 01:17:50,937
After the harvest, we'll flood here

635
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,046
Then this will be well defended

636
01:17:54,783 --> 01:17:57,183
But will we have time to do that?

637
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:10,458
Spear! Go ahead and spear!

638
01:18:10,699 --> 01:18:12,428
Look! I'm a bandit!

639
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:21,136
Come on!

640
01:18:30,586 --> 01:18:31,553
Next!

641
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:04,245
EAST

642
01:19:08,323 --> 01:19:10,018
We'll destroy this bridge

643
01:19:10,426 --> 01:19:12,291
This border will then be safe

644
01:19:20,369 --> 01:19:22,564
What about those houses?

645
01:19:30,312 --> 01:19:32,439
Have to be evacuated

646
01:19:37,386 --> 01:19:38,785
That mill, too?

647
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:44,425
That old man is stubborn, you know

648
01:19:50,899 --> 01:19:52,230
Remember

649
01:19:52,835 --> 01:19:55,770
You're afraid of the enemies

650
01:19:56,004 --> 01:19:59,337
But, they're afraid of you, too!

651
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:30,694
You're splendid!

652
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:33,999
Splendid scarecrows!

653
01:20:36,612 --> 01:20:39,843
But they're men, not sparrows,
not crows!

654
01:20:49,158 --> 01:20:51,524
You, chewing that cud!

655
01:20:51,693 --> 01:20:53,024
Stop it!

656
01:20:56,798 --> 01:20:58,425
You are not a cow!

657
01:21:09,111 --> 01:21:11,807
You on the end! Step forward!

658
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:16,141
I mean you!

659
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:18,284
You!

660
01:21:39,508 --> 01:21:41,533
If you want to watch, bring money

661
01:22:00,662 --> 01:22:01,993
What is this?

662
01:22:03,098 --> 01:22:04,895
A spear, sir

663
01:22:06,335 --> 01:22:08,462
Where did you get it?

664
01:22:09,871 --> 01:22:11,600
Grown on a bush?

665
01:22:14,776 --> 01:22:15,936
I know!

666
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:18,105
Samurai on the run!

667
01:22:19,047 --> 01:22:22,346
If you have one, the others
must have them also

668
01:22:23,986 --> 01:22:25,044
Have you?

669
01:22:25,654 --> 01:22:27,178
Do - you - have - spears?

670
01:22:36,898 --> 01:22:40,026
NORTH

671
01:22:47,976 --> 01:22:52,106
Looks peaceful here.
But a real danger spot

672
01:23:28,884 --> 01:23:31,182
Katsushiro!
We're leaving now!

673
01:23:31,353 --> 01:23:32,251
Yes, Sir! I'm coming!

674
01:23:40,996 --> 01:23:42,224
Still a child

675
01:24:44,459 --> 01:24:46,859
Are you one of the villagers?

676
01:24:51,967 --> 01:24:52,831
A girl?

677
01:24:56,838 --> 01:24:58,135
A boy?

678
01:24:59,908 --> 01:25:01,136
If you are a boy,
why aren't you drilling?

679
01:25:02,577 --> 01:25:05,774
Picking flowers during
such a crisis!

680
01:25:07,048 --> 01:25:08,072
Come!

681
01:26:22,123 --> 01:26:26,651
Good! Good!
Problem is here.

682
01:26:33,668 --> 01:26:34,794
Hey! What are you doing!

683
01:26:44,179 --> 01:26:45,578
A big haul!

684
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:53,387
What have you got?

685
01:26:53,588 --> 01:26:55,852
Taken from a samurai
on the run

686
01:26:57,659 --> 01:26:59,024
Where did you get those?

687
01:26:59,928 --> 01:27:00,860
In this village?

688
01:27:01,029 --> 01:27:02,360
At Manzo's

689
01:27:16,344 --> 01:27:17,709
Don't like them?

690
01:27:20,215 --> 01:27:21,910
A real fine one!

691
01:27:24,252 --> 01:27:29,019
What's the matter? You wanted
these things, didn't you?

692
01:27:30,191 --> 01:27:31,453
Shame on you!

693
01:27:33,428 --> 01:27:36,124
They stripped those
from samurai they murdered

694
01:27:36,798 --> 01:27:39,323
- I know.
- How dare you...!

695
01:27:41,636 --> 01:27:44,628
One who has never been
hunted would not understand

696
01:27:58,420 --> 01:27:59,387
Go away! It's nothing!

697
01:28:24,412 --> 01:28:28,712
I'd like to kill every
farmer in this village!

698
01:28:42,897 --> 01:28:44,421
A fine idea!

699
01:28:47,702 --> 01:28:49,192
Hey, you!

700
01:28:49,804 --> 01:28:51,669
What do you all think of farmers?

701
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,132
Saints?

702
01:28:55,143 --> 01:28:56,303
Bah!

703
01:28:56,778 --> 01:28:59,474
They're foxy beasts!

704
01:29:05,153 --> 01:29:09,920
They say: "We've no rice, we've
no wheat. We've got nothing!"

705
01:29:12,027 --> 01:29:13,824
But they have!

706
01:29:14,562 --> 01:29:16,154
They have everything!

707
01:29:17,465 --> 01:29:19,365
Dig under the floors!

708
01:29:19,534 --> 01:29:21,331
Or search the barns!

709
01:29:21,603 --> 01:29:23,332
You'll find plenty!

710
01:29:23,505 --> 01:29:24,597
Rice!

711
01:29:25,073 --> 01:29:26,563
Salt! Beans! Sake!

712
01:29:31,913 --> 01:29:33,710
Look into the canyons!

713
01:29:33,915 --> 01:29:35,143
Hidden farms!

714
01:29:36,184 --> 01:29:39,551
They pose as saints
but are full of lies!

715
01:29:40,922 --> 01:29:43,652
If they smell a battle,
they hunt the defeated!

716
01:29:46,461 --> 01:29:47,758
Listen!

717
01:29:48,096 --> 01:29:49,791
Farmers are-

718
01:29:49,964 --> 01:29:53,161
stingy, foxy, blubbering

719
01:29:53,334 --> 01:29:56,735
mean, stupid and, murderous!

720
01:29:57,639 --> 01:30:00,073
God damn!
That's what they are!

721
01:30:04,546 --> 01:30:07,208
But then!
Who made them such beasts?

722
01:30:08,283 --> 01:30:11,275
You did!
You samurai did it!

723
01:30:21,162 --> 01:30:23,153
You burn their villages!

724
01:30:23,364 --> 01:30:24,763
Destroy their farms!

725
01:30:24,933 --> 01:30:26,332
Steal their food!

726
01:30:26,801 --> 01:30:28,860
Force them to labor!

727
01:30:29,037 --> 01:30:30,504
Take their women!

728
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:32,563
And kill them if they resist!

729
01:30:32,741 --> 01:30:36,438
So what should farmers do?

730
01:30:38,012 --> 01:30:40,947
Damn... Damn...

731
01:31:16,818 --> 01:31:19,753
You are a farmer's son.
Aren't you?

732
01:31:58,359 --> 01:32:01,226
Has... has anything
happened, sir?

733
01:32:01,896 --> 01:32:03,796
Nothing, Grandad

734
01:32:03,998 --> 01:32:04,987
Everything is all right

735
01:33:11,132 --> 01:33:14,226
I sleep here from tonight

736
01:33:15,803 --> 01:33:18,101
I don't like their company

737
01:33:19,741 --> 01:33:20,969
Fool!

738
01:33:21,542 --> 01:33:23,373
Don't make yourself small!

739
01:33:23,912 --> 01:33:25,573
This is your home?

740
01:33:26,648 --> 01:33:29,446
You gave them your house
and you sleep here?

741
01:33:29,651 --> 01:33:30,982
Scared to death!

742
01:33:31,152 --> 01:33:32,119
Go to sleep!

743
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:50,899
It's like old times

744
01:34:09,724 --> 01:34:11,191
It's so quiet

745
01:34:14,429 --> 01:34:19,264
I can't imagine the mountains
being infested with bandits

746
01:34:21,369 --> 01:34:24,270
Sheeyit!
If I had woman now...

747
01:34:33,948 --> 01:34:36,109
- Where to?
- The mountain?

748
01:34:36,317 --> 01:34:37,284
To practice

749
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:40,544
No women up there!

750
01:34:42,557 --> 01:34:44,548
Sometimes you sound
pretty sharp

751
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:47,887
What are you making now?

752
01:34:48,863 --> 01:34:50,296
Our banner

753
01:34:51,432 --> 01:34:52,956
In battle,

754
01:34:53,534 --> 01:34:56,401
we'll need something to wave

755
01:35:01,876 --> 01:35:02,968
What does it mean?

756
01:35:04,178 --> 01:35:08,205
This says "Farm."
Farmers. This village

757
01:35:09,384 --> 01:35:11,716
- These circles?
- Us

758
01:35:12,754 --> 01:35:14,619
Only six, eh?

759
01:35:14,789 --> 01:35:16,086
I'm out?

760
01:35:17,158 --> 01:35:19,353
The triangle represents you,
Sir. Kikuchiyo

761
01:36:41,642 --> 01:36:42,973
It's rice.

762
01:36:43,377 --> 01:36:45,777
- Eat it.
- But...

763
01:36:45,947 --> 01:36:49,348
I tasted millet,
for the first time

764
01:36:50,852 --> 01:36:52,683
It was terrible

765
01:36:54,422 --> 01:36:56,287
Go ahead

766
01:37:07,368 --> 01:37:10,201
Don't be shy.
Want to be alone?

767
01:37:11,172 --> 01:37:13,037
I won't eat it

768
01:37:13,241 --> 01:37:14,799
Why?

769
01:37:14,976 --> 01:37:15,943
I brought it for you

770
01:37:16,210 --> 01:37:23,139
I'd rather give it
to Kyuemon's Granny

771
01:37:24,452 --> 01:37:26,044
Kyuemon's Granny?

772
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:50,775
I'm not hungry now

773
01:37:50,945 --> 01:37:52,276
I'll eat later

774
01:37:52,647 --> 01:37:54,274
You eat

775
01:37:55,216 --> 01:37:57,047
I'll save mine

776
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:01,186
What's going on?
Tell me!

777
01:38:11,666 --> 01:38:13,395
This is terrible

778
01:38:14,936 --> 01:38:16,460
No relatives?

779
01:38:17,238 --> 01:38:19,604
No, sir. The bandits...

780
01:38:26,314 --> 01:38:32,412
I wish I could die right away

781
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:36,319
I want to die soon,

782
01:38:36,490 --> 01:38:41,928
to escape from this misery

783
01:38:43,497 --> 01:38:45,124
But, then

784
01:38:46,133 --> 01:38:49,398
even in the world to come,

785
01:38:49,704 --> 01:38:54,437
there must be great misery,
I'm afraid

786
01:38:56,344 --> 01:38:58,209
There's not!

787
01:38:58,579 --> 01:39:02,811
No war, no bandits,
in the next world

788
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:05,277
No misery, either

789
01:39:05,686 --> 01:39:07,950
How do you know?
Ever been there?

790
01:39:09,290 --> 01:39:10,723
Why yell so much?

791
01:39:11,292 --> 01:39:13,351
I hate all wretched people!

792
01:39:13,527 --> 01:39:15,085
I feel disgusted with them!

793
01:39:21,902 --> 01:39:23,597
Damn!

794
01:39:23,771 --> 01:39:25,500
I want to do something

795
01:39:25,906 --> 01:39:28,374
Save that feeling
for the bandits

796
01:39:44,892 --> 01:39:46,655
Didn't you...

797
01:39:48,529 --> 01:39:50,929
Did you...

798
01:39:51,999 --> 01:39:58,165
Did you, see me today,
over there, with...

799
01:39:58,339 --> 01:39:58,896
The girl?

800
01:39:59,073 --> 01:40:00,802
Yes

801
01:40:01,042 --> 01:40:03,203
Why didn't you tell...?

802
01:40:03,377 --> 01:40:05,004
You want me to?

803
01:40:20,394 --> 01:40:23,090
Give us some rice!

804
01:40:24,065 --> 01:40:26,158
Give us white rice!

805
01:40:31,539 --> 01:40:32,233
We have no rice!

806
01:40:38,779 --> 01:40:41,907
Don't shout,
you'll get hungry

807
01:40:42,216 --> 01:40:45,049
Give us rice!
The white rice ball!

808
01:40:47,888 --> 01:40:50,823
Listen, you brats!

809
01:40:53,094 --> 01:40:55,688
This is all
we can give you

810
01:40:56,430 --> 01:40:58,694
If we give you more,
we'll be...

811
01:41:02,803 --> 01:41:04,168
See?

812
01:41:05,373 --> 01:41:07,739
Say! Hasn't any one of you
got a pretty sister?

813
01:41:10,978 --> 01:41:12,878
Anyone?

814
01:41:15,082 --> 01:41:18,245
When are you going to harvest?

815
01:41:20,221 --> 01:41:22,416
After ten days

816
01:41:22,590 --> 01:41:24,990
At top speed how long
will it take?

817
01:41:26,761 --> 01:41:29,457
Three days, at least.

818
01:41:30,431 --> 01:41:33,366
I want to flood it, then

819
01:41:34,201 --> 01:41:36,897
We need a moat
at the south border,

820
01:41:37,071 --> 01:41:39,471
so no horsemen can approach

821
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:42,234
This moat need not be wide

822
01:41:42,943 --> 01:41:48,472
Well, we'll dig a waterway
and flood the farm

823
01:41:48,716 --> 01:41:49,273
The work can be done in one day

824
01:41:49,483 --> 01:41:51,212
Thanks

825
01:41:51,952 --> 01:41:54,182
And there's another thing

826
01:41:54,622 --> 01:41:57,523
Those three houses
and this mill

827
01:41:58,492 --> 01:42:00,960
must be evacuated when
the harvest is completed

828
01:42:04,532 --> 01:42:06,090
What? Me evacuate?

829
01:42:13,574 --> 01:42:14,836
I'm sorry

830
01:42:17,578 --> 01:42:19,045
We can't help it

831
01:42:21,182 --> 01:42:24,413
We can't cover this big an area

832
01:42:46,307 --> 01:42:47,467
Listen!

833
01:42:47,975 --> 01:42:50,000
The crops will soon be harvested

834
01:42:50,177 --> 01:42:52,145
Then, the bandits will come

835
01:42:52,313 --> 01:42:53,837
Let's be ready

836
01:42:54,148 --> 01:42:55,775
From now on

837
01:42:55,983 --> 01:42:57,644
we must be on the alert

838
01:42:58,352 --> 01:43:01,219
We'll harvest in groups,
not individually

839
01:43:02,490 --> 01:43:05,789
From tomorrow,
you'll live in groups

840
01:43:06,961 --> 01:43:11,159
Remember! You move as a group,
not as individuals

841
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,724
Listen, men!

842
01:43:16,370 --> 01:43:19,771
Love your wives plenty tonight

843
01:43:40,361 --> 01:43:43,762
It's stupid!

844
01:43:44,632 --> 01:43:46,725
Come, neighbors!

845
01:43:49,837 --> 01:43:52,806
Throw them away!

846
01:43:53,007 --> 01:43:56,170
Let's not risk ourselves
to protect others!

847
01:43:56,911 --> 01:43:58,708
Come!

848
01:43:58,879 --> 01:44:00,676
Let's protect our own homes!

849
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:03,908
Stop!

850
01:44:07,555 --> 01:44:11,286
Pick up your spears!
Go back to your line

851
01:44:48,295 --> 01:44:50,695
Where is Yohei?
That blasted fool!

852
01:44:57,338 --> 01:44:58,999
You fool!

853
01:45:17,758 --> 01:45:19,817
The outlying houses are three

854
01:45:20,794 --> 01:45:22,489
The village has twenty

855
01:45:23,297 --> 01:45:26,960
We can't endanger
twenty for three!

856
01:45:28,569 --> 01:45:32,665
No outlying house can be saved

857
01:45:33,674 --> 01:45:35,437
while the village proper
is destroyed!

858
01:45:40,147 --> 01:45:41,375
Remember!

859
01:45:41,915 --> 01:45:43,212
That's war!

860
01:45:45,052 --> 01:45:47,282
You're all in one boat!

861
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:54,250
He who thinks only about himself
will destroy himself, too!

862
01:45:58,132 --> 01:46:01,568
Such selfishness
will not be tolerated!

863
01:46:28,629 --> 01:46:35,762
INTERMISSION

864
01:52:30,791 --> 01:52:32,952
Sheeyit! Who would
have suspected

865
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:34,684
So many women lived here!

866
01:52:42,102 --> 01:52:44,297
Where were you hiding these girls?

867
01:52:58,885 --> 01:53:00,512
Give me your sickle!

868
01:53:02,255 --> 01:53:04,314
I'll cut a lot for you

869
01:53:04,791 --> 01:53:07,385
So let's be good friends, eh?

870
01:53:32,018 --> 01:53:32,985
Rikichi!

871
01:53:34,721 --> 01:53:37,815
I see that the married couples
are the most efficient

872
01:53:38,658 --> 01:53:40,558
I'd wish you'd marry soon

873
01:53:44,164 --> 01:53:46,325
Why are you angry?

874
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:48,224
I only...

875
01:53:49,436 --> 01:53:51,768
Katsushiro, bring him back!

876
01:53:52,472 --> 01:53:54,099
Why did he run away?

877
01:54:03,550 --> 01:54:04,812
Shino, stop dreaming!

878
01:54:22,135 --> 01:54:24,603
What is this?
A bear's lair?

879
01:54:27,507 --> 01:54:29,338
It's been sickled

880
01:54:32,279 --> 01:54:33,371
Rikichi, eh?

881
01:54:34,548 --> 01:54:36,038
I didn't witness it

882
01:54:36,349 --> 01:54:40,251
I was looking for him,
when he came out

883
01:54:40,687 --> 01:54:43,554
His face was strained and sweaty

884
01:54:47,694 --> 01:54:49,093
What did you say to him?

885
01:54:49,329 --> 01:54:52,628
Nothing.
I only suggested that he marry

886
01:54:56,236 --> 01:55:00,036
Something pretty painful
must be eating him

887
01:55:00,907 --> 01:55:02,670
His face tells me that

888
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:09,109
His lips are tightly set,
like bolted door

889
01:55:09,849 --> 01:55:11,612
Try to open them

890
01:55:19,626 --> 01:55:20,854
Who's there?

891
01:55:21,061 --> 01:55:22,187
It's me!

892
01:55:24,264 --> 01:55:26,596
Is everything all right?

893
01:55:34,107 --> 01:55:35,734
Won't you sit down?

894
01:55:36,376 --> 01:55:37,900
Let's talk

895
01:55:43,550 --> 01:55:49,113
Often, just talking
soothes one's mind

896
01:55:49,889 --> 01:55:53,723
Speaking about a suffering
eases it away

897
01:55:57,330 --> 01:56:00,458
Incidentally, you're
a man of few words

898
01:56:01,534 --> 01:56:05,026
But, if you have something
bottled up inside you,

899
01:56:05,205 --> 01:56:06,331
better let it out

900
01:56:09,109 --> 01:56:12,875
And I believe this is
a good chance to do it

901
01:56:14,681 --> 01:56:16,649
I've nothing bottled up

902
01:56:35,435 --> 01:56:36,595
Let's go out

903
01:56:39,472 --> 01:56:42,100
Don't wake him.
He's a child

904
01:56:51,084 --> 01:56:52,915
He said "Shino."

905
01:56:53,486 --> 01:56:54,953
Shino is...

906
01:56:56,156 --> 01:56:58,124
A woman's name

907
01:56:58,425 --> 01:57:01,223
Certainly doesn't sound
like a child dreaming

908
01:57:07,367 --> 01:57:09,232
Where shall we begin?

909
01:57:09,869 --> 01:57:12,064
First, the weakest

910
01:58:10,697 --> 01:58:11,823
Who's there?

911
01:58:18,838 --> 01:58:19,998
Who's there?

912
01:58:21,107 --> 01:58:22,335
Come out!

913
01:58:23,209 --> 01:58:24,540
Who's there?

914
01:58:24,744 --> 01:58:25,733
Kikuchiyo!

915
01:58:28,515 --> 01:58:29,982
You're lucky!

916
01:58:30,884 --> 01:58:33,284
Had it been the bandits,
your neck...

917
01:59:06,486 --> 01:59:07,578
Yohei!

918
01:59:09,055 --> 01:59:10,181
What is this?

919
01:59:11,391 --> 01:59:12,915
My horse, sir

920
01:59:15,862 --> 01:59:17,955
I thought it was a fat mouse

921
01:59:58,805 --> 02:00:06,837
Sparrow singing, crows crowing

922
02:00:11,351 --> 02:00:13,911
What's the matter?
Aren't the bandits coming?

923
02:00:16,890 --> 02:00:19,222
If they don't come, what a loss!

924
02:00:20,260 --> 02:00:22,285
Hiring those greedy samurai!

925
02:00:22,495 --> 02:00:25,259
- Fool!
- Bandits better not come at all!

926
02:00:34,974 --> 02:00:38,171
What are you going to do
with this old horse?

927
02:00:41,781 --> 02:00:44,648
Stop it! If you cripple it,
Yohei will cry!

928
02:00:45,084 --> 02:00:47,712
What are you talking about?
I'm a good rider!

929
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:01,198
He's doing all right!

930
02:01:17,383 --> 02:01:18,680
That looks good!

931
02:01:43,343 --> 02:01:44,571
They're merry

932
02:01:46,946 --> 02:01:49,437
The thrashing is finished
and no sign of bandits

933
02:01:50,049 --> 02:01:52,882
They're beginning to think
none are coming

934
02:01:53,886 --> 02:01:56,081
Wishful thinking

935
02:01:57,724 --> 02:02:01,922
Danger strikes when
everything looks so safe

936
02:02:03,997 --> 02:02:06,192
Tell them to take up their posts!

937
02:02:40,133 --> 02:02:43,068
I wish I were a samurai's daughter

938
02:02:47,106 --> 02:02:49,097
A farmer's life is wretched

939
02:02:50,109 --> 02:02:53,272
I'm too fortunate. I'm shamed

940
02:02:53,546 --> 02:02:55,138
Oh, I don't mean that

941
02:02:55,815 --> 02:02:58,545
You're samurai and I'm a peasant

942
02:02:59,152 --> 02:03:00,050
I never...

943
02:03:00,186 --> 02:03:02,916
Oh, I don't mind that!

944
02:03:03,089 --> 02:03:06,547
I'm not worrying about the future!

945
02:03:41,027 --> 02:03:42,119
You chicken!

946
02:03:42,328 --> 02:03:43,056
Aren't you samurai?

947
02:04:51,464 --> 02:04:53,898
Three strangers near
the west road, sir

948
02:04:56,402 --> 02:04:59,667
- No one else knows about this.
- Not yet

949
02:04:59,839 --> 02:05:00,897
Let's keep quiet

950
02:05:03,976 --> 02:05:06,843
I saw three horses on the hill!

951
02:05:07,013 --> 02:05:08,173
The bandits!

952
02:05:08,581 --> 02:05:09,809
I know

953
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:16,488
- They're here!
- How do you know?

954
02:05:16,989 --> 02:05:19,685
It's evident. This commotion

955
02:05:23,696 --> 02:05:26,062
From which direction?
The hills or the west?

956
02:05:28,601 --> 02:05:29,693
The west

957
02:05:38,778 --> 02:05:39,767
The bandits are coming!

958
02:05:44,116 --> 02:05:45,447
Tell them to stay inside

959
02:05:45,852 --> 02:05:47,285
It's only three bandits

960
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:49,285
Keep them quiet

961
02:05:50,590 --> 02:05:52,353
They must be scouts

962
02:05:52,825 --> 02:05:54,156
They must not see us

963
02:06:12,545 --> 02:06:13,773
What's up?

964
02:06:19,352 --> 02:06:20,410
The bandits?

965
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:22,485
They've come?

966
02:06:33,933 --> 02:06:34,900
Quiet!

967
02:06:37,003 --> 02:06:37,992
Where?

968
02:06:39,171 --> 02:06:40,638
That tree...!

969
02:06:56,155 --> 02:06:58,020
Scouts, undoubtedly

970
02:06:59,292 --> 02:07:00,816
They're surprised to see the fence

971
02:07:02,228 --> 02:07:04,753
They don't know about us

972
02:07:04,964 --> 02:07:06,625
I hope you're right

973
02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:12,460
Where is everybody?

974
02:07:12,638 --> 02:07:13,764
What a fool!

975
02:07:15,041 --> 02:07:16,269
Kikuchiyo!

976
02:07:23,082 --> 02:07:24,481
Have they come?

977
02:07:24,650 --> 02:07:25,446
Is that right?

978
02:07:28,788 --> 02:07:30,119
Now they've seen us!

979
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:44,064
Now that they know,
they mustn't leave

980
02:07:45,738 --> 02:07:47,968
I'll kill them.
They're in my territory

981
02:07:49,208 --> 02:07:50,470
I didn't know...

982
02:07:50,643 --> 02:07:54,044
Go. Catch one of them
to make amends

983
02:07:54,347 --> 02:07:56,076
Take a short cut

984
02:07:56,315 --> 02:07:58,044
Yes, to the horses

985
02:07:59,986 --> 02:08:01,180
Katsushiro!

986
02:08:02,521 --> 02:08:03,579
You just watch! Understand?

987
02:08:12,131 --> 02:08:13,792
Gee! Good horses!

988
02:08:18,804 --> 02:08:20,533
You lie here

989
02:08:29,782 --> 02:08:31,545
- What are you going to do?
- Me?

990
02:10:33,105 --> 02:10:35,630
Katsushiro! It's all over now

991
02:10:36,275 --> 02:10:37,537
Come out

992
02:11:02,668 --> 02:11:06,160
Wait! This is a prisoner of war!

993
02:11:08,174 --> 02:11:12,770
He's begging for mercy!
We mustn't kill him

994
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:15,842
We don't need your help!

995
02:11:38,237 --> 02:11:41,798
Let her avenge her son's death!

996
02:11:45,010 --> 02:11:46,341
Somebody!

997
02:11:46,645 --> 02:11:48,112
Assist her!

998
02:11:58,791 --> 02:12:01,419
According to that bandit,
their fort must be pretty...

999
02:12:01,627 --> 02:12:04,061
- Flimsy!
- Must be as full of holes

1000
02:12:04,230 --> 02:12:06,198
as Yohei's trousers!

1001
02:12:06,398 --> 02:12:08,263
If it's that approachable

1002
02:12:08,434 --> 02:12:10,664
- Let's attack.
- They are forty

1003
02:12:10,836 --> 02:12:12,929
We must decrease them

1004
02:12:13,339 --> 02:12:15,603
if we can do it
without losing anybody

1005
02:12:15,841 --> 02:12:18,002
We couldn't afford a loss

1006
02:12:18,210 --> 02:12:20,178
Any battle is a gamble

1007
02:12:20,346 --> 02:12:22,473
Three can kill at least ten

1008
02:12:24,016 --> 02:12:28,009
Is that place very far from here?

1009
02:12:28,721 --> 02:12:30,086
A day's walk

1010
02:12:30,923 --> 02:12:33,187
But we have horses now!

1011
02:12:33,559 --> 02:12:35,026
Then half a day

1012
02:12:47,940 --> 02:12:49,100
All right!

1013
02:12:50,175 --> 02:12:52,769
If we leave now,
we'll get there by dawn

1014
02:12:52,945 --> 02:12:54,276
But who?

1015
02:12:57,816 --> 02:12:58,646
Not you!

1016
02:13:01,787 --> 02:13:03,345
I go! It's decided!

1017
02:13:04,823 --> 02:13:06,688
Me too!
I'll be the guide!

1018
02:13:07,226 --> 02:13:09,717
- Not enough horses!
- Yes, we have

1019
02:13:10,529 --> 02:13:13,965
You ride Yohei's horse.
Nobody else can!

1020
02:13:36,855 --> 02:13:39,187
You fool! This way! Damn you!

1021
02:13:40,793 --> 02:13:43,261
You call yourself a horse!
For shame!

1022
02:13:47,633 --> 02:13:48,600
Hey! Wait!

1023
02:13:50,669 --> 02:13:51,499
Please!

1024
02:13:52,204 --> 02:13:52,761
I apologize!

1025
02:13:53,939 --> 02:13:56,134
Forgive me!

1026
02:15:23,929 --> 02:15:25,123
Set fire to all the huts!

1027
02:15:25,397 --> 02:15:26,694
And we'll kill them
as they come out!

1028
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:03,585
Looking good, fool! Damn!

1029
02:18:04,256 --> 02:18:05,245
Good work!

1030
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:23,235
Rikichi! Look out! Rikichi!

1031
02:18:30,182 --> 02:18:31,581
Come back, Rikichi!

1032
02:19:16,261 --> 02:19:17,694
Fool! What're you doing?

1033
02:19:32,411 --> 02:19:34,402
You fool!

1034
02:19:34,980 --> 02:19:36,277
It's your fault!

1035
02:19:36,481 --> 02:19:37,948
Who was she?

1036
02:19:39,484 --> 02:19:40,473
My wife!

1037
02:19:44,723 --> 02:19:46,247
Heihachi!

1038
02:19:46,958 --> 02:19:48,255
Hang on!

1039
02:20:27,833 --> 02:20:33,931
We were counting on him to cheer us
when the situation became gloomy

1040
02:20:35,974 --> 02:20:37,965
And now he's gone!

1041
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:49,748
Don't cry!

1042
02:20:50,455 --> 02:20:52,320
Don't cry, fool!

1043
02:22:23,782 --> 02:22:25,374
At last they've come!

1044
02:23:38,290 --> 02:23:41,191
Don't forget! Three guns!

1045
02:24:08,453 --> 02:24:10,887
Twenty to the north,
fifteen to the south!

1046
02:24:11,056 --> 02:24:12,785
- Guns?
- All together three!

1047
02:24:13,992 --> 02:24:16,586
Go to the south.
Beware of their guns

1048
02:25:13,485 --> 02:25:15,350
To the rear! To the rear!

1049
02:25:31,403 --> 02:25:33,462
Twelve shifting to the east!

1050
02:25:33,638 --> 02:25:34,764
Thirteen!

1051
02:25:35,407 --> 02:25:36,806
An arrow got one!

1052
02:25:36,975 --> 02:25:38,875
Good old Gorobei!

1053
02:25:41,546 --> 02:25:44,481
Now go see if the bridge was cut

1054
02:25:44,682 --> 02:25:46,081
- And...
- The guns!

1055
02:25:55,560 --> 02:25:56,686
Go to the north

1056
02:25:57,395 --> 02:25:59,488
The decisive battle
will be fought there

1057
02:26:00,098 --> 02:26:03,033
Why didn't you build
a fence there?

1058
02:26:03,735 --> 02:26:05,828
A good fort needs a gap

1059
02:26:06,337 --> 02:26:07,861
The enemy must be lured in.
So we can attack them

1060
02:26:08,540 --> 02:26:09,871
If only defend, we lose the war

1061
02:26:22,253 --> 02:26:24,813
What's wrong with you!
Take these away!

1062
02:26:34,999 --> 02:26:37,797
Twelve are coming! Quick!
The bridge!

1063
02:26:37,969 --> 02:26:39,800
Are you blind?
That's what we're doing!

1064
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:44,670
And look out for their guns!

1065
02:26:45,009 --> 02:26:46,101
I know!

1066
02:26:53,718 --> 02:26:54,810
Hey! Stop!

1067
02:26:55,286 --> 02:26:56,947
I must find my dad!

1068
02:26:58,223 --> 02:26:59,884
He's in there!

1069
02:27:00,158 --> 02:27:02,353
He always wanted to die
in the Mill

1070
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:10,824
The stubborn dotard!

1071
02:27:11,136 --> 02:27:12,467
Go and get him!

1072
02:27:16,808 --> 02:27:18,366
Hey! Get away!

1073
02:27:19,811 --> 02:27:22,439
Be quick about it, fools!

1074
02:27:45,470 --> 02:27:47,495
On this hill,
twenty of the enemy

1075
02:27:47,906 --> 02:27:49,897
Twelve at the east

1076
02:28:07,792 --> 02:28:10,124
I don't like it. They're scared

1077
02:28:14,899 --> 02:28:15,866
Once again!

1078
02:28:17,936 --> 02:28:18,994
Once again!

1079
02:28:21,873 --> 02:28:25,274
That's Shichiroji!
Let us cheer, too!

1080
02:28:27,645 --> 02:28:28,373
Come out, all of you!

1081
02:28:34,452 --> 02:28:35,885
Now, yell!

1082
02:28:47,465 --> 02:28:49,023
I see!

1083
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:50,599
Let's out-yell them!

1084
02:28:54,005 --> 02:28:56,166
Yohei! What's wrong with your face!
Once again!

1085
02:29:08,019 --> 02:29:09,543
Here they come!

1086
02:30:04,842 --> 02:30:06,742
Hey! Get back! Get going!

1087
02:30:29,133 --> 02:30:31,761
Damn! Fool! Damn!

1088
02:31:17,515 --> 02:31:19,745
Forget those worthless shacks!

1089
02:31:22,887 --> 02:31:25,082
Back to your posts! All of you!

1090
02:31:40,805 --> 02:31:42,432
Damn! You wolves!

1091
02:31:43,574 --> 02:31:44,905
That's Grandad's house!

1092
02:31:47,845 --> 02:31:50,643
Where is he?
Where's the young couple?

1093
02:31:50,815 --> 02:31:52,612
And the child? God Damn!

1094
02:31:54,786 --> 02:31:55,753
What troublesome fools!

1095
02:31:57,255 --> 02:31:59,314
Wait! Don't leave your post!

1096
02:32:02,260 --> 02:32:03,420
Kikuchiyo! Come back!

1097
02:32:06,297 --> 02:32:07,423
Kikuchiyo!

1098
02:32:23,047 --> 02:32:24,878
Where are your men?

1099
02:32:35,827 --> 02:32:36,919
Speared!

1100
02:32:37,361 --> 02:32:38,521
What will power!

1101
02:32:45,236 --> 02:32:46,828
Hey! Kikuchiyo! Follow me!

1102
02:32:53,578 --> 02:32:54,704
What is it?

1103
02:32:59,116 --> 02:33:01,584
The same thing happened to me!

1104
02:33:02,286 --> 02:33:03,878
I was just like this baby!

1105
02:34:24,168 --> 02:34:25,192
Here I come

1106
02:34:40,217 --> 02:34:41,809
What were you staring at?

1107
02:35:47,918 --> 02:35:49,215
Everybody all right?

1108
02:35:49,987 --> 02:35:51,648
Well done!

1109
02:35:52,590 --> 02:35:53,784
Great!

1110
02:35:57,628 --> 02:35:59,755
I smell a gun fuse!
Run! Run!

1111
02:36:10,608 --> 02:36:11,666
Manzo!

1112
02:36:25,990 --> 02:36:27,252
Where are you hit?

1113
02:36:28,559 --> 02:36:29,787
Shino!

1114
02:36:30,461 --> 02:36:31,894
Bring her!

1115
02:36:32,296 --> 02:36:33,524
Don't!

1116
02:36:34,965 --> 02:36:37,661
A flea bite is bigger.
What are you screaming about?

1117
02:36:38,269 --> 02:36:44,538
It's foolish to reveal
your daughter!

1118
02:37:14,405 --> 02:37:16,430
Hey! Halt! That'll do!

1119
02:37:20,144 --> 02:37:21,441
Well done!

1120
02:37:23,447 --> 02:37:24,675
What's your name?

1121
02:37:26,917 --> 02:37:28,077
I'm Rikichi!

1122
02:37:44,235 --> 02:37:48,763
They attacked from three directions
and were beaten back

1123
02:37:49,907 --> 02:37:51,374
Next it will be here

1124
02:37:51,776 --> 02:37:54,040
It may not be tonight

1125
02:37:54,445 --> 02:37:56,242
But, they'll come

1126
02:37:59,350 --> 02:38:00,874
But it's awfully quiet out there

1127
02:38:14,365 --> 02:38:16,560
Right. However,

1128
02:38:16,834 --> 02:38:19,200
their main force is there

1129
02:38:19,470 --> 02:38:21,267
I'll show you

1130
02:39:05,115 --> 02:39:06,309
Good work!

1131
02:39:06,851 --> 02:39:09,615
Stick up that scarecrow

1132
02:39:44,655 --> 02:39:46,646
Probably in the morning,

1133
02:39:46,991 --> 02:39:49,482
they'll launch their attack here

1134
02:39:50,461 --> 02:39:52,759
We'll let them get in

1135
02:39:57,334 --> 02:39:58,961
Not all of them

1136
02:39:59,336 --> 02:40:01,099
Just one

1137
02:40:01,672 --> 02:40:03,139
Or two

1138
02:40:04,041 --> 02:40:07,977
As soon as they enter,
we shut the rest off

1139
02:40:08,779 --> 02:40:10,872
and trap them!

1140
02:40:12,216 --> 02:40:12,944
They'll be helpless

1141
02:40:16,654 --> 02:40:19,748
We'll decrease them one by one

1142
02:40:20,925 --> 02:40:22,586
What about their guns?

1143
02:40:23,227 --> 02:40:25,218
We must decrease them, also

1144
02:40:27,932 --> 02:40:29,399
I'll get one!

1145
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:30,862
I sure will!

1146
02:40:31,368 --> 02:40:33,268
No, you don't!

1147
02:40:33,437 --> 02:40:34,267
I'll go

1148
02:41:27,758 --> 02:41:29,225
I hear a footstep!

1149
02:41:30,060 --> 02:41:32,961
Katsushiro! That's O.K.
Rest a bit

1150
02:41:33,130 --> 02:41:35,530
Really I did! Listen!
Hear that?

1151
02:41:36,333 --> 02:41:38,267
Rest. I tell you!

1152
02:41:39,436 --> 02:41:41,529
You're tired!

1153
02:41:45,342 --> 02:41:46,400
Yes. I hear it

1154
02:42:15,239 --> 02:42:16,536
Killed two

1155
02:42:52,009 --> 02:42:53,374
What's the matter?

1156
02:42:56,146 --> 02:42:58,512
What is it? Hurry!

1157
02:42:58,749 --> 02:43:00,114
I need sleep

1158
02:43:01,518 --> 02:43:02,542
You are...

1159
02:43:03,520 --> 02:43:05,181
really great!

1160
02:43:09,426 --> 02:43:12,589
I've always wanted
to tell you that!

1161
02:43:39,623 --> 02:43:40,612
They coming?

1162
02:43:45,762 --> 02:43:47,320
We'll let one in!

1163
02:43:49,333 --> 02:43:51,528
We'll let one in!

1164
02:43:59,610 --> 02:44:03,205
Don't forget to close
the line at once!

1165
02:44:22,599 --> 02:44:24,123
Oh! They're coming!

1166
02:45:04,508 --> 02:45:05,475
Good!

1167
02:45:13,951 --> 02:45:16,385
What's wrong? Well done!

1168
02:45:17,421 --> 02:45:18,786
Deploy! They're coming!

1169
02:45:36,840 --> 02:45:38,774
Fall back! Fall back!

1170
02:45:43,580 --> 02:45:45,275
Let's go forward!

1171
02:45:53,290 --> 02:45:56,350
We'll let another one in!

1172
02:46:35,299 --> 02:46:36,732
Oh! Here they come!

1173
02:47:57,047 --> 02:47:58,139
This is fun!
Everyone look

1174
02:48:05,021 --> 02:48:07,080
What were you playing, dear?

1175
02:48:31,415 --> 02:48:32,905
They're getting wise

1176
02:48:43,193 --> 02:48:45,787
- They're mollycoddles!
- They're not so tough!

1177
02:48:53,170 --> 02:48:55,695
Four killed just now

1178
02:48:56,106 --> 02:48:58,006
Kyuro got two last night

1179
02:49:14,724 --> 02:49:16,487
He has real samurai spirit

1180
02:49:17,093 --> 02:49:19,186
He's fearless and skillful!

1181
02:49:19,930 --> 02:49:21,625
And also gentle!

1182
02:49:22,132 --> 02:49:24,965
So modest, even after
capturing that enemy gun!

1183
02:49:25,902 --> 02:49:30,430
When he left the hill, he looked
as if he were going to a picnic

1184
02:49:32,275 --> 02:49:35,938
You're amusing. Your jabbering
is sure interesting

1185
02:49:54,598 --> 02:49:55,826
Yohei!

1186
02:49:56,833 --> 02:49:58,095
Keep watch!

1187
02:50:02,706 --> 02:50:04,537
Don't make such a wry face

1188
02:50:05,242 --> 02:50:06,709
It's quite safe here!

1189
02:50:08,478 --> 02:50:10,036
A scarecrow could handle it!

1190
02:51:42,038 --> 02:51:43,164
Remember!

1191
02:51:44,374 --> 02:51:46,569
Every coward will
end up like that!

1192
02:53:22,872 --> 02:53:24,464
Everything all right?

1193
02:53:24,641 --> 02:53:25,869
They're plenty tough!

1194
02:53:26,443 --> 02:53:28,172
It'll be over soon

1195
02:53:28,978 --> 02:53:31,674
The thing is upside down!

1196
02:53:32,449 --> 02:53:33,643
We're all burnt out

1197
02:53:34,250 --> 02:53:35,717
And hungrier than farmers!

1198
02:53:37,287 --> 02:53:39,915
Don't complain!
Your misery will soon be over!

1199
02:53:40,623 --> 02:53:42,215
I'm depending on you, Brother!

1200
02:54:17,227 --> 02:54:18,558
I'll shoot you

1201
02:54:22,265 --> 02:54:24,062
It's me! It's me!

1202
02:54:32,208 --> 02:54:33,869
Great work, fools!
You wolves!

1203
02:54:35,612 --> 02:54:36,909
You fool!
Why did you leave your post?

1204
02:54:37,914 --> 02:54:40,644
Look at this!
I deserve praise!

1205
02:54:41,618 --> 02:54:42,880
The post is safe

1206
02:54:43,987 --> 02:54:45,921
Going on your own
merits no reward!

1207
02:54:47,724 --> 02:54:50,784
In war, it's teamwork that counts!

1208
02:55:02,205 --> 02:55:04,469
Gorobei, Kyouzo!
Guard this border! Understand?

1209
02:55:10,647 --> 02:55:12,080
Let no one through!

1210
02:56:29,259 --> 02:56:30,886
Fall back!

1211
02:57:15,505 --> 02:57:16,802
You! Hey! You!

1212
02:57:25,949 --> 02:57:27,746
Good God!
Two got through!

1213
02:57:28,184 --> 02:57:29,617
God Damn!

1214
02:57:43,566 --> 02:57:47,468
God Damn! God Damn!
God Damn!

1215
02:57:47,737 --> 02:57:49,204
Yohei! Where's Yohei?

1216
02:58:34,817 --> 02:58:36,876
I was watching!

1217
02:58:37,120 --> 02:58:39,145
Hang on! Yohei! Damn!

1218
02:59:23,066 --> 02:59:24,397
Shichirogi. Take over!

1219
02:59:36,579 --> 02:59:37,568
Gorobei!

1220
02:59:47,557 --> 02:59:48,649
Gorobei!

1221
03:00:42,011 --> 03:00:43,444
Thirteen left

1222
03:00:44,680 --> 03:00:48,980
But the last seven were costly!

1223
03:01:11,274 --> 03:01:12,969
Hey! Are you tired?

1224
03:01:15,611 --> 03:01:18,842
You look worn out, old man!

1225
03:01:23,786 --> 03:01:25,310
I'll go wash my face

1226
03:01:36,832 --> 03:01:38,993
The next clash will be
the showdown

1227
03:01:39,635 --> 03:01:43,230
If we must attack, let's do it
before we're too tired

1228
03:01:44,207 --> 03:01:47,335
When do you think
the enemy will come?

1229
03:01:49,078 --> 03:01:51,273
Well, they are tired too

1230
03:01:52,648 --> 03:01:55,481
Some are wounded.
It won't be tonight

1231
03:01:56,886 --> 03:01:59,514
But, they're hungry.
And we have reason to believe

1232
03:02:00,623 --> 03:02:04,024
there's dissension among them.
They must be desperate

1233
03:02:05,228 --> 03:02:10,097
Let's expect them to come in
the morning determined and desperate

1234
03:02:11,334 --> 03:02:12,198
Katsushiro!

1235
03:02:12,501 --> 03:02:14,230
Katsushiro!

1236
03:02:32,255 --> 03:02:35,156
The chief wants all men
to get some sleep

1237
03:02:35,458 --> 03:02:37,050
Two sentries will keep watch

1238
03:02:38,060 --> 03:02:41,496
Also, one by one, the men
may visit their families

1239
03:02:43,566 --> 03:02:45,193
The decisive battle at last, eh?

1240
03:02:47,303 --> 03:02:49,066
Yes. Please spread the word

1241
03:02:56,245 --> 03:02:59,009
You heard the order, didn't you?

1242
03:03:03,953 --> 03:03:05,477
I'll keep watch

1243
03:03:06,856 --> 03:03:08,551
You go to sleep

1244
03:03:09,792 --> 03:03:11,987
Now - Manzo!

1245
03:03:13,596 --> 03:03:15,496
Run back home

1246
03:03:16,165 --> 03:03:17,826
See your daughter

1247
03:03:19,335 --> 03:03:21,098
I mean - your son!

1248
03:03:30,680 --> 03:03:31,772
I told them

1249
03:03:32,481 --> 03:03:34,346
Good. Now rest

1250
03:03:41,624 --> 03:03:43,455
Tell me,
what was Kikuchiyo doing?

1251
03:03:44,427 --> 03:03:46,224
Still at the graves, sir

1252
03:05:01,270 --> 03:05:03,295
We'll die tomorrow!

1253
03:05:04,440 --> 03:05:06,465
We may not

1254
03:05:08,077 --> 03:05:10,375
But, probably we will die!

1255
03:05:32,601 --> 03:05:33,727
Shino!

1256
03:05:34,737 --> 03:05:36,261
Where are you, Shino?

1257
03:05:39,542 --> 03:05:40,668
Shino?

1258
03:05:42,178 --> 03:05:43,236
Where are you, Shino?

1259
03:06:18,147 --> 03:06:20,411
Sake, eh?
Where did you find this?

1260
03:06:35,998 --> 03:06:37,192
I see

1261
03:06:37,867 --> 03:06:39,095
It's just as Kikuchiyo said

1262
03:06:39,635 --> 03:06:41,000
They have lots of things

1263
03:06:51,614 --> 03:06:52,945
I'll take this, then

1264
03:06:56,986 --> 03:06:58,112
Shino!

1265
03:07:00,523 --> 03:07:01,717
Shino!

1266
03:07:24,513 --> 03:07:27,380
Here's some sake.
Drink and relax

1267
03:07:33,088 --> 03:07:34,555
This is not like you

1268
03:07:34,823 --> 03:07:36,518
Be bold and fight hard!

1269
03:08:44,426 --> 03:08:45,518
Shino!

1270
03:08:56,238 --> 03:08:57,637
You no good wench!

1271
03:09:14,490 --> 03:09:16,082
Don't be violent!

1272
03:09:16,458 --> 03:09:19,655
What do you mean,
falling for a samurai?

1273
03:09:58,200 --> 03:09:59,167
Manzo!

1274
03:10:00,536 --> 03:10:02,697
Is this your daughter?

1275
03:10:09,144 --> 03:10:10,441
Tell me!

1276
03:10:11,747 --> 03:10:14,807
You said she fell for a samurai.
What do you mean?

1277
03:10:17,219 --> 03:10:18,345
Manzo!

1278
03:10:29,798 --> 03:10:31,163
Speak up!

1279
03:10:31,567 --> 03:10:32,534
Tell us!

1280
03:11:05,801 --> 03:11:07,166
Are you Shino?

1281
03:11:26,622 --> 03:11:27,850
Manzo!

1282
03:11:28,657 --> 03:11:30,147
Don't be so angry!

1283
03:11:32,594 --> 03:11:34,994
When a man sees
Death in his path,

1284
03:11:35,164 --> 03:11:37,189
he feels the need
for a woman's arms,

1285
03:11:43,806 --> 03:11:46,070
just before a battle

1286
03:11:48,110 --> 03:11:50,408
It happens even in a castle!

1287
03:11:53,582 --> 03:11:56,608
Have some sympathy for youngsters!

1288
03:11:58,987 --> 03:12:00,352
I can't!

1289
03:12:01,190 --> 03:12:03,181
My daughter's been seduced!

1290
03:12:18,774 --> 03:12:20,298
But they love each other!

1291
03:12:20,909 --> 03:12:23,002
And she wasn't given to bandits!

1292
03:13:55,871 --> 03:13:57,395
Everybody's too nervous

1293
03:13:57,973 --> 03:13:59,270
Relax!

1294
03:14:08,283 --> 03:14:10,979
Everybody. At last
the decisive battle!

1295
03:14:14,323 --> 03:14:15,881
By the way, Katsushiro!

1296
03:14:16,391 --> 03:14:18,291
Fight bravely!

1297
03:14:20,429 --> 03:14:22,761
Now you're a full-fledged man!

1298
03:14:41,350 --> 03:14:42,374
Hey!

1299
03:14:45,954 --> 03:14:47,012
Hey!

1300
03:14:47,422 --> 03:14:48,821
Show some guts!

1301
03:14:51,059 --> 03:14:53,687
With those faces you won't win
this battle!

1302
03:15:07,976 --> 03:15:10,137
Kikuchiyo, what on earth
are you doing?

1303
03:15:10,412 --> 03:15:12,039
I can't kill a lot
with one sword!

1304
03:15:28,397 --> 03:15:29,830
Only thirteen left!

1305
03:15:31,466 --> 03:15:34,958
Let them all come in!

1306
03:15:37,072 --> 03:15:39,131
We'll immediately
close in on them

1307
03:15:39,941 --> 03:15:42,967
And trap them at the crossing!

1308
03:15:46,782 --> 03:15:50,047
This fight will decide
the outcome!

1309
03:16:21,216 --> 03:16:23,241
Here they come!

1310
03:16:45,841 --> 03:16:47,433
Here they come!

1311
03:17:14,336 --> 03:17:16,133
Shichirogi, Katsushiro West!

1312
03:17:16,304 --> 03:17:17,965
Kyouzo, Kikuchiyo East!

1313
03:18:58,640 --> 03:19:00,232
Katsushiro! Rikichi!

1314
03:19:00,742 --> 03:19:02,004
Katsushiro!

1315
03:19:02,711 --> 03:19:03,939
Go to the east!

1316
03:19:24,466 --> 03:19:25,433
Quiet!

1317
03:19:26,501 --> 03:19:27,763
Or you die!

1318
03:20:16,318 --> 03:20:17,546
Good. Well done!

1319
03:20:17,719 --> 03:20:19,448
I did it! I did it!

1320
03:20:19,587 --> 03:20:21,350
Stand up!
Go to the East!

1321
03:20:36,604 --> 03:20:38,504
Katsushiro... Stand up

1322
03:20:39,708 --> 03:20:41,073
Be careful

1323
03:20:41,443 --> 03:20:43,741
Damn you! Damn!

1324
03:20:46,081 --> 03:20:47,446
Kikuchiyo!

1325
03:21:36,498 --> 03:21:37,931
The bandits!

1326
03:21:38,099 --> 03:21:39,123
The bandits!

1327
03:21:39,401 --> 03:21:40,629
All dead!

1328
03:21:59,921 --> 03:22:01,786
Again, we've survived

1329
03:25:40,541 --> 03:25:44,272
Again we're defeated

1330
03:25:49,784 --> 03:25:51,445
The winners are those farmers

1331
03:25:53,321 --> 03:25:54,652
Not us

1332
03:26:24,485 --> 03:26:30,082
THE END
