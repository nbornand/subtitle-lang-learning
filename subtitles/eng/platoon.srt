Oh, man! Is that what I think it is?

All right, you cheese-dicks,
welcome to the Nam. Follow me.

00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,398
Get him up here.

Morehouse, drop back to slack!

13
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,638

Warren, you get out on flank.

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,391
Say, Hoffmeister!
Got a smoke?

17
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,830
- No, man, I don't!
- Sin loi, man.

18
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,075
Bravo Two-Six...

19
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,317
What's the delay up on point?
You having compass trouble again?

20
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,878
Come on, you...

21
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,315
Get a move on, boy!

22
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,469
Hey, boy, what ya waiting for?

23
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,114
He ain't gonna bite you.

24
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,312
That's a good gook. Good and dead.

25
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,828
252 actual. Move it out. Six says
we're jamming 'em up back there.

26
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,158
Tell that dipshit to get fucked!

27
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,670
Bravo, it's Two-Five.
We're moving out shortly. Out.

28
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
What the hell's the matter
with you, Taylor?

29
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,711
- You are one simple sonofabitch!
- I'm sorry, Sergeant.

30
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,515
Get that other cherry up here -
Gardner. And the doc.

31
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,551
Gardner! Doc! Up!

32
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,478
Gardner, Doc, to the front!

33
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,038
Gardner, get your ass up the hill,
you fat fuck!

34
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,116
Hurry up, bubble-butt!

35
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,230
You all right?

36
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,716
Ants. I got ants all over my neck.

37
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,118
You got some red ants.
Reds are killers.

38
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,629
Black ants are the worst.

39
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,115
Hurry up, lard-ass!

40
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,433
I'm so tired.

41
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,554
Just a little. Don't drink too much.

42
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,150
I don't want you drinking any more.
I don't want you cramping up.

43
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,593
You're humping too much stuff, troop.
You don't need half this shit.

44
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,954
I'll haul it for you, but next time
you check with me first, all right?

45
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,431
OK. Thanks, Sarge.

46
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,634
Are you OK?

Get that ammo off now!

52
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,236
Let's move it!

Damn, you dumb!

55
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,191
It don't make no difference.
She know what I mean.

56
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,278
She don't read too good nohow!

57
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,156
Look at this shit! Pork again!

58
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,149
Let me have that turkey loaf
for this pork shit. I can't eat this shit!

59
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,350
What you been smoking, Junior?

60
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,630
I hope you don't get that laundry gig.
I hope Manny get it,

61
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,354
cos your ass need to hump,
hump and hump!

62
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,110
Hey, white boy... what you waiting for?
That hole ain't gonna dig itself.

63
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,950
Come on, get your dick-skin on that thing!
Dig! You ain't got all day! Dig! Dig!

Third Battalion just got hit
15 kliks north of here.

84
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,069
Charlie had claymores in the trees,
blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces.

85
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,918
Bad shit.

86
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,759
Yeah. They got two lieutenants
and a captain.

87
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,672
All right, Sergeant,
who do you want on ambush?

88
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,075
Elias... you take your squad out.

89
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,155
Warren, you stay in, but I'll need
Tex and Junior from your squad.

90
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,556
- Roger that.
- OK, move out in two-zero mikes.

91
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,435
- I thought it was O'Neill's turn.
- No! Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

92
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,758
Fu Sheng's on an R and R tomorrow, and
you wanna send them out on an ambush?

93
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,030
You got the fresh meat, buddy.

94
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,438
They don't know shit, and chances are
we're gonna run into something.

95
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,198
What do you want me to do?

96
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,553
Send one of my guys to get zapped, so
some lame-ass can get his beauty sleep?

97
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,033
O'Neill...

98
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,073
Take a break! You don't have to
be a prick every day of your life!

99
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,397
Elias, get your men ready.

100
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,034
He's in three years and thinks
he's Jesus fucking Christ!

101
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,474
O'Neill, your short-timers stay in,
but you go out. I need veterans out there.

102
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,955
Sergeant Barnes.

103
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,712
I think, in front of the men,
it's necessary for me to give the orders.

104
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,591
Yes, sir.

105
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,237
Shit, looks like it's gonna rain.

106
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,318
It's gonna piss on us all night.

107
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,076
I'm gonna put a serious case of crotch-rot
on that ugly face of yours, Junior.

108
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,399
Goddamn, man! You break your ass for
the white man! No justice around here!

109
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,796
What's O'Neill got?
A nose up the lieutenant's ass already?

110
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,354
How come
we always get fucking ambush?

111
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,392
Cos it's politics, man, politics.

112
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,230
- Chris, show you a picture of Lucy Jean?
- No, you didn't.

113
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,352
She's the one for me all right,
that Lucy Jean.

114
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,996
- She's waiting for me.
- Real pretty. You're a lucky guy, Gardner.

115
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,270
Hey, you got a picture of your girl?

116
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,949
I guess that leaves some unlucky girl
back at home, don't it?

117
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,434
Tuck this in.

118
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,074
Shitcan this.

119
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,158
Don't need this. Turn around.

120
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,350
Come on.

121
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,711
Tex, you got Junior and Taylor here
on your position.

122
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,592
Goddamn it, Elias,
don't mess with my pig!

123
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,316
I ain't getting greased, so you keep
this sorry cheese-dick off my ass!

124
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,228
You got Taylor. Gardner, you're with me.

125
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,469
Look, case anything happens, you get lost
or separated, don't yell out, OK?

126
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,593
Just sit tight and we'll get to you.

127
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,595
Saddle up! Lock and load!

128
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,389
<i>Mom and Dad
didn't want me to come here.</i>

129
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:58,516
<i>They wanted me to be like them:
Respectable, hard-working, a family.</i>

130
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:04,556
<i>They drove me crazy with their goddamn
world, Grandma. You know Mom.</i>

131
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,589
<i>I've always been sheltered. I just wanna
be anonymous like everybody else,</i>

132
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,711
<i>do my share for my country.</i>

133
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,594
<i>Live up to what Grandpa did in the
first war, and Dad did in the second.</i>

134
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,234
<i>Well, here I am, anonymous,</i>

135
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,079
<i>with guys nobody really cares about.</i>

136
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,352
<i>Most come from the end of the line,
small towns you never heard of.</i>

137
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,552
<i>Pulaski, Tennessee.
Brandon, Mississippi.</i>

138
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,638
<i>Pork Bend, Utah.
Wampum, Pennsylvania.</i>

139
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,796
<i>Two years' high school's about it.</i>

140
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,596
<i>If they're lucky, a job waiting for them
back in a factory. Most have got nothing.</i>

141
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,711
<i>They're poor. They're the unwanted.</i>

142
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,515
<i>Yet they're fighting
for our society and our freedom.</i>

143
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,599
<i>It's weird, isn't it? At the bottom
of the barrel, and they know it.</i>

144
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,033
<i>Maybe that's why they're called "grunts",
cos a grunt can take it, can take anything.</i>

145
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,709
<i>They're the best I've ever seen,
Grandma. The heart and soul.</i>

146
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,633
Taylor...

147
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,955
Cheese-dick, you're up.

148
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,036
- What?
- You're up.

149
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,394
Sure you know how to work
the claymores, dude?

150
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,512
Flick the safety off
and bang on that sucker three times.

151
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,198
I got it.

152
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,310
Don't catch any Zs on me, buddy,
or I'll sling your sorry ass. You hear me?

153
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,035
<i>Maybe I've finally found it
way down here in the mud.</i>

154
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,355
<i>Maybe from here I can start up again.</i>

155
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,474
<i>Be something I can be proud of
without having to be a fake human being.</i>

156
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,833
<i>Maybe I can see something I don't yet
see, or learn something I don't yet know.</i>

157
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,032
<i>I miss you. I miss you very much.</i>

158
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,596
<i>Tell Mom I miss her, too. Chris.</i>

159
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,832
Junior.

160
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,430
- All right, motherfucker!
- It's your shift, man.

161
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,916
Here, take this.

162
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,556
Blow the fucking claymore!
Take the safety off, goddamn it!

163
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,471
Take the safety off!

164
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,958
Feed me, Junior!
Get over here and feed me!

165
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,873
My fucking arm!

166
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,239
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Easy, Tex! Easy, boy!

167
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,316
I can't even see!

168
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,670
- Doc, Gardner's hit!
- Right there!

169
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,551
I'm hit!

170
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,591
Taylor's hit!

171
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,390
- How bad is it?
- Dumb fuck didn't blow his claymore!

172
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,876
Relax, man, it's a scratch.
Hold this on here.

173
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,592
Don't lie to me, Doc. How bad is it?

174
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,632
He let 'em walk right up on us!
He was sleeping on his shift!

175
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,512
No, I did not.

176
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,838
Big Harold, keep an eye on him.
Don't let him go into shock.

177
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,155
Shut up! Shut up and take the pain!

178
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,236
Take the pain!

179
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,440
Hey, little guy... you're gonna be OK.
Don't worry.

180
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,030
Big Harold,

181
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,116
do you know if...

182
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,595
if you're gonna die?

183
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,960
Do you feel like everything's
just gonna be fine?

184
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,595
Don't gimme that morbid bullshit!
You're about to get outta here.

185
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,874
They're gonna give you three hot meals
a day... White sheets...

186
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,515
Them pretty white nurses'll give you
blow jobs if you pay 'em enough!

187
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,677
- I heard about them white bitches!
- Don't babytalk him!

188
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,349
The cocksucker fell asleep!
He let 'em walk up on us!

189
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,436
Just shut up, Junior.

190
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,158
You relax, OK, man?

191
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,076
It's not so bad...

192
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,956
Dying...

193
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,516
How long...

194
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,596
How long...

195
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,712
Come on, bird's on the way, man.
Hang in there. You're gonna make it!

196
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,675
Come on, Gardner, hang in there.

197
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,155
Come on...! Don't quit!

198
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,233
Come on, help me! Don't give up!

199
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,359
Y'all take a good look at this lump of shit.

200
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,358
Remember what it looks like.

201
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,873
You fuck up in a firefight and I goddamn
guarantee you a trip out of the bush,

202
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,956
in a body bag!

203
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,153
Out here, assholes, you keep
your shit wired tight at all times!

204
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,636
And that goes for you, shit-for-brains!

205
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,673
You don't sleep on no fucking ambush!

206
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,236
And the next sonofabitch I catch
copping Zs in the bush,

207
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,070
I'm personally gonna take
an interest in seeing him suffer.

208
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,156
I shit you not.

209
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,918
Doc... tag him and bag him!

210
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,397
I didn't fall asleep, Sergeant.

211
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,476
- It was Junior...
- Shut your face, chicken-shit!

212
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,352
You in big trouble, boy!

213
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,438
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor -
everybody got one.

214
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,516
Knock it off!

215
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,078
We got two men need attention here.

216
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,518
Police up your extra ammo and frags.
Don't leave nothing for the dinks.

217
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,993
Junior,

218
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,479
Tony,

219
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,556
carry Gardner.

220
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,599
The man would be alive if he had
a few more days to learn something.

221
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,439
- Hey, Taylor, what's in the breeze?
- Got light duty. Three days' worth.

222
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,757
No shit!
Too bad we're in base camp, anyway.

223
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,313
What you got? Beers?

224
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,353
Stole me some from the Top's supply.
Shit, he been stealing it from us.

225
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,436
- Are you back?
- Yeah, it looks like it.

226
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,358
King, where did you get those beers, boy?

227
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,916
- I found it.
- You're going on report, son.

228
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,476
Both of you, come with me.
I got a little job for you.

229
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,636
Motherfucker!

230
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,792
I'm too short for this shit, man!

231
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,311
They're always fucking with us...
no let-up!

232
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,830
Politics, man. Fucking politics.

233
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,557
That O'Neill, he's got his nose so far up
Top's ass, he's gotta be Pinocchio!

234
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:42,152
39 and a wake-up, a pause for the cause,
and I'm a gone motherfucker!

235
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,750
- Back to the world!
- Broke 100 the other day.

236
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,316
- No shit!
- 92 left to go. April 17.

237
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,236
DEROS, man. Home to California.

238
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,114
I'm gonna be sitting outside,
checking out the babes on the beach.

239
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,471
The surfing's gonna be good!

240
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,750
March, man, in Tennessee.

241
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,711
Sniff the pines... sniff that
cross-mounted pussy down by the river!

242
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,751
Hot damn!

243
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,998
Hey, Taylor, how long have you got left?
300 and what?

244
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,473
32.

245
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,156
332 days.

246
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,316
Sin loi, my boy!

247
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,228
I can't even remember
when I was 332, man!

248
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:30,833
You gotta, like, count backwards.
You got 40 days in. Think positive, dude.

249
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,396
Taylor, how the fuck
you get here, anyway?

250
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,159
- You look educated.
- I volunteered.

251
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,271
- You did what?
- I volunteered.

252
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,474
I dropped out of college, told 'em
I wanted the infantry, combat, Vietnam.

253
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,037
- You volunteered for this shit, man?
- Can you believe that?

254
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,870
You's a crazy fucker... giving up college.

255
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,958
Didn't make much sense.
I wasn't learning anything.

256
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,835
Why should just the poor kids go off to
war and the rich kids get away with it?

257
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,351
- What we got here is a crusader.
- Sounds like it.

258
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,676
You gotta be rich in the first place
to think like that.

259
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,755
Everybody know...

260
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:20,710
the poor always being fucked over
by the rich. Always have, always will.

261
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,396
You be cool, I introduce you round
to some of the heads.

262
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,433
- What are the heads?
- Later, man!

263
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,796
What's up, brother?

264
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,317
Your Highness has arrived!
Hey, what's happening?

265
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,399
I thought you was hanging ten
in Cambodia!

266
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,469
- What you doing here, Taylor?
- This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot.

267
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,149
This man here is Chris.
He been resurrected.

268
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,199
Go ahead, Taylor.

269
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,278
- What?
- Are you lame or something?

270
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,598
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

271
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,758
Your shit's in the wind, troop!

272
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,436
If you do that baa,
you'd better do it right.

273
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,596
You're weird, man.

274
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,039
You're a child, Lerner.
I don't waste time on you.

275
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,038
- First time?
- Yeah.

276
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,150
Then the worm has definitely turned
for you, man.

277
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,032
Feel good?

278
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,472
Yeah, it feels good.
I got no pain in my neck now.

279
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,558
Feeling good's good enough.

280
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,796
Put your mouth on this.

281
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,592
Where the hell is everybody, man?
They getting high, that's what.

282
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,269
Bunch of hopheads.
They think they're special!

283
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,756
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.

284
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,159
Redneck noise, dude, that's all it is.
Make about as much sense as you do.

285
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,511
All them chucks be rappin'
about how they losing their ho,

286
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,315
saying how they ain't got
no bread for beer.

287
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,798
Fuck that honky shit!
Gimme some Motown jams - dig it?

288
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,514
What are you talking shit for, man?

289
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,791
- Junior, you ever smoke any shit?
- That's right, dude!

290
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,276
Y'all be trying to keep the black man
down and string him out on that shit.

291
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,029
The time be's coming, my man,
when the black man throw that yoke off.

292
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,038
Simple - free your mind,
your ass will follow.

293
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,598
I can dig it, man. You smoke that shit,
everything kinda gets weird.

294
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,439
You hear that story about the gooks
putting chemicals in the grass?

295
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,074
So we don't fight, so we become pacifists.

296
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,953
Don't you worry, Bunny.
You's a killer anyway, man.

297
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,674
I still like a piece of pussy once in a while.

298
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,031
Ain't nothing like a piece of pussy,
'cept maybe the Indy 500.

299
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,994
Only way you'd get some pussy is if
a bitch dies and wills it to you and then...

300
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,553
maybe!

301
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,596
How's it going, Bunny?

302
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,153
LT,

303
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,236
check it out.

304
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,548
- Like that?
- Terrific. I'll send it home.

305
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,318
Hey, Junior.

306
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,398
- Lieutenant.
- Hello, sir.

307
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,474
Hey, Rodriguez,
that's quite a shrine you got there.

308
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,113
Thank you, sir.

309
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,151
You... need anything?

310
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,236
No, sir.

311
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,749
This guy's three, four times my size.

312
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,638
I got him in the O'Neill death grip.
He don't know whether to shit or go blind!

313
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,035
- Whaddaya say, LT?
- How ya doing, Red?

314
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,197
Not good. This cocksucker's got
every card in the deck.

315
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,437
- Full house.
- Look like you're doing all right!

316
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,120
Yeah, and I ain't even cheating yet.

317
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,676
Hey, Lieutenant,
some Kentucky windage?

318
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,756
Thanks, Sandy.

319
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,072
Play, Lieutenant?

320
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,556
Nah. Wouldn't wanna get raped
by you guys.

321
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,073
Why's that, Lieutenant?
What are you saving up to be? Jewish?

322
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,038
Jewish!

323
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,949
I gotta run. I'II, uh, catch you men later.
Enjoy yourselves tonight.

324
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,439
Well, that is one sorry-ass motherfucker.

325
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,876
What do you say there, Bob?
Guy like that make it? Yes or no?

326
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,070
That's precisely what I saw.

327
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,796
Sometimes I just look at a guy
and I know this fella's not gonna make it.

328
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,876
Just no fucking way.

329
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,636
Get it going now!

330
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,514
<i>New Year's Day, 1968.</i>

331
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,677
<i>Just another day. Staying alive.</i>

332
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,351
<i>There's been a lot of movement
near the Cambodian border.</i>

333
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,755
<i>A lot of little firefights, ambushes.</i>

334
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,910
<i>We drop bombs, then we walk through
the jungle like ghosts in a landscape.</i>

335
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,071
Bunker.

336
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,634
Where?

337
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,319
<i>Roger. Bunkers at point.
Two actuals on the way.</i>

338
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,078
Bravo Six, Bravo Two. Be advised
there is a bunker complex up front.

339
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,794
<i>We're on the way down. Over.</i>

340
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,156
See you next week!

341
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,753
Taylor, get your ass up on that flank -
about 50 metres.

342
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,599
Washington, you cover this side.

343
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,235
- Yes, sir.
- Get off your ass, Harold.

344
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,315
Bummer!

345
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:23,708
Christ, look at that, will ya? The teapot's
still boiling! They were just here!

346
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,469
Man, this is spooky, Sander.
Let's get outta here.

347
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,320
Watch it... watch it!

348
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,956
Look what we got, Sal.
We got maps,

349
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,116
we got...

350
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,674
This is gook stuff!
Let's get outta here!

351
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,759
No, Sal, this is important.

352
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,836
Come on, let's go!

353
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,510
Booby trap! Get down!

354
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,668
Medic!

355
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,030
Holy jeez!

356
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,196
Goddamn it!

357
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,074
We got two men down, sir.

358
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,159
There was an explosion.
Listen, we need help, sir, ASAP.

359
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,829
Move your ass outta here!
One round could get all you guys!

360
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,951
Rodriguez, Junior, let's go!

361
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,631
Lieutenant... tell Six we need engineers.
This pos is crawling with traps.

362
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,912
On their way. The NVA have been spotted
in the village half a klik down the river.

363
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,110
Six says we gotta get there ASAP.

364
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,756
Also, leave four of your men here,
and a medic, OK? Move it out.

365
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,278
Pull the flanks in! Let's move!

366
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,839
Hey, where's Manny?

367
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,713
Yo, Washington!

368
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,631
Manny, where you at?

369
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,716
<i>We had to get to the village
before dark,</i>

370
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,389
<i>so we left Elias with some men
to keep looking.</i>

371
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,351
<i>But it was King who found him,</i>

372
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,429
<i>about a thousand yards downriver,
not far from the village.</i>

373
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,558
<i>It was the end of the mystery.</i>

374
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,476
The motherfuckers!

375
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,233
<i>The village which had stood
for maybe 1,000 years</i>

376
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,273
<i>didn't know we were coming that day.
If they had, they would've run.</i>

377
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,669
<i>Barnes was at the eye of our rage
and, through him, our Captain Ahab.</i>

378
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,759
<i>He would set things right again.
That day we loved him.</i>

379
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,876
There he goes, Sarge!

380
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,277
- Check him out.
- Yeah, you got it, Sarge.

381
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,039
Tubbs, Ebenhock, let's go!

382
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,158
Get that stupid look off your face!

383
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,310
Hey, piggy, piggy! Hey, pig!

384
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,154
Bunny, clear the hooches now!

385
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,953
Spread out on the right!
Watch your back!

386
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,036
Let's go! Let's move 'em out!

387
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,312
- Move it!
- Come on, let's go!

388
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,275
Let's go, Junior! Bring 'em in!
Get those people down here!

389
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,832
Get outta there, you fuckheads! Move!

390
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,317
Come on!

391
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,198
Put 'em in the pig pen!

392
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,396
Give me your willie pete!

393
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,316
Fire in the hole!

394
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,151
Get 'em outta here!

395
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,271
Oh, fuck! We got one!

396
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,918
Get the fuck outta the hole!

397
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,600
Get the fuck outta there!
Come on, motherfucker!

398
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,950
Be cool. They're scared, man.

399
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,594
They're scared? What about me, man?

400
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,032
I'm sick of this fucking shit!
Come on, motherfucker! Move!

401
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,559
Watch this fucker!

402
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,629
Who the fuck do you think
they're fighting for? Got one more!

403
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,396
What have we here?

404
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,640
We got one, two, three, four mag 58
Czechoslovakian machine guns.

405
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,634
Barnes, they got enough rice here
to feed a whole fucking regiment.

406
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,352
Sergeant Warren,
you bring that honcho over here.

407
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,597
Tubbs, get outta there.
Junior, burn it.

408
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,997
What the fuck's the matter?
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

409
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,712
Look like I was gonna fucking hurt you?

410
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,435
Why didn't you listen to me? Why?
Why didn't you fucking listen to me?

411
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,791
Fucking stupid? You stupid asshole!

412
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,959
Get the fuck up here! Come here,
motherfucker! What are you smiling at?

413
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,431
Why the fuck didn't you listen to me?

414
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,834
Do 'em, man!

415
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,029
What are you smiling at?
You want something to smile at?

416
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,118
Dance, motherfucker!

417
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,071
Dance, one-legger!

418
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,998
Dance! One-legged motherfucker!

419
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,316
Come on. Let's go, man.

420
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,798
Fucking pussy, man!
He's laughing at you!

421
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,229
That's the way the gook laughs.

422
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,875
Yeah, sure you are!
You're real sorry, ain't ya?

423
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,152
You're just crying your little hearts out
about Sandy and Sal, and Manny!

424
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,033
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.

425
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,716
Whaddaya say?

426
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,351
Holy shit! Did you see
that fucking head come apart, man?

427
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,916
I never seen brains like that before, man!

428
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,312
I bet you the old bitch runs
the whole fucking show.

429
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,638
She probably cut Manny's throat.
Probably cut my balls off if she could.

430
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:17,436
We leave now, and nobody saw a fucking
thing! You understand me, Taylor?

431
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,870
Let's fucking do her!
Let's do this whole fucking village!

432
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,712
Look at the scars
on this gook honcho, Sarge.

433
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,796
Get out of here, Tubbs.

434
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,838
Where'd he get these wounds?

435
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,551
- Says he was hit in a bombing raid.
- He's a dink for sure!

436
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,758
Ask him why these weapons were here.

437
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,149
They had no choice. The NVA killed
the old honcho when he said no.

438
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,955
- All the rice is theirs.
- Bullshit, Lerner!

439
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,915
Who the hell was the gook
we nailed on the riverbank?

440
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:16,033
He doesn't know. He says NVA ain't
been around in a couple of months.

441
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,038
- Maybe it was a scout or something.
- Yeah, sure, a scout!

442
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:24,757
What about the fucking rice and
the weapons? Who are they for?

443
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,633
That cocksucker knows what I'm saying.

444
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,955
Goddamn right he does!

445
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,311
- He's lying through his teeth!
- Waste the fucker!

446
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,512
Where the hell's the VC?

447
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,678
He swears he doesn't know anything.
He hates the NVA, but...

448
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,155
What's the bitch saying?

449
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,669
She's going on about
why we killed the pigs.

450
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,678
They gotta make a living. All that shit.

451
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,111
Shut up!

452
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,753
Shut the fuck up!

453
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,993
You tell him, he starts talking
or I'm gonna waste more of 'em!

454
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,076
Tell him, Lerner!

455
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,798
Hey, Sarge! Let us in on this, all right?

456
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,553
Let's go for it!
Let's do the whole fucking village!

457
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,516
Come on!
What the fuck are we waiting for?

458
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,875
- Let's do 'em!
- Outta my way!

459
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,798
This is his daughter, right? Right?

460
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,229
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

461
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,589
Barnes!

462
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,031
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

463
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,797
Stay outta this, Elias.
This ain't your show.

464
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,276
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit!

465
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,278
Tear his fucking head off!

466
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,353
Break it up!

467
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,352
Break it up!

468
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,593
You're dead, Elias!
I swear to fucking God, you're dead!

469
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,030
You! You're gonna do time in LBJ!

470
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,720
This shit won't wash, you fucking puke!

471
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,479
Break it up! Shut up!

472
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,512
Break it up! Listen up!

473
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,108
Captain says to torch this place!

474
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,232
Torch this place!
Blow the weapons in place!

475
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,158
Round up all suspected VC
and shake it up!

476
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,192
- We ain't got much light left!
- Lieutenant...

477
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,710
- Why didn't you do something?
- What are you talking about?

478
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,195
You know what I'm talking about!

479
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:57,872
No, I don't. I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about, Elias!

480
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,713
All right, move it out! Let's go!

481
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,035
Taylor, let's go, for Christ's sake!

482
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,119
Move it out! Police up the weapons,
and let's go!

483
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,676
Fire in the hole!

484
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,956
Fire in the hole!

485
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,955
Hey, come on! Morehouse!

486
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,072
You fucker! Get outta here!
Get the fuck off!

487
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,636
Don't do it! Don't do it! You fucker!

488
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,716
What is this?

489
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,914
- What, you a homosexual, Taylor?
- Taylor, she's a fucking dink!

490
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,713
She's a fucking human being, man!

491
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,991
- Fuck you!
- You're a fucking cherry, Taylor!

492
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,669
Fucking animal!
All of you, you're fucking animals!

493
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,995
Fucking lame fuck!

494
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,509
You don't belong in Nam, man!
Ain't your place at all!

495
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,076
You don't fucking get it, do you, man?

496
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,919
You just don't fucking get it.

497
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,996
It's OK.

498
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,594
Get outta there!

499
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,834
Police up your dicks
and let's get outta here.

500
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,711
- I didn't see anything, sir.
- I did.

501
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,479
That dink was reported to me as NVA.

502
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,149
My report will include Lieutenant Wolfe
as being witness to the shooting.

503
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,589
All right, Elias.

504
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,234
Staff Sergeant Barnes.

505
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,318
I want a full report on this
when we get back to the CP.

506
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,399
You got it, and I can throw in
plenty of eyewitnesses if you want, sir.

507
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,875
Not now, goddamn it, not now!

508
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:57,519
We'll get into this when we get to camp.
If I find out there was an illegal killing,

509
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,631
there will be a court martial.

510
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,515
Right now I need every man in the field.
And you two will cease fire.

511
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,949
Staff Sergeant Barnes, Sergeant Elias...

512
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,032
You hear me?

513
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,438
We're back in that NVA bunker complex
tomorrow. This time from the east.

514
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,997
You people get some rest and be back
here at the CP at 1900 for a briefing.

515
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,112
Come on, man.

516
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,073
You think these chucks
give a fuck about us?

517
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,079
It could just as well have been you,
Harold, if you got in Barnes' way.

518
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,718
And that Bunny? That motherfucker's
crazy! I mean, he scares me, man.

519
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,635
He just scares me.

520
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,718
You bloods are getting
too hung up on all this shit.

521
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:49,356
These gooks are smarter than you think.
Barnes knows his shit, man.

522
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,995
They was NVA, every last one of 'em.

523
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:57,193
He's taken us this far, right?
He'll take us the rest of the way.

524
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,919
A Christian don't go around a village
cutting off heads and shit.

525
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:05,316
This shit is really getting outta hand, man.

526
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,318
You don't seem to know the difference,

527
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,079
the way you shoot up
that shit all the time.

528
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,752
I don't know, brothers,

529
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,509
but I'm hurting real bad inside.

530
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,876
Don't worry about it.
Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

531
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,072
- He's a troublemaker.
- Elias is a water-walker.

532
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:31,672
Like them politicians trying to fight this
war with one hand tied around their balls.

533
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:36,032
Ain't no need or time
for a courtroom out here.

534
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,594
- Sarge.
- Thanks, Bun.

535
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,395
How'd it go there, Bob?

536
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,399
Yeah, that-away, Sarge.
Fucking Elias, man.

537
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,511
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.

538
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,632
He's gonna get everybody in deep shit.

539
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,069
Somebody oughta frag his ass.

540
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,909
So whaddaya think, Bob?
Gonna be an investigation or what?

541
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,275
O'Neill, man, you worry too much.
Sarge'll take care of it.

542
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:16,916
- It's a beautiful night.
- Yeah. I love this place at night.

543
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,996
The stars...

544
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,437
There's no right or wrong in 'em.
They're just there.

545
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,518
That's a nice way of putting it.

546
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,789
Barnes has got it in for you, doesn't he?

547
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,071
Barnes believes in what he's doing.

548
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,555
And you? Do you believe?

549
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,995
In '65... yeah.

550
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,236
Now...

551
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,996
no.

552
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:00,193
What happened today
is just the beginning.

553
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,709
We're gonna lose this war.

554
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,353
Come on!

555
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,233
You really think so? Us?

556
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,074
We've been kicking other people's asses
for so long, it's time we got ours kicked.

557
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:28,632
<i>Day by day, I struggle to maintain
not only my strength, but my sanity.</i>

558
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,639
<i>It's all a blur. I have no energy to write.</i>

559
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,399
<i>I don't know what's right
and what's wrong any more.</i>

560
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,195
<i>The morale of the men is low.
There's civil war in the platoon.</i>

561
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,517
<i>Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes.</i>

562
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,633
<i>There's a lot of suspicion and hate.
I can't believe we're fighting each other</i>

563
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,389
<i>when we should be fighting them.</i>

564
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:55,275
<i>Counting days, and the six inches
in front of my face. Not much else.</i>

565
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:59,518
<i>Hope things are well, Grandma.
Tell Mom and Dad I...</i>

566
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,030
<i>Well... just tell them. Chris.</i>

567
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,231
Hey, big boy, I know you thought
you had that laundry gig all laid out.

568
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:31,909
I gotta paint myself white
just to get me one of them jobs!

569
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:35,828
I got my request in for a circumcision!
I'm gonna get my big ass outta here!

570
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,916
You gonna become a rabbi?

571
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,393
Leech.

572
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,355
All right!

573
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,436
Move it out!

574
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,189
Don't drink that, asshole.
You're gonna get malaria.

575
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,719
Yeah, I hope so!

576
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,796
Let's go!

577
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,195
Doc! Get up here! Lerner's hit!

578
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,439
Sergeant Warren's hit!

579
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:50,229
- What the fuck's going on?
- They got RPGs, man! It's an ambush!

580
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,749
- Who's on point?
- Lerner and Warren!

581
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,836
Taylor, where are you going?

582
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:01,434
Goddamn it, you assholes!
Get some firepower up there!

583
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,392
Watch out! Rockets!

584
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:25,791
- Where the fuck's Lerner?
- He's over there! By the log!

585
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:52,078
Fire mission! Grid 649402.

586
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,270
Direction, 610...

587
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,799
Adjust fire! Over!

588
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,677
Lieutenant, they're gonna get in
tight under the arty!

589
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,793
Let me get some men and roll up
that flank. I can work right up on them!

590
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:11,756
Get me Barnes! Elias, we got four down
up there! What do you want me to do?

591
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,237
Where the fuck is Red Platoon?
Tell those assholes to get up here!

592
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:20,956
- Elias, what the fuck are you...!
- Listen, Barnes, there's holes here.

593
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,957
Third Platoon's coming up here.
We're here.

594
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:27,392
Dinks get men in these holes,
they got us caught in the crossfire.

595
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:32,230
- Sounds pretty far out to me, Elias.
- I've seen it happen - la Drang in '66.

596
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,238
They cut us to fucking pieces!
I need three men!

597
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:39,956
- OK, you got 'em. Take off.
- Keep pouring off that cover fire.

598
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:43,755
I don't want to be stuck out there
with my ass hanging in the breeze!

599
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,599
Don't tell me how to run my war.

600
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,190
You go crying
to brigade on your own time!

601
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,278
Out here you belong to me! Now, move!

602
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,879
You're an asshole, Barnes!

603
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,310
Sir, get that asshole O'Neill up here!

604
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,908
Two Charlie, this is two! Be advised...!

605
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,996
Stay down!

606
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,956
Ammo!

607
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,913
Sarge! Short round!

608
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,796
Medic!

609
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,673
Satchel charge!

610
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,713
Doc!

611
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,716
Doc, help me out!

612
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:09,037
- Don't leave me, man.
- All right.

613
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:13,312
- Hey, Gator... you'll be OK, man.
- Don't leave me, man.

614
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,908
Gator, hang tough. You'll be OK.

615
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,876
Drop your rucks.

616
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,594
Taylor, you're coming with us.

617
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:25,429
- Please don't go! Don't!
- You're gonna be OK.

618
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,674
Doc! Take care of him, man.

619
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,474
Redleg! Redleg!
Ripper Bravo Two actual!

620
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,556
Adjustment follows!

621
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:43,273
You ignorant asshole! What the fuck
coordinates are you giving?

622
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,359
You wasted a lot of people up there
with your fucked-up fire mission!

623
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,436
You know that?

624
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,639
You know that? Ah, shit!

625
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,238
Redleg! Redleg! Ripper Bravo Two!

626
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,193
Check your fire! Check your fire!

627
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,556
They're coming.

628
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:19,077
Stagger yourself across this line.
Shoot anything that moves.

629
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,839
They'll be coming from over there.

630
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:25,953
Any one of 'em gets through,
we're truly fucked.

631
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,957
Where the hell are you going?

632
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,072
Down by the river, about 100 metres,

633
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,156
in case they try to flank us.

634
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:37,193
Third Platoon's coming up to our rear,
so watch for 'em.

635
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,754
Can I go with you?

636
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,633
No. I move faster alone.

637
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:52,358
Come here. Let's let arty
do a little bit of the work here.

638
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,278
You tell everybody to pull back
to the church.

639
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,915
We link up with Third Platoon.
You got that?

640
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,032
What about Elias?
If we pull back, he'll be cut off.

641
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:05,755
You just haul ass, too, Lieutenant!

642
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,916
I'll get him.

643
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,878
- I got two of them fuckers, man!
- I got one!

644
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,355
Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dicks!

645
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,033
Crawford!

646
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,555
Oh, man!

647
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:00,797
Kiss my ass, man!
I never thought I'd get hit!

648
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,515
It's a lung, babe.
You got two of them fuckers.

649
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,109
Where's Elias?

650
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,676
A bunch of gooks came through there.
We got three of 'em!

651
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,715
Did you hear the arty shift?
We're pulling back. Get back to church.

652
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,798
- Elias is still out there, Sarge!
- Taylor, I'll get him!

653
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,469
You get Crawford in. Now!
Before you Article 15 both your asses!

654
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,716
Move it!

655
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:18,877
- Come on, brother.
- Medic, where the fuck are you?

656
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,279
You're gonna be all right
in a minute, brother.

657
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,789
Taylor, where are you going?

658
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:37,869
Elias is dead. Fall back with the platoon.

659
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,514
- Get going.
- He's dead?

660
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,518
Yeah. He's back there about 100 metres.

661
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,471
You saw him? Where?

662
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,958
He's dead! There's gooks all over
the goddamn place! Get moving!

663
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,277
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Move it!

664
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,911
Let's go! Move it, move it!
OK, let's go!

665
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:10,357
You OK, Harold?
You're on the next one. You're OK, bud.

666
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,595
Oh, fuck!

667
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,360
- They've got Elias!
- What?

668
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,916
Back down! Back down there!

669
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:21,758
<i>Snake One-Nine, Fly Four.
There's still one of the men down there.</i>

670
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,750
<i>Hold your armour! Guns, pull up!</i>

671
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:48,838
<i>We're trying to cover it on my side.</i>

672
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:47,438
He killed him. I know that he killed him.
I saw his eyes when he came back in.

673
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:50,791
How do you know the dinks didn't
get him? You got no proof, man.

674
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:55,357
The proof's in the eyes, man. You were
there. I know what you were thinking.

675
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,391
I say we frag that fucker tonight!

676
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,193
I go with that. An eye for an eye.

677
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,596
I say let military justice do the job on him.

678
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:07,235
Fuck the military justice!
Are you joking me?

679
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:11,512
Who do you think they'll believe?
O'Neill? Bunny? Wolfe? Bullshit!

680
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:15,633
Shit, man, you try that, Barnes'll shove it
up your ass with a candle on it!

681
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,512
What do we do?

682
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:22,794
You all watch your own asses!
Barnes'll come down on all of 'em!

683
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:26,071
You gonna forget about Elias and all
the good times we done had in here?

684
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:30,113
You're trying to cure the headache
by cutting off the head.

685
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,789
Elias didn't ask you to fight
his battles for him.

686
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,629
And if there's a heaven -
and, God, I hope there is -

687
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:42,914
I know he's sitting up there drunk as
a fucking monkey, and smoking shit,

688
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,270
cos he done left his pains down here.

689
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,837
You're wrong, man! Any way you cut it,
Barnes is a fucking murderer!

690
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,678
Taylor...

691
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:56,237
I remember when you first came in here,
telling me how you admired the bastard!

692
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,634
I was wrong.

693
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:01,355
You ain't never been right...
about nothing!

694
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:04,836
And dig this, you assholes,
and dig it good!

695
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,838
Barnes has been shot seven times,
and he ain't dead!

696
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,633
Does that mean anything to you, huh?

697
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,479
Barnes ain't meant to die!

698
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,798
The only thing
that could kill Barnes... is Barnes.

699
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,876
Talking about killing?

700
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:35,109
You all experts?

701
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:38,198
You all know about killing?

702
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:41,637
I'd like to hear about it, potheads.

703
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:52,833
You smoking this shit
so as to escape from reality?

704
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,478
Me, I don't need this shit.

705
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,796
I am reality.

706
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:14,351
There's the way it ought to be,
and there's the way it is.

707
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,434
Elias was full of shit.

708
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,393
Elias was a crusader.

709
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,118
I got no fight with any man
who does what he's told,

710
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:32,119
but when he don't...
the machine breaks down.

711
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:36,199
And when the machine breaks down
we break down.

712
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:42,668
And I ain't gonna allow that
from any of you.

713
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,392
Not one.

714
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,400
You all love Elias.

715
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,960
You wanna kick ass.

716
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:18,354
Well, here I am, all by my lonesome.

717
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:24,674
And there ain't nobody gonna know.

718
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,591
Six of you boys against me.

719
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,830
Kill me.

720
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,720
I shit on all of you!

721
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,309
You motherfucker!

722
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:17,514
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man.

723
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,949
You'll go dinky dow in LBJ.

724
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:25,154
Ten years for killing an enlisted man.
Ten years climbing the fucking walls.

725
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,156
Don't do it!

726
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,516
Death?

727
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:52,269
What do you all know about death?

728
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,474
<i>They sent us back into the valley
the next day,</i>

729
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,479
<i>about 2000 metres from Cambodia,
into a battalion perimeter.</i>

730
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,592
<i>It felt like we were returning
to the scene of a crime.</i>

731
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:51,190
<i>Alpha Company had been hit hard
by a sizeable force</i>

732
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:53,993
<i>and Charlie Company
had been probed that night.</i>

733
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:56,918
<i>There were other battalions
in the valley,</i>

734
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,952
<i>but we knew we were gonna be
the bait to lure them out.</i>

735
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:04,631
<i>Somewhere out there
was the entire 141 st NVA Regiment.</i>

736
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:25,472
Caught those motherfuckers trying to
pull some shit on Charlie Company.

737
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,114
They found maps on 'em, man.

738
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:32,677
A friend at Battalion says they had
every fucking foxhole fixed on it.

739
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,110
Distances... tree lines... our claymores...

740
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:41,075
- Everything.
- This is bad, man. I got bad vibes here.

741
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,634
I also heard
we're in fucking Cambodia now.

742
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,433
Cambodia? Man, you kidding me!

743
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,994
You wanted to see me, sir?

744
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:53,750
Looks like you got Elias's squad now.

745
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:59,079
I didn't know we were still referring to
this platoon in terms of squads.

746
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,033
Take those two holes there and there.

747
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:06,312
You're tying it off with Barnes
up here, King down there.

748
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:11,878
My holes are far enough apart you could
run a regiment through and never see it!

749
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,911
I got five live bodies left, sir.

750
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:17,669
I don't wanna hear your problems.
You'll get new men any day.

751
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,872
- Make do like everybody else.
- I didn't ask for this job.

752
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,355
- I don't wanna hear it.
- You don't wanna hear it?

753
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:28,600
That's right. I don't wanna hear it cos, to
tell you the truth, I don't give a shit, OK?

754
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,553
I don't give a flying fuck any more.

755
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,318
I'm glad I ain't going with 'em.

756
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:46,035
Somewhere out there's the beast,
and he hungry tonight.

757
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,718
Fuckin' bummer!

758
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:53,550
Ten days and a wake-up
and I'm still dealing with this shit.

759
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,793
What's the matter with you, man?

760
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,150
How come you ain't writing nobody?

761
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:05,308
What about your folks? That grandma
you was telling me about?

762
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,836
Girl?

763
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:15,156
Got a mother and father, don't you?
There must be somebody.

764
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,838
Nah, there's nobody.

765
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,996
You been smoking too much
of this shit, troop.

766
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,197
Gotta control that - bring a man down.

767
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:31,030
I remember when you first come out here
to the bush. You was green as a...

768
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:35,597
Ever get caught in a mistake that
you just can't get out of, King?

769
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,075
There's a way out of anything, man.

770
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:41,112
Just keep your pecker hard
and your powder dry

771
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,879
and the worm will turn.

772
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,993
- How many days are you short?
- Nah, it's not just me.

773
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:54,193
It's the way the whole thing works.
People like Elias get wasted.

774
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:58,199
People like Barnes go on making up
the rules any way they want.

775
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:02,313
So what do we do?
Sit in the middle and suck on it.

776
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,908
We just don't add up to dry shit, King.

777
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,031
Whoever said we did, man?

778
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,879
All you got to do is make it outta here

779
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,835
and it's all gravy. Every day,
the rest of your life - gravy!

780
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,396
Oh, shit. Superlifer.

781
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,558
King, collect up your shit.
Your order's just come through.

782
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:27,878
- Don't fuck with me.
- What, you need a written invitation?

783
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,357
Cocksucker! Oh, wow!
The lifers have made a mistake!

784
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,232
They cut me some slack, Taylor!

785
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:38,319
Get your pig to Rodriguez. You got ten
minutes to make the last chopper out.

786
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:41,273
If you're not on it... I'm gonna be.

787
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,110
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

788
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:48,630
Great, King. I'm happy for you, man.
You take it on home for me, OK?

789
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:52,230
You got my address.
You know where to get hold of me.

790
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:56,592
I gotta di-di, man.
I don't wanna miss that chopper.

791
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,071
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

792
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,349
Take it easy.

793
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:06,278
Don't think too much,
and don't you be no fool.

794
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:10,359
Ain't no such thing as a coward
out here. It don't mean nothing.

795
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,436
My man!

796
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,549
I'll walk you out, man.

797
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,993
Take it easy, King.

798
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,510
I'll take it any way I can get it, brother!

799
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,638
I'm pretty fucked up.
No, don't touch this!

800
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,990
I gotta get on that chopper, man!

801
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:39,396
- So what's the problem?
- Says he can't walk.

802
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,476
Shit...!

803
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:44,395
Martin... get your boots on.

804
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,312
Next time I catch you spraying
'skeeter repellant on your fucking feet,

805
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:55,876
I'm gonna court-martial your nigger ass.

806
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,831
Then court-martial me, motherfucker!

807
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:01,191
Bust my ass!
Send me to fucking Long Binh!

808
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:05,916
Do your fucking worst! You white folks
have got your last klik outta Junior!

809
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:09,992
O'Neill, get me that centipede.

810
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:11,519
Sergeant?

811
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:17,715
That... long, hairy, red and black
bastard I found in the ammo crate.

812
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,150
- I'll put it in his crotch, see if he can walk.
- I remember now.

813
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:26,390
Hold up, man! You just hold up!
Wait, all right?

814
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:29,080
Fuck it, I'll walk!
I'll fucking walk, man!

815
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,873
Fucking pussy!
Sarge, I gotta have him in my hole?

816
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,513
Yeah.

817
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:37,076
Bob? I'd like to speak to you a minute.

818
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,352
I can't take it no more!

819
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:47,359
- I'd like to speak to you. Bob...
- Yeah, what is it?

820
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:50,517
Bob, I got Elias's R and R.
It's coming up in three days.

821
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:53,473
I was thinking about going
to Hawaii to see Patsy.

822
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,639
Bob, I never asked you
for a fucking thing.

823
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:02,436
I hoped you'd put me on that chopper
with King. Whaddaya say, chief-a-rooney?

824
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:06,872
I can't do that for you, Red. We need
every swinging dick in the field.

825
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,197
Talk to me! All I'm asking you for
is three fucking days here!

826
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,517
I am talking to you, Red,
and I'm telling you no.

827
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:16,313
- Get back in your foxhole!
- Bob...

828
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:19,671
I got a bad feeling on this one, all right?

829
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,519
I got a bad feeling.

830
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:25,074
I don't think I'm gonna make it outta here.

831
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,078
Do you understand what I'm saying?

832
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:32,239
Everybody gotta die sometime, Red.

833
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:56,274
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

834
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,598
There goes a fucking ambush.

835
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:14,474
They ain't even waiting till later.
It's fucking coming now, man.

836
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:17,273
Right fucking now.

837
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:25,399
You know, Junior,
some of the things we done, man,

838
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,239
I don't feel like we done
something wrong.

839
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:30,316
Sometimes, man,

840
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,554
I get this bad feeling.

841
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:39,029
I told the padre the truth. I like it here.

842
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:42,118
You get to do what you want.
Nobody fucks with you.

843
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,390
The only worry you got is dying.

844
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:49,230
If that happens, you won't know about
it anyway. So what the fuck, man?

845
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:53,035
Shit! I gotta be in this hole with you, man?

846
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:56,118
I know I shouldn't have come.

847
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:03,469
Don't you worry, Junior. You're hanging
with Audie Murphy here, my man!

848
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,275
Bravo Three, Bravo Six.
Send me a grid. Over.

849
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,994
<i>I can't, sir! We're pinned down!</i>

850
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:15,148
Calm down, son. I'll get you a fire
mission ASAP. Smoke'll be first.

851
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,396
<i>Lieutenant's dead, radio man's dead.</i>

852
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:22,469
<i>I don't know where the map is.
They're all around us - hundreds!</i>

853
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:27,674
OK, now spot that smoke and tell me
where to shift. Calm down, son.

854
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,553
We'll get you out.
Tell me where the rounds hit. Over.

855
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:53,270
Three Alpha Six, how about those rounds,
son? Can you adjust fire? Over.

856
01:32:55,040 --> 01:33:01,195
Three Alpha Six, if you can't talk, son,
just key your handset twice. Over.

857
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:14,709
Shit!

858
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,591
Trip flare - Rodriguez's hole!

859
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:05,995
RPG!

860
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,473
Doc!

861
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,830
- Taylor! Francis!
- Over here, man!

862
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:17,591
What the fuck's going on?
Rodriguez's hole just got nailed, man!

863
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:20,234
We got gooks in the fucking perimeter!

864
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:21,713
Shit, that's it!

865
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:27,432
Anything behind you don't identify
itself, fucking blow it away, OK?

866
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:31,189
Fuck! Two! Air strikes coming in -
they'll be laying snake and nape.

867
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:34,517
Don't get outta your fucking holes.
Stay right here.

868
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:44,990
They'll search this line all night
trying to get through.

869
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:49,352
All right, stay here, stay cool.
I'll be right back.

870
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,796
Who is it?

871
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,920
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

872
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:22,116
It's the ambush! Over here, man, hurry!

873
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:30,756
They're all over the place!
Hundreds of 'em - moving this way!

874
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:35,990
They wiped us out, man! We didn't
have a chance! Where's the CP?

875
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:38,395
- Back there!
- You guys get outta here!

876
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:42,115
They're right on my ass!
They ain't stopping for shit!

877
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,868
Taylor, man, let's di-di.

878
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,877
You go.

879
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,957
There!

880
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,516
No, hold it, hold it!

881
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,109
Out of the hole! Fast!

882
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:59,072
Get outta the fucking hole!
They're gonna blow it! Let's go!

883
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:03,352
Francis, move your fucking ass!
They're gonna...

884
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:24,558
- Follow me.
- What is it?

885
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,078
Die, you motherfuckers!

886
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:55,233
It's fucking beautiful!

887
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:08,316
Come on, motherfuckers!

888
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,350
Come on! You can do better than that!

889
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:17,439
They just keep coming, man!
Fuck this shit!

890
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,918
Get back here, you gutless shit!

891
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:21,275
- Get me Bravo!
- Charlie Company reports hand-to-hand.

892
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:22,719
Three holes down. They need help.

893
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:27,311
OK, get two squads from Alpha
down there! Go! Where's that air strike?

894
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:32,119
Where the fuck are you going?

895
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:54,273
- Can't you get anybody?!
- Negative contact! I can't raise Barnes!

896
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:55,958
- Nothing!
- Get me Six!

897
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,036
Bravo Six, Bravo Six!

898
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,672
Get him in!

899
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,156
They're coming through our line!

900
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:10,033
- Where's Barnes?
- Dead! I think they're all dead!

901
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:14,153
- Give it up, Doc! He's dead!
- Six, LT! Six!

902
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:17,078
Captain, we're pulling back! Over!

903
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:19,998
Where are you gonna pull back to?

904
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:22,111
They're all over the perimeter!

905
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:25,789
You will hold in place and you will fight!

906
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:28,718
That means you, Lieutenant!
Bravo Six out.

907
01:40:57,560 --> 01:41:00,120
Be advised,
we got zips in the wire down here.

908
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:02,959
<i>Roger your last, Bravo Six.
Can't run it any closer.</i>

909
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:06,834
<i>We're packing snake and nape,
but we're bingo on fuel.</i>

910
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:11,556
For the record, it's my call! Dump
everything you've got left on my pos!

911
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:16,117
I say again, expend all remaining
in my perimeter!

912
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:19,596
It's a lovely fucking war. Bravo Six out.

913
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:24,517
<i>Roger your last, Bravo Six.
We copy. It's your call.</i>

914
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:27,632
<i>Get 'em in their holes down there.
Hang tough, Bravo Six.</i>

915
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:31,036
<i>We are coming cocked for treetops.</i>

916
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:54,553
Barnes!

917
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,233
No...!

918
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,676
Get me a medic.

919
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,077
Go on, boy!

920
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:11,716
Do it.

921
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:45,389
Look out, Mad Dog!
We got live gooks at three o'clock!

922
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:48,353
What's down here? Let's go!

923
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:52,071
Come on, Elmo!
Move your flea-bitten ass!

924
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:59,073
Hey... you OK? You all right?

925
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:01,794
Can you walk?

926
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:05,037
Hey, Doc!
We need a medic up here!

927
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:09,039
- Come on, Elmo.
- Come on, Doc! We got wounded here!

928
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:29,830
That must've been some fucking fight.

929
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:32,599
You alone here, man?

930
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:33,675
Yeah.

931
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:37,274
Bunch of faggots all left me!

932
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:27,716
122 wounded and still counting.

933
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:31,037
Estimate 500 Victor Charlie KIA.

934
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:33,594
122 and still counting. Over.

935
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:41,789
Hey, Taylor!

936
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,710
- Hey, Francis.
- Hey, man, how you doing?

937
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:46,512
I'm OK. How are you doing?

938
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:48,631
Just fine, man! Hey, dig it!

939
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:51,399
We two-timers, man.
We gonna get outta here, boy!

940
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:55,229
I'm gonna see you in the hospital.
We gonna get high, high!

941
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,316
Sergeant O'Neill!

942
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:00,310
- How are you doing?
- Just fine, sir.

943
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:03,750
That's good, cos you got second platoon.

944
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:05,233
Yes, sir.

945
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,433
- Ready?
- You bet.

946
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:45,391
<i>I think now, looking back,</i>

947
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:49,399
<i>we did not fight the enemy,
we fought ourselves,</i>

948
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:52,353
<i>and the enemy... was in us.</i>

949
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:56,070
<i>The war is over for me now,</i>

950
01:49:56,200 --> 01:50:00,398
<i>but it will always be there,
for the rest of my days,</i>

951
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:02,636
<i>as I'm sure Elias will be,</i>

952
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:07,914
<i>fighting with Barnes for what Rhah
called possession of my soul.</i>

953
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:09,996
<i>There are times since</i>

954
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:14,272
<i>I've felt like the child
born of those two fathers.</i>

955
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:19,955
<i>But be that as it may,
those of us who did make it</i>

956
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:23,072
<i>have an obligation to build again,</i>

957
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:26,158
<i>to teach to others what we know,</i>

958
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:29,078
<i>and to try with what's left of our lives</i>

959
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:32,954
<i>to find a goodness,
and meaning, to this life.</i>
