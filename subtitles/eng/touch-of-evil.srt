2
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,030
You folks are American citizens?

3
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,477
I am, yes.
- Where were you born, Miss? - Mrs!

4
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,156
What? - Philadelphia.
- The name is Vargas.

5
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,596
Hey, Jim! See who's here?

6
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,753
Sure, Mr Vargas!
Hot on the trail of another dope ring?

7
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,152
Hot on the trail of a chocolate soda
for my wife. - Your wife?

8
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,312
Barely a bride, officer.

9
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,278
Can I get through?

10
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,593
So you cracked that Grandi business.
- We hear you caught the big boss!

11
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,231
Only one of them.
The Grandis are a big family.

12
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,029
No purchases, Mr Linnekar?
- Hey, I got this...

13
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,796
American citizen, Miss?
- I got this ticking noise...

14
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,034
No, really.
This ticking noise in my head!

15
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,150
Mike, this is the very first time
we've been together in my country!

16
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,633
And I haven't kissed you
in over an hour.

17
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,637
Mike, what happened?
- That car that passed us exploded!

18
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,715
How could it do that?
- I'll have to try to find out.

19
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,069
Better not come any closer.
We'll have to postpone that soda.

20
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,271
Mike, couldn't I...
- Susie, please be careful!

21
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,154
This could be very bad for us.
- For us?

22
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,712
For Mexico. Anyway, there's nothing
I can do over here. - So?

23
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,556
So I'll try not to be too long.
Go on, darling.

24
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,951
Wait at the hotel.

25
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,753
Blaine! I thought you were
in Washington. - I leave tomorrow.

26
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,038
You know Schwartz,
of the local D.A.'s office.

27
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,273
Who's in charge here?
- I can't even tell you what happened.

28
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,591
Why aren't you in Mexico City
for that dope trial?

29
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,549
Grandi? I hoped to go
on the morning plane, but now...

30
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,473
This business?
- Afraid so.

31
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,432
That bomb came from the Mexican side
of the border. - The car did.

32
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,040
He says
you don't understand what he wants.

33
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,352
I understand very well.
- He saved your life, lady.

34
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,716
Tell him I'm a married woman,

35
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,157
and that my husband
is a government official,

36
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,836
ready and willing
to knock out all his front teeth.

37
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,596
That's it, your husband.
- That's what he wants to talk about.

38
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,792
"Follow this boy at once. We have
something important for Mr Vargas. "

39
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,555
Well, what have I got to lose?

40
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,359
Don't answer that?

41
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,352
Lead on, Poncho!

42
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,354
Across the border again?

43
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,757
Hey Doc, here comes the D. A!

44
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,634
Where's Captain Quinlan?
- He's on his way.

45
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,477
Old Hank must be the only one
who didn't hear the explosion.

46
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,836
Terrible thing.
Has the daughter been told?

47
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,869
They're bringing her over now,
to identify her father's body.

48
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,958
An hour ago, Rudy Linnekar
had this town in his pocket.

49
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,316
Now you could
strain him through a sieve.

50
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,557
I guess that's my father.

51
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,430
Now Miss Linnekar,
can you identify the woman?

52
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,592
I'm not acquainted with my father's
girlfriends. - OK, Miss Linnekar.

53
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,111
Here comes Hank at last!

54
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,513
You've heard of Hank Quinlan, police
celebrity? - I'd like to meet him.

55
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,990
That's what you think!

56
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,872
Did they toss it in,
or was it planted ahead of time?

57
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,476
Who?
- Whoever did it, you jackass!

58
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,393
Hey lady, look at the pretty baby!

59
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,272
My nephew says
you called him "Poncho". Why?

60
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,754
Why you call him "Poncho"?
- Just for laughs.

61
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,073
This note says
you have something for my husband.

62
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,031
Señor Vargas, eh?
You know who I am?

63
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,114
Want me to guess?
- My name is Grandi.

64
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,115
You've heard the name before?

65
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,229
Aside from my husband's case,
isn't there a nightclub by that name?

66
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,997
Yeah. "Grandi's Rancho Grande".

67
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,389
My gun.

68
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,439
Kind of a joke.

69
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,953
Get it? - I can't say
it's the funniest thing I ever heard.

70
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,069
The name ain't Mexican.
I got a permit for this thing.

71
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,156
The Grandis been in Los Robles a long
time. Some in Mexico, some here.

72
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,473
Must be convenient for business.
- Yeah?

73
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,394
What business?
- Grandi business.

74
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,995
Yeah?
- Yeah!

75
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,518
You know what's wrong with you?
You've seen too many gangster movies.

76
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,879
Mike may spoil some of your fun.
- Mike? - My husband, yeah!

77
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,354
If you're trying to get me to call
him off, let me tell you something.

78
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,557
I may be scared, but he won't be.

79
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,556
You figure it was a bomb then, Hank?
- Or he was struck by lightning.

80
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,555
Where's the daughter?
- Marcia? She's waiting for you.

81
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,555
Let her go.
- You don't even want to question her?

82
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,190
Let her go, and put a tail on her.

83
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,553
Let's see if some Jane knew Linnekar.
- There was some strip-teaser.

84
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,839
What do you know? The D.A.,
in a monkey suit! - Well, it's...

85
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,152
You too! - We were all at the banquet.
- Political rally.

86
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,758
No, "Tootsie's Steakhouse".
- G-men, T-men...

87
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,109
Quite a little tea party,
all for Rudy Linnekar's bonfire.

88
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,150
I hear he even invited some Mexican.
- Vargas doesn't claim jurisdiction.

89
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:20,033
I hope not. 2 Americans are dynamited,
practically in my own police station.

90
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,954
What makes you sure it was dynamite?

91
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,035
My leg. - What?
- His game leg!

92
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,750
Sometimes he gets a twinge, like
some folks for a change of weather.

93
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,718
Intuition, he calls it.

94
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,829
Vargas thinks the murder took place
outside our jurisdiction.

95
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,232
Of course we're all
going to cooperate. - Oon't worry,

96
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,234
I'm merely what the United Nations
would call an observer.

97
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,270
Well, you don't talk like one.
Like a Mexican, I mean.

98
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,796
You won't have any trouble with me.

99
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,873
You bet your sweet life I won't.

100
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,237
Mike must be looking for me now,
and that's bound to mean trouble.

101
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,631
What's so funny about that?

102
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,639
He wants to know
if your husband is jealous, Señora.

103
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,156
You silly little pig!

104
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,439
Who are you talking about?
- About you! You ridiculous,

105
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,434
old-fashioned, lopsided little Caesar!

106
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,912
I didn't get that, Señora,
you'll have to talk slow.

107
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,357
I'm talking slow,
but in a minute I'll start to yell.

108
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,634
I wouldn't do that, Señora.

109
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,314
Just a little while ago,
this was a quiet, peaceful town!

110
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,359
And now this Vargas comes along...
- Mr Grandi...

111
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,996
You have something for my husband.
Isn't it time you gave it to me?

112
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,394
It's time he laid off my brother
in Mexico City! That's advice.

113
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,553
That's what I got for him.

114
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,188
Then the conference is over?

115
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,839
I'm free to leave?
- Free?

116
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,550
Nobody was holding you,
Mrs Vargas.

117
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,110
Nobody laid a hand on you.

118
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,558
You were just
paying us a little visit.

119
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,196
Goodbye, all.

120
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,434
Quinlan, we just can't cross over
into Mexico like this.

121
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,958
Thousands do every day. - Tourists...
- So, we're tourists.

122
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,909
Quinlan wants to check on
that girl with Linnekar in the car.

123
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,675
She was one of the strip-teasers,
I think I told you.

124
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,470
Pete told me before I left the ranch.
- That's right.

125
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,350
I told him I wanted to see
all the strip-teasers in the joint.

126
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,228
This is Mexican territory.
What can we do?

127
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,430
There's no law against visitors
asking questions, is there, Mr Vargas?

128
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,875
Where'd he go?

129
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,796
Susie, where were you?
- Mike, darling! - What happened?

130
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,715
Just wait till I tell you.
The craziest thing...

131
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,954
Who's the Jane? - His wife.
- What do you know?

132
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,920
She don't look Mexican, either.

133
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,920
The key to this whole thing
is the dynamite.

134
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,279
The killer didn't just want Linnekar
dead, but destroyed. Annihilated.

135
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,672
Over here, Vargas.
We're going in the back way.

136
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,077
Señor Vargas!

137
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,390
Señor Vargas!

138
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,874
Yes?

139
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,592
Anything wrong, Vargas?

140
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,798
No, I just couldn't catch him.

141
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,109
I hardly knew him.

142
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,149
Adair, come on. - Yes...
And I'm not finished with you yet.

143
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,120
Show's over. I'm going home.
- No, Ma'am.

144
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,069
We're gonna find out
nobody even knew the murdered girl.

145
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,075
Let's talk to this young lady.
- Cita? I didn't know her.

146
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,438
She joined the show a few days ago.

147
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,516
Wasting our time around here.
- I wouldn't say that. Good night.

148
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,075
What happened to Menzies and Vargas?
- They'll show up.

149
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,632
Pianola...
- Hey, we go this way!

150
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,998
Tanya still open for business?

151
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,233
I don't know what Quinlan
thinks she's got to do with it.

152
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,998
Maybe she'll cook chili for him,
or bring out the crystal ball.

153
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,476
We're closed.

154
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,035
You've been cooking at this hour?
- Just cleaning up.

155
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,955
Have you forgotten your old friend?

156
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,799
I told you we're closed.
- I'm Hank Quinlan.

157
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,590
I didn't recognize you.

158
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,639
You should lay off those candy bars.

159
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,237
It's either the candy or the hooch.

160
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,878
I wish it was your chili
I was gettin' fat on.

161
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,350
Anyway, you're sure lookin' good.

162
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,951
You're a mess, honey.
- Yeah...

163
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,955
That pianola brings back memories.

164
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,913
The customers go for it.
It's so old, it's new.

165
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,629
We got the television, too.

166
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,515
We run movies. What can I offer you?

167
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,309
You haven't heard anything
about that bomb, have you?

168
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,550
That was on your side of the border.
- You hear things at these places.

169
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,360
I heard the explosion.

170
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,672
When this case is over, I'll come
and sample some of your chili.

171
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,548
Be careful.
It may be too hot for you.

172
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,838
Hank! Looks like our friend Vargas
ran into some trouble. - Where?

173
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,357
In the alley behind the nightclub.
- Yeah?

174
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,837
Well, what happened to Vargas?

175
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,071
Nothing.
- Oh no? - Al!

176
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,870
It had nothing to do with the bombing.
- Somebody threw acid at him.

177
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,431
It doesn't matter. He missed.
- Who was it, Al?

178
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,549
I don't know. He got away.
- It was one of the Grandi kids.

179
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,350
What makes you so sure of that?
- Intuition.

180
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,949
Intuition? - Vargas and his
Keystone Cops have been giving

181
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,476
the Grandi family
quite a tough time lately.

182
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,872
Does your intuition
also tell you about my wife?

183
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,956
She was accosted and led to some dive
on your side of the border.

184
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,077
The Vargas family seems to be
gettin' into a lot of trouble tonight.

185
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,472
Can you describe this man?
- The first one...

186
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,758
...was young, good-looking...
- So there were two men?

187
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,990
Not exactly.

188
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,316
You say she was taken by force?

189
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,159
Not by force, no.
One of the Grandis was there waiting.

190
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,189
Short, fat, with a moustache...
- Uncle Joe. - What?

191
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,319
They call him Uncle Joe Grandi.
- That's right.

192
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,633
Go on.

193
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,152
I've told you what happened.
Aren't you gonna do something?

194
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,269
You have to make a charge.
Isn't that procedure in Mexico?

195
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,433
You say your wife was attacked.
- I didn't say that.

196
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,071
Molested? - Not physically, no.
- Was obscene language used?

197
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,395
I don't think so. - So your wife
allowed herself to be picked up...

198
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,553
She was not picked up.
- I think we're on the wrong tack.

199
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,758
Then this young man was her friend?
- Obviously not!

200
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,199
You wouldn't call that getting
picked up? - Now we mustn't forget

201
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,956
that Mr Vargas
is not on the witness stand.

202
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,512
Hank's a born lawyer, you know.
- No, lawyers only care about the law.

203
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,753
Captain, you are a policeman?

204
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,993
Aren't you?
You don't seem very fond of the job.

205
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,072
Plenty of soldiers don't like war.

206
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,230
It's a dirty job, enforcing the law.
But it's what we're supposed to do.

207
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,997
When a murderer's loose,
I'm supposed to catch him.

208
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,111
Well, Pete,
let's get back to civilization.

209
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,757
Let's go, Hank. It's almost dawn.
You gotta get some rest.

210
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:42,075
No chance of that, partner.
We got a big day ahead of us.

211
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,471
See any better this way?

212
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,916
You can turn it off now, buster,
you're wasting your batteries.

213
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,838
What are you doing in the dark?

214
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,631
There's no shade on the window.

215
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,475
Can we turn the light on now?

216
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,996
No, we can't.
- Why not?

217
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,960
'Cause there's no bulb any more.

218
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,475
Risto! Risto!

219
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,314
Uncle Joe is plenty mad.
He wants to talk to you!

220
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,791
Risto! Risto, come back here!

221
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,633
Stop him!

222
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,598
Stop him, Sam!

223
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,318
Who told you to throw acid at Vargas?

224
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,358
Stop him!

225
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,233
Who told you to throw acid at Vargas?

226
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,713
Who's the boss of this family?
Who's the boss?

227
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,749
My old man.
- Sure, but he's in the pen!

228
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,038
Until he gets out,
who's running this outfit?

229
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,352
Who's in charge?
- Alright, you.

230
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,917
What a setup to work with!
One brother in jail, two others dead.

231
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,676
Nobody left to do business with
but a bunch of nephews!

232
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,274
Don't do that!

233
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,752
You lost your rug, Uncle Joe.
You lost your rug!

234
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,033
This isn't the real Mexico,
you know that.

235
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,637
Border towns bring out
the worst in a country.

236
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,793
Imagine your mother's face
if she saw our honeymoon hotel!

237
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,189
Señor Vargas!

238
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,910
Does this mean you're taking
the early plane back to Mexico City?

239
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,038
It doesn't leave for another 2 hours.

240
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,315
All I can say is, if you are taking
that plane, I'm very glad.

241
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,678
I'm very glad you're very glad.

242
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,678
Who told you to start this funny stuff
with the acid? Who told you?

243
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,913
I just wanted to give his wife
something to think about.

244
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,596
She's gonna get plenty, don't worry.
- Here, you lost your rug. - What?

245
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,558
You lost your rug.

246
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,191
My old man's in no shape for the pen.
If they give him ten, he dies.

247
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,235
And if Vargas gets hurt, what happens?

248
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,519
My brother Vic's as good as convicted.
You leave Vargas to me.

249
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,876
Uncle Joe!
- What?

250
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,677
Sam, take it to her.

251
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,833
I don't want any more postcards.

252
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,310
I don't speak any Spanish. What do
you want? - I was to give this to you.

253
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,630
Susan... - Mike, look at...
- That was the police.

254
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,953
Quinlan has a lead. I must meet him.
Tell me what you want to do.

255
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,229
If you're going to Mexico City,
I can take you to the airport.

256
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,553
Perhaps that would be best. Just for
a few days. - I don't think so.

257
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,349
But a minute ago... - A minute ago
I said a lot of things.

258
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,878
Now I think the best thing
is to stick close to my husband. OK?

259
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:36,109
I'm coming with you. - But I must see
Quinlan at the U.S. Police station.

260
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,511
I'll wait at the motel.
- What motel?

261
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,753
There must be one
on the American side of the border.

262
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,593
"The American side of the border. "

263
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,310
I'll be safe there.
You won't have to worry about me.

264
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,474
Did I say the wrong thing again?

265
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,350
No, but it would be nice
for a man in my place

266
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,069
to be able to look after
his own wife in his own country.

267
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,112
If I go to the American motel,
it's just for comfort.

268
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,590
Not for safety.

269
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,829
Whatever you say, my dear.

270
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,673
...wealthy contractor
Rudolph Linnekar

271
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,277
has been identified
with a blonde nightclub dancer

272
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,118
killed in an explosion
a few yards this side of the border.

273
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,355
We'll get him where it really hurts.
Without laying a hand on him.

274
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,149
He's got a reputation!
He's got a young bride!

275
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:42,429
He's gonna leave this town
wishing they'd never been born!

276
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,913
But don't you see, darling,
if the bomb was planted in Mexico,

277
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,916
and the accused is Mexican, what an
international scandal this could be?

278
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,232
It might be kind of rough
on the tourist trade.

279
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,670
One of the longest borders on earth
is right here between our countries.

280
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,474
An open border, 1400 miles
without a single machine gun.

281
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,555
I suppose it all sounds
very corny to you.

282
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,552
I could love being corny,
if my husband would only cooperate.

283
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,629
Vargas? - Hello Schwartz. - Quinlan's
onto something new. Coming?

284
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,114
I have to drop my wife at a motel.
- Hank wants you with him. I'll do it.

285
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,909
No trouble at all, Ma'am.
- Won't you drive me?

286
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,313
I'll phone you. Which motel?
- The Mirador. - We better hurry.

287
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,918
Try to get some sleep, Susie.
- That Mirador's mighty hard to find,

288
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,357
with the new highway
branching off like that... Hey!

289
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,278
That's alright, I can find my way.
- His cane!

290
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,071
I forgot to give him his cane.
He really needs it for that game leg.

291
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,517
Did he tell you how he got it?
- What, his cane? - No, his bad leg!

292
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,878
Who are you talking about?
- Captain Quinlan!

293
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,359
He got it in a gunfight.

294
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,918
He was wounded stopping a bullet
that was meant for me.

295
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,118
But the bravest thing Hank ever did
was to give up drink.

296
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,193
He used to be a terrible lush.

297
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,309
But look at him now: No sleep,
still at it. Yeah, he never gives up!

298
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,509
What's wrong? - Why are you
following us? Get out of the car!

299
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:34,916
A man can't take a ride
in his own car? - Come on!

300
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,551
Wake up, Mrs Vargas.
We're here. This is it.

301
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,513
This can't be it. - It's all the motel
we got this side of town, Ma'am.

302
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,913
The others are all on the new highway,
mostly closed till the season starts.

303
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,118
Oh no!
- Oh yeah!

304
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,196
How long are you gonna
hold me here? I didn't do nothing.

305
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,194
Can you identify this man?
- Of course. That's Grandi!

306
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,195
I'm a member of the family, sure.
But nobody laid a hand on her!

307
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,716
Shut up. Get in the car.

308
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,755
What about my car?
- You can leave it here. - What, here?

309
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,038
In the middle of nowhere? - You're
coming with me! - On what charge?

310
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,954
I don't know yet.
That's for Quinlan to decide.

311
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,673
What was Grandi doing way out here?
- He was following us in his car.

312
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,232
Where are my bags? - We've already
put them by your cabin.

313
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,430
The last one, No. 7. - If you want
a change, just phone the desk.

314
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,550
Off season like this, I reckon
you're about the only one here.

315
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,476
I turned on the music for you
up at the office.

316
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,918
I turned the music up for you.

317
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,072
I thought you'd like it.
- Not just now.

318
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,909
It's past seven,
and I haven't been to bed yet.

319
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,032
You can get into it now.
I brought the sheets.

320
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,238
But if they think I'm gonna make it,
they got another thing comin'!

321
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,392
I'm not gonna be a party to...

322
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,596
I'm the night man.

323
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,434
It's day already.

324
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,995
I'm the night man. - Have the day man
help me make the bed.

325
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,834
There ain't no day man.

326
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,549
He was supposed to be here
at 6 this morning.

327
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,077
Now they phone and tell me
he ain't comin' at all.

328
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,278
They're sendin' a new man.

329
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,708
If they think I'm waitin' for him...
- Won't you help me make the bed?

330
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,635
Bed?

331
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,314
Wait a minute!

332
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,311
Your friend,

333
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,508
Mr Grandi...
He ain't gonna leave you here long.

334
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,309
He is not my friend.

335
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,792
He brought you here
in that car, didn't he?

336
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,033
No, he didn't.
In fact, he's under arrest.

337
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,759
Under arrest? Mr Grandi?

338
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,758
Yes, he is!

339
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,638
Hold back that second charge!
Stop that car!

340
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,474
Hold that car! Stop!

341
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,317
There was a complaint
about some stolen dynamite out here.

342
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,996
You fired anybody lately?
- I figured you'd ask about that.

343
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,278
A boy named Sanchez?
- Sure.

344
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,716
He's been playing around
with the boss's daughter.

345
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,510
I just recognized somebody.
- The one with the big ears?

346
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,198
We prosecuted him for voluntary
manslaughter. - That's Eddie Farnum.

347
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,390
Get out of here, we're gonna blast!
- How long've you been out?

348
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,439
3 months. - Quick parole.
- Who got you the job?

349
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,628
My lawyer, Howard Cranes.
- Grandi's lawyer.

350
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,952
Suspect now in custody.
- Well, this is it.

351
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,830
Suspect? Is that Sanchez, the one
you've been talking about?

352
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,835
They've located him, right?
- In Marcia Linnekar's apartment.

353
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,231
Stand still, we're gonna blast!

354
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,193
What's wrong, Farnum?
You short of dynamite?

355
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,718
Captain, have you anything definite
on Sanchez? - Not yet.

356
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,635
I'm goin' on my intuition.
- This car belongs to Howard Cranes.

357
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,237
You remember, that slick lawyer
that got Farnum a parole.

358
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,552
He was Rudy Linnekar's attorney, too.

359
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,197
Isn't that Quinlan?
- Quinlan?

360
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,036
I figured we'd have Quinlan
to deal with. You finished packing?

361
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,911
I've heard about that guy.
- Say nothing. Let's get your bag.

362
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,029
Remember: I'll do all the talking.

363
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,309
How do we begin? Nasty questions first
or the rubber hose right away?

364
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,039
Take it easy.

365
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,199
Vargas?

366
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,079
Yes, Captain?

367
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,151
I got my orders, Vargas.

368
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,839
I'm to show you courtesy, but that
don't mean you do the interrogating.

369
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,595
I know, Captain.
That's what I told Sanchez.

370
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,958
You're Ed Hansen?
- That's right, Captain.

371
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,229
Go and get me some coffee, Ed.
How about you, Miss Linnekar? Coffee?

372
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,959
No thanks.

373
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,629
I really need it. I'm an old man.

374
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,873
I go a whole night without sleep,
I feel it.

375
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,238
Of course,
it was a lot worse for you.

376
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:10,556
You've been livin' here
for some time, Marcia. How long?

377
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,473
Four months.
- Marcia!

378
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,919
You have a quarrel with your dad?
- I'm Miss Linnekar's attorney.

379
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,677
I'm Manolo Sanchez,
and I haven't got an attorney!

380
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,470
You two been sharing this apartment?
- I must explain.

381
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,668
My client is moving elsewhere.
- So she's been living with this man?

382
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,676
She'll be available for questions
later. I'll be present, of course.

383
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,390
Of course. Marcia, where was
your friend Sanchez last night?

384
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,759
Later, Captain. Later,
after she's rested. Come, my dear.

385
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,314
Casey, would you look in the desk?
See if there are some letters...

386
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,191
Unless you've already looked.
- We were waitin' for you.

387
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,590
I... I don't speak Mexican.

388
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,438
Let's keep it in English, Vargas.

389
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,958
Fine by me. He's just as unpleasant
in any language. - Unpleasant?

390
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,670
Strange, I've been told
I have a very winning personality.

391
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,275
The very best shoe clerk
the store ever had!

392
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,514
You weren't a shoe clerk on that
construction crew. Stick around.

393
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,990
I intend to.

394
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,994
Speak in English.
I don't like to repeat myself.

395
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,836
I merely asked him
if I could used the telephone.

396
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,878
Translation:
"The telephone is in the bedroom. "

397
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,350
That's all he said.

398
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,279
He also said he thinks
he's in for some sort of third degree.

399
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,399
I assured him
he had nothing to worry about.

400
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,270
Go in with Vargas. Maybe he don't know
how to use an American telephone.

401
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,955
I think I ran onto something.
Some love letters.

402
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,751
Go and read them in the bedroom.
I don't want to leave Vargas alone.

403
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,230
Save the good stuff for me.

404
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,519
Now, in English. - What do you
want to know? - Everything, boy.

405
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,354
Want me to call the motel, Vargas?
- Later.

406
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,833
...how did you meet Linnekar's
daughter? - Selling her shoes.

407
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,155
You took the construction job
to get your hands on some dynamite!

408
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,793
I'll only slap you if you get
hysterical again. Nothing brutal.

409
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,079
In the old days, we never hurt people
in the face. It marks them up.

410
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,675
We gave it to 'em like this!

411
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,958
Boy's getting a rough deal.
- He could even be innocent.

412
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,911
Intuition? - Why not? Quinlan doesn't
have a monopoly on hunches.

413
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,677
Who do you like for the killer?
- It's still early, but that ex-convict.

414
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,356
Out on that highway job? Farnum.
- Maybe.

415
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,788
Wait! Some dynamite was stolen.
- The crew's working for Linnekar.

416
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,479
Amigo, you're onto something.
- Quite an apartment for a shoe clerk.

417
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,668
Marcia pay for it? - What if she does?
- How long's this been going on?

418
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,150
Ever since her father
had me fired from my last job.

419
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,314
Naturally, he objected
to a Mexican show clerk as son-in-law,

420
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,837
so you had to put him
out of the way. - Naturally!

421
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,476
Just because he speaks gilded,
that don't make him innocent.

422
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,192
You can show motive, but don't you
need a bit more? - We'll get it.

423
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,158
There's my coffee.

424
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,950
Didn't you bring me
any doughnuts or sweet-rolls?

425
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,874
You'll have to put him
on the scene of the crime. - We will.

426
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,317
You need evidence.
- We'll get it.

427
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,349
You didn't ask me to get doughnuts.
- Where are you going?

428
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,469
This is not my case, Captain.
- What finally convinced you of that?

429
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,395
This isn't my country, that's all.
I'm not convinced.

430
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,950
Ain't that a shame...

431
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,035
Is there another phone near here?
- Right across the street.

432
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,313
Excuse me, Madam,
could I use your telephone please?

433
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,438
Right in front of you.

434
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,512
Do you have a phone book?

435
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,993
I'm blind. You'll have to ask
for information. - I'm sorry.

436
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,435
Hello. I'd like the number
of the Mirador Motel.

437
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,671
What is this place?
- Get going.

438
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,593
He didn't do anything.
- Go on!

439
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,513
Who's this?
- Don't push!

440
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,151
Quinlan? - He's in here, makin'
a search. - What am I doin here?

441
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,757
Oh, Hank!
- What's the idea, barging in on me?

442
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,799
What've we got in here?
- I came to give you your cane!

443
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,354
Strange. When I was taking Mrs. Vargas
to the motel, I picked this guy up.

444
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,877
That's Uncle Joe Grandi.
Why'd you bring him here?

445
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,238
For some crazy reason,
he was following me in his car.

446
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,676
He was tailin' you?

447
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,435
Why would I be following a cop?
He's an idiot!

448
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:18,439
Maybe you thought he was
a Mexican cop. It was Vargas' car.

449
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,389
Right? - So I thought I was following
Vargas. So what?

450
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,199
Sit down!

451
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,353
It's a free country.
- Shut up!

452
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,916
Is this the Mirador? I'm tryin'...
- Yes, it's the Mirador, and it's me.

453
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:47,709
Darling, the news is bad. Quinlan is
about to arrest that boy, Sanchez.

454
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,318
Is that why you called? To tell me
somebody's been arrested?

455
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,310
No, that's not really why I called.

456
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,192
It's to tell you
how sorry I am about all this,

457
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,795
how very, very much I love you.

458
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,549
Susie?

459
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,633
I'm still here, my darling Miguel.

460
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,431
I thought maybe you fell asleep.

461
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,876
I was just listening to you breathe.
It's a lovely sound.

462
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,076
But I am sleepy.

463
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,712
Of course. Well, I'll be calling you
back later. Goodbye for now.

464
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,877
Hello?
- Yes?

465
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,909
I just wanted to tell you,
I'm awfully tired...

466
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:48,314
Excuse me, this is Mrs Vargas.
- I know. It couldn't be anybody else.

467
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,795
You're the only guest
we got here now. In the whole place.

468
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,593
As I started to tell you:
There's no sign to put up on the door,

469
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,231
and I just wanted to be sure
I wouldn't be disturbed.

470
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,517
That is, if you're the one in charge.

471
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,959
Don't worry, Mrs. Vargas.
I'm the one in charge here.

472
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,670
Nobody'll get through to you,
unless I say so.

473
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,992
Vargas. Sergeant Menzies
wanted me to give you this.

474
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,039
Your car keys.
- Thanks.

475
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,629
I thought we lost you for good.
- I had a call to make.

476
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,119
English!

477
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,516
I'm being set up as the fall guy.
- Just a minute!

478
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,878
Sure, I'm the fortune-hunter
who hypnotized Marcia,

479
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,271
who made her kill her father
for his money.

480
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,036
If I had that kind of power,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

481
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,874
So you don't care about the money?

482
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,874
Why should I lie? Without the money,
I wouldn't have given her...

483
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,953
I told her that from the start.
But still she wanted...

484
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,909
Why bother. You wouldn't believe it!
- Try me.

485
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,311
I'm a good listener.

486
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,269
Instead of the man chasing the girl,
suppose she was the one.

487
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,477
Suppose she asked him to marry her.

488
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,953
Should he say: "No, you and I
could never be happy with your money?"

489
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,669
What would you do?
- What did you do?

490
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,756
What did you do, boy?
- You know what I did, Captain!

491
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,359
Marcia and I made a bomb,
and we blew up her father!

492
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,594
You don't help yourself
by treating this as a joke.

493
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,675
You finished?
Anything more you want to say, Vargas?

494
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,755
No, Captain.
- Good. Pete, search the place.

495
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,472
I'm too tired for this. Sanchez' desk
has been looked into.

496
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,997
Take the bedroom and bathroom.

497
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,598
And be very thorough.

498
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,075
How long do I have to sit here?
I wasn't breaking the law!

499
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,278
I don't even know these people.
- You know Vargas. - Who's this?

500
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:59,470
Uncle Joe Grandi. You nabbed
his brother on a narcotics rap.

501
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,112
I don't know this Grandi.
- I got nothing to do with your wife.

502
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,116
I'm an American citizen. Listen,
Vic was arrested in Mexico City.

503
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,638
Vargas will testify at his trial.
It's got nothing to do with...

504
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,795
You just try any rough stuff,
and you got big trouble.

505
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,475
If anybody lays a hand on Vargas,
my brother's as good as convicted.

506
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,519
Hank? - What is it, Pete?
- I found it!

507
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,037
Found what, partner?
- Come in here and look!

508
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,991
I don't even know this Sanchez.
- Alright, boy. Come in here.

509
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,119
Just how much dynamite did you steal?

510
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,751
I've never seen any dynamite!
- Poor Rudy Linnekar.

511
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,832
He did everything
to keep you away from his daughter,

512
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,277
but she'll inherit a million bucks,
so you just moved in.

513
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,990
We married secretly.
- A million bucks ain't no secret.

514
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,994
You got scared he'd change his will.

515
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,198
You got yourself this highway job.
- You broke into the explosives bin!

516
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,912
That's a lie! - You stole
10 sticks of dynamite. - No! No!

517
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,709
Hank's done it again.
He's nailed his man!

518
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,634
Thanks to you, partner.
- Me? Nah!

519
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,237
If that dynamite had been a snake,
it would've bitten me.

520
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,077
I promised to keep you informed.
This is it. We've broken the case.

521
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,836
Linnekar was blown up
with 8 sticks of dynamite.

522
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,754
Sanchez stole 10, that leaves 2.

523
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,392
And we found them both.
You heard that, boy.

524
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,872
That's impossible! Where did you find
this? - Right here in your love nest.

525
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,032
Where?
- Where you had it stashed.

526
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,795
What are you trying to do?
- Strap you to the electric chair.

527
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,919
We don't like it when innocent people
are blown up in our town.

528
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,596
Last night an old lady
picked up a shoe.

529
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,037
The shoe had a foot in it.
We'll make you pay for that.

530
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,718
They're trying to railroad me!
I never stole any dynamite!

531
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,713
You'll have to stop him yourself.
- He can talk Hindu for all I care.

532
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,830
He swears on his mother's grave that
there was never any dynamite here.

533
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,196
Sure, sure...

534
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,200
Take him in. Book him.
- Let's go.

535
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,511
You say you found this dynamite in the
bathroom. - Pete found it. Show him.

536
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,276
Can't you do something to help me?

537
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,837
What are you scared of, partner?

538
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,789
That stuff doesn't blow up as easy
as people think.

539
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,318
You found the dynamite in this box?
- Dynamite?

540
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,792
Yeah, Pete found it. I told you that.

541
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,792
Captain...
- Yeah?

542
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:47,948
I looked in that box, just now.
There wasn't anything there.

543
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,512
I know how you feel.

544
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,309
Do you?
- Sure I do.

545
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,950
You people are touchy.

546
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,558
It's only human you'd want to
defend your fellow countrymen.

547
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,996
Vargas, don't worry.
- Why should I worry?

548
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,598
Go ahead and say what you want.
Folks'll bear your prejudice in mind.

549
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,039
I saw that shoe box ten minutes ago.
- Well, maybe you didn't notice.

550
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,319
I knocked it over. I couldn't have
failed to notice 2 sticks of dynamite.

551
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,996
Tell any story you want!
Go and say it was empty.

552
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,915
I'm saying more than that, Captain.

553
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,959
You framed that boy. Framed him!

554
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,189
Is he crazy, Hank?
- That must be it, crazy.

555
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,797
What are we gonna go with Grandi?
Take him in? - Grandi.

556
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,794
You ought to realize,
if Vargas is willing to testify...

557
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,714
Who are you working for,
the Mexican government?

558
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,917
No, for the District Attorney.

559
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,630
I got a position in this town,
a reputation! Who's Vargas?

560
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,749
Vargas has, too. Somebody'll have to
give in on this thing.

561
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,991
Either that or somebody'll be ruined.

562
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,960
Captain Quinlan...
- What do you want?

563
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,038
You saw that shoebox.
You know it was empty.

564
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,876
I didn't happen
to see it myself, but...

565
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,157
I believe you.

566
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,117
We're are both after
the same exact thing, Captain.

567
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,478
If Vargas goes on like this...

568
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,351
Move along. Stop making trouble.
- Trouble? Who's making trouble?

569
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,594
Vargas! For my brother Vic
in Mexico City, for you here.

570
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,072
Go peddle your papers, Uncle Joe.
- You just said it yourself:

571
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:53,953
Somebody's reputation'll be ruined.
Why not Vargas?

572
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:59,115
What are you waitin' for?
We got work to do! - Okay, Hank.

573
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,910
What do you want?
- Nothing that you don't want, too.

574
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,072
Spit it out then.

575
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,074
Captain,
we can't stand here in the street.

576
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:14,828
Let's go somewhere nice and private,
where we can sit and have a drink.

577
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,275
I don't drink.

578
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,279
Look, Schwartz...
- Al.

579
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,240
We must show where
Quinlan himself got the dynamite.

580
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,598
If you're really with me on this,
we have to get some proof.

581
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,275
We've got your word.
- Let's do better than that.

582
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,559
In your country, too, when explosives
are purchased, a record is kept.

583
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,475
And we're going to look it up.
How about Quinlan's ranch?

584
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,950
Where's that?
- Just outside town.

585
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,432
While you're looking for the records,
I'll go out there.

586
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,037
One thing worries me still.
- What's that?

587
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,592
I could be wrong about this.
That would be very bad for you.

588
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,468
Let's see if you're wrong first.

589
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,514
Could you turn that music off?

590
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,677
Could you ask
those people next door to move?

591
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,752
I'm trying to sleep.

592
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,515
Where should I take you, doll?

593
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,838
You got the stuff?

594
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,754
I brought that.
The other guys got more.

595
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,792
What are you doing here?
Turn it down!

596
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,314
I'm the night man.
- Yeah?

597
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,350
A little early, ain't you?
- I thought I'd see if the new...

598
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,956
Which one of you is the day man?
- I am!

599
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,588
Beat it.

600
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,677
It's a mile and a half
down to the highway...

601
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,391
I think I'd better stay. - Go in
the kitchen and get something to eat.

602
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:35,033
I brought my lunch.
- Eat it now.

603
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,839
Now?

604
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,358
I know you. You're the Grandi boys.

605
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,389
Your Uncle Joe know you're here?
- Who could that be?

606
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,269
Take it easy, pretty boy.
What's the sweat about?

607
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,993
It's a tough rap to get caught with
this! - It's only the Vargas dame.

608
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,312
Yes Ma'am?
- Get me 1-2-1-2.

609
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,757
Very good. 1-2-1-2.

610
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,356
That's the police!
- Yeah?

611
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,034
It's the police alright.

612
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,068
What do we do now?
- Nothing...

613
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,029
Just relax and have ourselves a ball.

614
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,430
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Vargas.
Phone's temporarily out of service.

615
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,150
I'll call you
just as soon as it's repaired.

616
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,913
Better call Uncle Joe.

617
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,156
So that is our little arrangement?

618
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,596
A real sweet setup.

619
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,155
And all the help...
- Listen, if you knock somebody off,

620
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,599
there won't be any little arrangement.
Not with Hank Quinlan!

621
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,879
It's for you. - Yeah.
- Vargas can't hurt me.

622
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:13,037
Maybe not. But maybe,
with our little deal, we can hurt him.

623
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,670
I don't make deals.

624
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,677
Something wrong? - Nothing we can't
fix. - Where'd you get that "we"?

625
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,355
I haven't given you an answer yet.

626
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,309
You talk like this was some deal
where I ask you

627
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:44,272
to get me out of a rap.
No, that ain't it at all.

628
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:49,151
In this thing we're partners.
Shall we drink to that?

629
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,232
I don't...

630
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,791
Juanita, two more double bourbons.

631
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,190
Make 'em nice and big.

632
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,434
This better be important!
- It is.

633
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:36,517
We're crazy to even be here in Mexico.
- Vargas, you sent for us?

634
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:42,040
Not really. Mr. Schwartz insisted
that I... - Let's get to the case.

635
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,512
Chief Gould, Mr. Vargas.
- Where's this so-called document?

636
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,797
Perhaps we'd better go to my room.

637
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,076
In here, gentlemen.
- Go ahead. - No, I'll walk.

638
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,029
The lift is rather small.
Chief Gould...

639
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:02,356
Just press the second floor button,
I'll meet you there.

640
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,591
I still don't know
why Vargas couldn't come to my office.

641
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,278
He has practically cabinet status.
- If he's so important...

642
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,959
He can't make a formal call on you
without going though his consulate.

643
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,590
Cut the fancy talk.
What does it boil down to?

644
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,471
This Mexican's bringing charges
against a respected police officer!

645
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,110
That's what it boils down to!

646
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,114
You must be quick on your feet!

647
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:34,274
The lift is just slow.
This way, gentlemen.

648
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,353
Thank you.

649
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,876
I have it right over here.

650
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,355
There.

651
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,550
While you're looking at it,
allow me to finish a call.

652
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:59,349
Where'd you get this?
- From your department of records.

653
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,512
It doesn't mean anything!

654
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,193
Are you calling your wife?
You know who owns the Mirador?

655
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,388
June 18,
Hill's Hardware in Los Robles.

656
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,429
17 sticks, "Black Fox" brand,
to H. Quinlan.

657
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,752
Quinlan needed dynamite
for his ranch. Simple coincidence.

658
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,231
Mr. Adair... Hello?

659
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:28,318
Mirador? My name is Vargas.
I'd like to speak with my wife.

660
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,190
I'm very sorry, but your wife
left definite instructions.

661
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,953
She's not to be disturbed.

662
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,115
Honey!

663
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,875
You, in the next room!

664
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,359
What is it?

665
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,275
Come to the wall,
so I can whisper.

666
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,035
Yes?

667
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,875
You know what the boys
are trying to do, don't you?

668
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:06,149
They're trying to get in there.
They went to get the master key.

669
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,232
You know
what marijuana is, don't you?

670
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,919
Yes...

671
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,309
You know what a Mary Jane is?

672
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,278
You know what a mainliner is?

673
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,788
I think so.
But what's that got to do with me?

674
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,157
You take it in the vein.

675
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,069
You're telling me
the boys are drugged? Is that why...

676
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,718
You think
they're ready for that stuff yet?

677
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,951
Not yet, kid.

678
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,076
The fun is only beginning.

679
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,870
Hank, I've been looking
for you in every bar in town.

680
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,637
I've been in half of them,
only on the wrong side of the border.

681
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,318
I never drink on my own beat.
- Give us some black coffee, quick!

682
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:11,714
I don't need black coffee. - We're
meeting Vargas at his hotel. - Motel?

683
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:16,079
Right here, across the street.
- I don't need any coffee yet.

684
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,469
Not yet?

685
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,475
This is a swell time to get fried!
- My job's over, Pete.

686
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,677
You oughtta work on Sanchez.

687
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,868
Vargas is telling the D.A.
That you planted the dynamite. - Fool.

688
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,838
They're takin' him seriously.

689
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,916
I mean Sanchez. Dynamite's no way
to kill. Did I tell you the smart way?

690
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:39,279
Sure. Strangling.
- Clean, silent.

691
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,069
You told me all that.
Come on, finish your coffee.

692
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,837
I don't usually talk about my wife.
- Never when you're sober.

693
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,674
She was strangled, Pete.
- I know.

694
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:55,279
She was working at a packing plant.
The killer had the cord right there.

695
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,719
No fingerprints on a piece of string.
- What do I owe you?

696
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,954
That half-breed done it.
But I was just a rooky cop.

697
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,351
$ 4.75.

698
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,355
I followed him around,
eating my heart out,

699
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,514
tryin' to catch him,
but I never did.

700
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:19,311
Then the Lord done the job for me
in some mud-hole in Belgium in 1917.

701
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,235
That was the last killer
that ever got out of my hands.

702
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,154
Where're you going?
- To Señor Vargas' meeting.

703
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,792
He wants to fight dirty, OK.
That's the fight he's gonna get.

704
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,918
Perhaps...
- What?

705
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,359
Perhaps he honestly thinks Sanchez
is guilty. - No "perhaps" about it.

706
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,036
Hank Quinlan is an honest cop.
- There are all kinds of policemen.

707
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,000
A few take bribes...

708
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,073
Quinlan never took a dollar.
- Most are honest, yes...

709
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:52,759
But even some of the honest men
abuse their power in other ways.

710
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,354
Come in, Hank.

711
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,797
I don't know
whether I'm welcome or not.

712
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,668
I want you to hear this.

713
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,991
I've heard it already.

714
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,517
Our friend Vargas has some
special ideas about police procedure.

715
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,435
Seems to think it don't matter
whether a killer is hanged or not.

716
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,308
A policeman isn't a dog-catcher,

717
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,075
putting criminals behind bars. No!

718
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,597
In a free country, a policeman
is supposed to enforce the law.

719
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,958
The law protects guilty and innocent.
- Our job is tough enough.

720
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,635
It has to be tough.

721
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:34,352
A policeman's job is only easy
in a police state. That's the point!

722
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,558
Who's the boss, the cop or the law?

723
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,190
Where's your wife, Vargas?

724
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:45,628
You know as well as I do.
Sgt. Menzies drove her to the motel.

725
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,669
You're still here?

726
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:52,789
I'm checking out now and joining her.
Any reason for asking?

727
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,555
No. No special reason at all.

728
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,076
I just wondered...

729
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:02,715
Whaddya know! Mother pigeon
and her nest...

730
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,314
A pigeon egg.

731
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,154
You did buy 17 sticks of dynamite?

732
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,757
You're telling a story.
I don't have to answer your questions.

733
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,551
The hired hand at your ranch says
he used 15 sticks. - My ranch!

734
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,438
You been spying out at my ranch?

735
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,310
Foreigner!
- Without my knowledge, Hank!

736
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:28,077
15 sticks. That leaves 2 missing, and
2 sticks were found in that shoebox!

737
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,550
He's just asking, Hank.

738
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,910
What's that for?

739
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,071
It's for letting him ask.
- Hank, wait!

740
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:44,079
30 years! 30 years on the beat,
30 years of dirt and crummy pay...

741
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,596
Watch your blood pressure!
- And you allow this foreigner...

742
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,198
We were just giving you
a chance to answer. - Answer? No, sir!

743
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,469
I won't take back that badge until
the people of this county vote for it!

744
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,438
Will you listen a minute?

745
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:02,355
I don't ever want to see that man
at headquarters again!

746
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:06,833
You backed him up! You stood by
while he impugned the integrity...

747
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,391
I tried to stop him!
- You realize what Vargas has done?

748
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,792
He's smearing hundreds of fine men!

749
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,909
Have you caused enough trouble?
I want you to apologize!

750
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,389
To Quinlan?
- And Chief Gould!

751
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,110
Should I get on my knees?
- If you had any decency, you would!

752
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:28,355
I won't give you the chance
to test your authority in this matter.

753
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,878
Al, have I still
any credit left with you?

754
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:42,638
Some. - Where can I find the records
of Quinlan's old cases?

755
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:47,113
I'll show you. - I'd like to get back
to my wife. I hope it won't take long.

756
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,350
Hank, you're not going without this.

757
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,988
Well...

758
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:03,157
Now I guess I can talk.
- What do you mean, Hank?

759
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,678
Well, I couldn't really say it
in my own defense. - Go on, Hank.

760
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,355
What do you know about Vargas?

761
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:14,116
Isn't he in charge of some cleanup
on this side of the border?

762
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,318
Narcotics, mainly?
- Narcotics...

763
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,430
He's a drug addict.

764
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,559
He's got
that young wife of his hooked, too.

765
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:28,829
If I hadn't seen that hypodermic
myself... - Hypodermic! You saw it?

766
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,755
I just said so, didn't I?
- Are you sure?

767
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:37,631
That's how he come to imagine
all those crazy things. It's typical.

768
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:41,191
That's what his wife was doing
in that dive on skid row.

769
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:46,720
Both a couple of junkies.
He's usin' the job as a cover-up.

770
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,640
You don't mean he's mixed up
in this dope racket himself?

771
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,917
Hank, if this
is just one of your hunches...

772
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:58,155
I don't ask you to believe it.
I know it's not my department, but...

773
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,072
I'd like to show you I'm not
talking out of the back of my neck.

774
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,075
Just be careful, huh?
- Chief, I'll be very careful.

775
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,589
This takes guts, Al.
Standing up to your boss this way.

776
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,710
You could do me a favor: Help me
look for an office. - How's that?

777
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,510
Quinlan's intuition may still turn out
to be better that yours.

778
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,833
If so, my intuition tells me I'll be
going back to private practice.

779
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,233
Here are the other names you want.
- Look, I can finish this alone.

780
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,835
And maybe you can't.

781
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,598
Well, let me try anyway.

782
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,514
I have no right
to drag you further into this.

783
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,559
Gonna do it alone, huh?
Just solve the murder,

784
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,430
and also prove that the idol
of the police force is a fraud.

785
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:50,789
Amigo, you've got your work
really cut out for you.

786
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,158
Hello Tanya. Is Captain Quinlan there?

787
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,036
Now, Sargeant!
- Tanya!

788
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:43,998
I'll be right there!

789
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,154
What would Quinlan be doing here?

790
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:52,439
He used to hole himself up at your
place for days with a case of whiskey.

791
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,037
That was years ago.
Now he's on candy bars.

792
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,555
Not tonight.

793
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,552
No, lemme stay. I wanna watch.

794
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,471
Hold her legs!

795
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,711
No, let me go! Don't touch me! No!

796
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,791
Close the door.

797
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,995
So, this is where
you've been all afternoon?

798
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,151
How'd they let you in here?
A foreigner.

799
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:33,792
Hall of records is open to the public.
- What are you doing?

800
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:38,512
You'll find out tomorrow morning.
- I want to know now!

801
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:46,115
What's all this?
- Records of every case

802
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,512
where you or Quinlan
uncovered the principle evidence.

803
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:55,438
In each case, the defense denied
the existence of that evidence.

804
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,436
Are you tryin' to break him?

805
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,273
Him?

806
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,796
What about you?

807
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,714
You never
planted any evidence, Sergeant?

808
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,429
Of course not. Neither did Hank!

809
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:12,958
It's all there: The axe in the Burger
murder, the dentures in the Yule case.

810
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,396
Planting evidence, framing suspects!

811
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,109
That's a lie!
- I think I can prove it, Sergeant.

812
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:21,751
Sure, you can smear him,

813
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,994
ruin his whole life's work.

814
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,992
Vargas, I don't even know where he is.

815
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,473
That's what you've done to him.
- What I've done? - Yeah...

816
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,270
He's on an important case,
and he's disappeared.

817
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,510
Good and drunk, probably.

818
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,875
After 12 years on the wagon.

819
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,796
That's what you've done to him.

820
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,148
What about Quinlan, Sergeant?

821
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,233
What's he done?

822
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:01,315
What about all those people
he put in the death-house?

823
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,232
Save your tears for them.

824
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,510
What seems to be the trouble?
- Trouble?

825
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:33,471
The lights. The lights
seem to be out in all the cabins.

826
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,751
Somebody's been
monkeyin' with them fuses.

827
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:43,197
If they think I'm gonna fix 'em,
they got another thing comin'.

828
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,956
It ain't my job to fix 'em,
even if I know how.

829
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,670
Could you please
show me to my wife's cabin?

830
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,473
No.

831
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,269
Ain't nobody here.

832
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:04,231
You must be mistaken. My wife's been
registered here since this morning.

833
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,992
My name is Vargas.

834
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,957
Vargas? - Would you look
in the register, please?

835
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,112
The register?

836
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,950
It might be cabin 6.
- Possibly...

837
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,279
Maybe 7.
- Yes... here.

838
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,553
May I?

839
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:41,835
There's nobody
been registered all week.

840
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:45,789
No, it's off the season.

841
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,953
Nobody hardly comes around at all.

842
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,875
I'm the night man.

843
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,630
There was that party...

844
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,588
Party? What party?

845
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,312
It's a mess, awful mess.
- Where?

846
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,359
If they think I'm gonna clean it up,
they got another thing comin'.

847
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,796
Terrible brawl.

848
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,633
Cabin number 7.

849
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,754
In the middle of the afternoon!
Cabin number 7.

850
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:40,115
This brawl. You mean
there was some sort of fight?

851
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,112
Fight?
- Yes.

852
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:46,229
No.
No, it wasn't that kind of a brawl.

853
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:55,390
It was one of them wild parties.
You know the kind?

854
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,511
This can't be my wife's room.

855
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,480
This ain't her clothes, huh?

856
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,394
It stinks in here!

857
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:26,439
Let's get some air in here.

858
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,109
It's a mess, it's a stinkin' mess!
Those wild parties!

859
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:36,229
There's my briefcase.
I left it with Susan, it...

860
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,035
I'm gettin' outta here!

861
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,590
My gun!

862
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,039
You haven't been here?
You haven't been in that room?

863
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:58,150
I just looked in.
- I had a gun in this case!

864
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,348
You didn't take it?
- What would I want with a gun?

865
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,876
Well, somebody wanted it!

866
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,760
If they hadn't put that Grandi boy
on the desk this morning,

867
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,991
this wouldn't have happened.
- Grandi?

868
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:15,188
Who d'you think this belongs to?
- Where are they?

869
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,275
The kids?
- Yes.

870
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,715
Please!

871
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,953
Rancho!
- Rancho Grande? - Yes.

872
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,350
You got her undressed?
- We scattered the reefers around.

873
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,389
You didn't use
none of that stuff yourselves, huh?

874
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,153
You think we're crazy?

875
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:11,348
No Grandi gets hooked.
Understand? That's the rule.

876
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,512
We blew smoke on her clothes,
that's all.

877
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,639
We put on a good show, to scare her.

878
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,870
Let's hope it was good enough.

879
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:24,717
When she wakes up, she's gotta think
maybe something did happen.

880
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:29,079
Now beat it.
- What about our dough?

881
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:33,678
We weren't doing it for fun.
- You'll get your dough tomorrow.

882
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,229
Okay.

883
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,789
Beat it.

884
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,114
Turn out the light.
- Why?

885
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,670
Nobody can see you up here.

886
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:29,475
You sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

887
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,798
What are you doing?

888
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:42,438
I brought you up here for a reason.
- I don't get it.

889
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:48,233
I don't even see why we had to
bring her all the way to town.

890
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,837
I couldn't drive out to the motel.
My car's known.

891
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,231
So what?
You're a cop making an arrest.

892
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,949
The vice boys will do that.

893
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,998
What's that for?

894
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,719
Turn around!

895
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:12,795
Get the phone.

896
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,274
Now dial 1-2-1-2.

897
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,114
That's the police!
- Go on, dial it!

898
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:31,439
Stop, Quinlan. You're drunk.
Just stop and think for a minute!

899
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,390
See if they answer.

900
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,717
Ask for Sergeant Menzies.

901
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,717
Sergeant Menzies.

902
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:53,398
Quinlan, if you turn me in,
I'll have quite a story to tell.

903
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,116
You sure will.

904
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,792
See if it's Menzies.
- Hello? Menzies?

905
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,919
Got him?
Hand me the phone.

906
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,675
Hold it so I can talk.
Give me the receiver!

907
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,793
Hello, Pete!

908
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,470
Of course it's me.
Any news yet?

909
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,799
Sanchez still hasn't broken.

910
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,949
What?

911
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,678
Vargas' wife? A narcotics rap?

912
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:29,471
One of the boys
was onto this wild party.

913
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:37,828
Just relay it to the vice boys
as anonymous. Hotel Ritz, room 18.

914
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:43,953
Things got a little out of control.
Don't be surprised what they find.

915
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,958
What about me, Hank? What do I do?

916
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:51,238
Keep after him! Break him!

917
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,396
Put up the phone.

918
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,078
The receiver!

919
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,357
Gimme the key.

920
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:16,916
I told you
I brought you up for a reason.

921
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,990
Help! Somebody help me!

922
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:07,159
Listen, I'm no cop now,
I'm a husband!

923
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:11,838
What did you do with her?
Where's my wife? My wife!

924
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:29,870
Vargas!

925
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,356
It's your wife, Vargas.
They picked her up.

926
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:39,434
What do you mean, "picked her up"?
- The vice squad.

927
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,989
Quinlan?

928
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,994
You better come out with me, amigo.

929
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,553
No, don't. Tell me what happened!
- They found her at the Hotel Ritz,

930
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,076
half-naked on the bed, drugged.

931
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,436
There were reefer stubs
and a heroin fix.

932
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:58,989
Vargas!

933
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,752
The charge isn't just possession
of narcotics. - What is it then?

934
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,758
Murder.

935
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,957
Darling... it's alright now, Susie.

936
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:34,351
It's all in the report.
They found evidence of a mixed party.

937
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,559
Mixed party? - Articles of clothing,
half-smoked reefers, needle marks.

938
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:44,155
Could've been something else:
Demerol or sodium pentothal.

939
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:49,108
You could smell the stuff on her.
- This whole setup stinks!

940
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,718
Who does Quinlan think he is,
hanging a murder rap on my wife?

941
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,717
Susie, lie down.

942
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,189
Take me home.

943
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,478
Forgive me.

944
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,869
Don't go!
- I'm right here.

945
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:20,908
It's alright.

946
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:46,549
You know there's no formal charge
against your wife? - Oh?

947
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:52,876
Even vice isn't pressing anything.
- And that makes everything alright?

948
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:58,957
I got something to show you!
- Her good name hasn't been touched!

949
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:25,239
I found it in the hotel room.

950
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:30,117
With Grandi's body.

951
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:29,909
He's still just sitting in there.
- We've been waiting 3 hours already.

952
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,232
We won't get a word on this,
as long as he's near that piano.

953
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:39,272
Would you go in and shut it off?
- No, I have to get him out.

954
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:42,558
Give me the microphone.
- I can take care of this.

955
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,552
Not without me.

956
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,396
You know that Grandi kid we picked up?

957
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,519
Stand quietly.
- He started to talk.

958
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:56,710
He says the kids were all faking.
Your wife wasn't really on dope.

959
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:00,317
Doc says it was only that truth stuff.
- Sodium pentothal.

960
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:03,439
No harm in it at all.
- No harm?

961
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,718
Schwartz is driving your car
across the border.

962
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:11,477
I told him we'd be by the bridge.
He's bringing your wife along.

963
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,872
She's feeling fine.
Doc says she can travel.

964
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,477
Sergeant... - Look, she just wants
to catch the early plane out of here.

965
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,395
How can I leave here
until my wife's name is clean?

966
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,791
What are you
carrying that microphone for?

967
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,510
Remember, don't cross your arms.
- I know, I know.

968
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,593
I've got to get the truth
from Quinlan. On tape!

969
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,310
He could stay there
the rest of the week, like he used to.

970
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:39,190
Look, just take your wife home
and let me handle this. It's my job!

971
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,556
It's my job too, Menzies.

972
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:48,153
You think I like it? I hate
this machine, spying, creeping...

973
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,632
How d'you think I feel about it?
Hank is the best friend I had.

974
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:55,828
That's one reason for my staying.
- Oh, you don't trust me?

975
01:29:56,240 --> 01:30:00,438
Don't forget, I didn't have to
show you that cane.

976
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:04,594
Oh, yes you did, Sergeant.
- Somebody could've planted it there.

977
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,390
Besides Grandi's corpse.
- You know better than that.

978
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,394
You say the reefers were planted.
Why not Hank's cane?

979
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:15,236
You're an honest cop.
- Sure I am.

980
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:20,313
And who made me an honest cop?
Hank Quinlan. - Come on, Menzies.

981
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:23,314
I am what I am because of him.

982
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,275
What's my fortune?

983
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,196
You've been reading the cards, right?

984
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:45,433
I've been doing the accounts.

985
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,674
Come on, read my future for me.

986
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:56,512
You haven't got any.
- What do you mean?

987
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,357
Your future's all used up.

988
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:08,716
Why don't you go home?

989
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:26,793
Vargas?

990
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:31,830
I don't know if you can hear him
over that music, but I'll get him out.

991
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:06,951
I'll get him out, away from the music.
Be sure he doesn't see you.

992
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,471
I must be drunk.

993
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,798
A minute ago,

994
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:18,999
I thought you were Vargas.

995
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:22,028
Come on out, Hank.
- What's that?

996
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:25,000
Come on out, Hank, I'm tired.
- Who told you to come here?

997
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:28,358
I'm tired of waitin', Hank.
I've some questions you gotta answer.

998
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:32,870
Questions?

999
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:37,389
I need another drink.
- You had enough.

1000
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:41,509
That's what Tanya keeps tellin' me.
How much is enough?

1001
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,869
Hank, I'm sick of chasing around...
- You could use a drink yourself.

1002
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:53,955
You gotta answer, Hank.
First, about Vargas' gun...

1003
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,475
How d'you know about that?

1004
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,710
He thinks you took it.
- Vargas?

1005
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,714
Or was it Grandi who stole it?

1006
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,951
You been talkin' to Vargas?

1007
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:10,478
Then you took it from Grandi?
- You been gettin' kinda chummy.

1008
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,190
Does that explain
that thing you're carrying?

1009
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:17,036
What's it called,

1010
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:19,232
that thing you're wearing?

1011
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:23,358
What I'm wearing?
- Sure...

1012
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,389
That halo.
- Halo?

1013
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,995
Looks real pretty on you.

1014
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:34,358
Soon you'll be
flappin' your wings like an angel.

1015
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:41,549
Look out.

1016
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:46,392
Vargas'll turn you into
one of these starry-eyed idealists.

1017
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,916
They make all the real trouble.

1018
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:52,990
They're worse than crooks. You can
always do something with a crook.

1019
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:56,153
You're the one
that should be careful, Hank.

1020
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,393
Sometimes you can be a crook, too.
Look what happened with Grandi.

1021
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:04,032
Partner,
nobody ever called me a crook.

1022
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:10,478
Look up there.

1023
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,234
See?

1024
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,469
That oil pump, pumpin' up money?

1025
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:20,989
Money...

1026
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:25,434
Don't you think I coulda been rich?
A cop in my position?

1027
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,432
What do I have?
- Tell me about Grandi.

1028
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,879
After 30 years, a little turkey ranch,
that's all I got. A couple of acres.

1029
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:34,589
We gotta talk about Grandi.

1030
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:40,712
An honest cop.
Then this Mexican comes along,

1031
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:44,476
and look at the spot he puts me in!
- You can't blame Vargas.

1032
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:51,118
I blame Vargas, for everything.
- Don't be crazy!

1033
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:57,436
I wouldn't be in a situation
where Grandi could blackmail me.

1034
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:03,597
You must be crazy! Insane!
- Sure, sure. I'm crazy.

1035
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,471
You murdered Grandi. - I left my cane
by his body. That was sure crazy.

1036
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,953
Let's start in the beginning.
What about Vargas' gun?

1037
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:16,875
I was talking about my cane.
- The gun! - I forgot it.

1038
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:22,912
The gun you stole from
Vargas' briefcase! Vargas' gun!

1039
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:25,356
All you wanna talk about is Vargas!

1040
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:30,754
You took the gun,
but you didn't use it.

1041
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:35,517
Grandi was strangled. - Grandi was
a crook. - You're a killer, Hank.

1042
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,639
Partner, I'm a cop.
- Yeah, yeah...

1043
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:42,715
Drunk and crazy as you must've been
when you strangled him.

1044
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:47,159
I guess you were thinking
of your wife, how she was strangled.

1045
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:52,680
I guess I'm always thinking of her,
drunk or sober.

1046
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:59,232
What else is there to think about,
except my job, my dirty job?

1047
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:03,879
You didn't have to make it dirty.
- It's not dirty. Look at the record.

1048
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,037
Our record, partner.
- Sure, sure...

1049
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:10,795
All those convictions...

1050
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,953
Convictions, sure.
How many did you frame?

1051
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:15,634
Nobody.

1052
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:19,919
Come on. How many did you frame?
- I told you: Nobody!

1053
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:23,835
Nobody that wasn't guilty.

1054
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,917
Guilty, guilty.

1055
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,949
Every last one of 'em: Guilty.

1056
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,514
All these years,
you've been playing me for a sucker.

1057
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,639
Faking evidence.
- Aiding justice, partner.

1058
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:41,157
Like the axe in the Burger case.
- Yeah, remember that?

1059
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:43,391
I found the axe.

1060
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:48,920
Just where you planted it.
Just like the dynamite with Sanchez!

1061
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:53,074
Don't you think that Sanchez's guilty?
He's guilty. He'll confess.

1062
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,548
Hey, listen to that!

1063
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:02,312
Hank...
- Hear that?

1064
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:06,790
Hear what?
- An echo.

1065
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,479
Vargas?

1066
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,275
I feel he's someplace around here.

1067
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,432
Close to me.

1068
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,750
I got a hunch.
- Why Vargas? Why should he...

1069
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,720
You sound nervous, Pete.

1070
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,794
My old game leg...

1071
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:45,391
...is starting to talk to me.

1072
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:47,710
Vargas...

1073
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:58,835
Maybe he's tailin' me with a bug.

1074
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:02,798
Recording.

1075
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:09,393
You carryin' a bug for him?
A microphone? Don't lie to me!

1076
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:14,669
Alright...
- Where is he? Where is he?

1077
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:18,311
Why did you try to frame Vargas?
- Frame? Who's been framed?

1078
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,358
Where is he?

1079
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:25,513
I'm talkin' to Vargas now.

1080
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,399
You hear me?

1081
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,554
I'm talkin' to you, via this walking
microphone that used to work for me.

1082
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,872
I ain't workin' for Vargas.
I'm working for the department.

1083
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:40,398
Hank, give me Vargas' gun!
- OK, here it is. Vargas!

1084
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:36,191
Well, Captain...

1085
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:40,479
I'm afraid this is something
you can't talk your way out of.

1086
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,599
You want to bet?

1087
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:51,592
You killed him, Vargas.
- Come on, give me my gun back.

1088
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:57,589
You don't understand me.
You killed Pete.

1089
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,831
The bullet is from your gun.

1090
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:06,077
You think anyone would believe that?
- They always believe me.

1091
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,472
Anyway,
they'd never believe I killed him.

1092
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:14,393
The gun.
- You resisting arrest?

1093
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,918
How could you arrest me here?
This is my country.

1094
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,559
This is where you're gonna die.

1095
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:29,913
That wasn't a miss, Vargas.
That was just to turn you around.

1096
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:36,839
I don't wanna shoot you in the back.
Unless you'd rather try to run.

1097
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:00,869
Schwartz!

1098
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:04,113
Did you bring my wife?
- She's in the car.

1099
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:08,274
That's Menzies. He's dead. Quinlan's
been shot too. He's lying there.

1100
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:13,879
I've got it on tape. - You sure you
got enough? - Play it back and see.

1101
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:30,196
All these years,
you've been playing me for a sucker.

1102
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:35,071
Faking evidence.
- Aiding justice, partner.

1103
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:45,673
It's all over, Susie.
I'm taking you home. Home.

1104
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:53,198
How many did you frame?
- Nobody that wasn't guilty.

1105
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:57,718
Hank! - I ain't workin' for Vargas.
- Vargas! Vargas!

1106
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:01,795
You better give me the gun.
- OK, there it is.

1107
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:05,709
Pete...

1108
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,556
That's the second bullet
I stopped for you.

1109
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:33,672
His intuition was right after all.
He framed that Mexican Sanchez,

1110
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:38,399
but he didn't even need to.
The kid confessed about that bomb.

1111
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:43,439
Turns out Quinlan was right.

1112
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:47,352
Is anybody gonna come take him away?
- Yeah, in a few minutes.

1113
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:51,634
You really liked him, didn't you?

1114
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:56,477
The cop did.
The one who killed him. He loved him.

1115
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:01,749
Hank was a great detective alright.
- And a lousy cop.

1116
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:04,674
Is that all you have to say for him?

1117
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:07,594
He was some kind of a man.

1118
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:13,990
What does it matter
what you say about people?

1119
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:21,757
Goodbye, Tanya.

1120
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:24,034
Adios.
