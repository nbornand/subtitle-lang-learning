<i>On November 1, 1959, the population
of New York City was 8,042,783.</i>

3
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:53,877
<i>If you laid them all end to end, figuring
an average height of 5 feet 6½ inches...</i>

4
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:58,056
<i>... they would reach from Times Square
to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan.</i>

5
00:01:58,182 --> 00:02:02,595
<i>I know facts like this because I work for
an insurance company, Consolidated Life.</i>

6
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,267
<i>We're one of the top five companies
in the country.</i>

7
00:02:05,398 --> 00:02:09,182
<i>Our home office has 31,259 employees...</i>

8
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,648
<i>... which is more than the entire population
of, uh... Natchez, Mississippi.</i>

9
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:16,783
<i>I work on the 19th floor.
Ordinary Policy Department...</i>

10
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,038
<i>... Premium Accounting Division,
Section W, desk number 861.</i>

11
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:26,208
<i>My name is CC Baxter: C for Calvin, C for
Clifford. But most people call me Bud.</i>

12
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:31,497
<i>I've worked here three years, ten months,
and my take-home pay is $94.70 a week.</i>

13
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,931
<i>The hours in our department
are 8.50 to 5.20.</i>

14
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:54,861
<i>They're staggered by floor so 16 elevators
can handle the 31,259 employees...</i>

15
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:57,447
<i>... without a serious traffic jam.</i>

16
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:02,738
<i>As for myself, I very often stay on at the
office and work for an extra hour or two...</i>

17
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,951
<i>... especially when the weather is bad.</i>

18
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:08,668
<i>It's not that I'm overly ambitious.
It's just a way of killing time...</i>

19
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:11,503
<i>... until it's all right for me to go home.</i>

20
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:15,085
<i>You see, I have this little problem
with my apartment.</i>

21
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:19,931
<i>I live in the West 60s,
just half a block from Central Park.</i>

22
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:23,226
<i>My rent is $85 a month.
It used to be $80 until last July...</i>

23
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:27,269
<i>... when Mrs Lieberman, the landlady,
put in a second-hand air conditioner.</i>

24
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,071
<i>It's a real nice apartment. Nothing fancy,
but kind of cosy. Just right for a bachelor.</i>

25
00:03:33,198 --> 00:03:36,650
<i>The only problem is
I can't always get in when I want to.</i>

26
00:03:50,424 --> 00:03:53,758
Cut it out, Sylvia.
We've gotta get out of here.

27
00:03:53,886 --> 00:03:56,923
What's the panic?
I'm gonna have another martini.

28
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,215
Please, Sylvia. It's a quarter of nine.

29
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,684
First you can't wait to get me here
and then it's rush, rush, rush.

30
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:06,016
- Makes a person feel cheap.
- Sweetie, it's not that.

31
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:08,936
But I promised the guy
I'd be outta here by eight.

32
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:14,693
- What guy? Whose apartment is this?
- Some schnook that works in the office.

33
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:30,580
- Good evening, Mr Baxter.
- Mrs Lieberman.

34
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:35,675
<i>Some weather we're having. Must be from
all that meshugaas at Cape Canaveral.</i>

35
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:41,724
- You're locked out of your apartment?
- No, no. Just waiting for a friend.

36
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,639
- Good night, Mrs Lieberman.
- Good night, Mr Baxter.

37
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:06,254
- Where do you live?
- I told you. With my mother.

38
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:09,582
<i>- Where does she live?
- 179th Street, in the Bronx.</i>

39
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:14,710
- All right. I'll take you to the subway.
- Like hell you will! You'll buy me a cab.

40
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:18,760
- Why do all you dames live in the Bronx?
- You bring other girls up here?

41
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:21,763
Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.

42
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:04,223
- Hello there, Mrs Dreyfuss.
- Something's the matter?

43
00:06:04,356 --> 00:06:08,436
Uh, no. I... seem to have
dropped my key. Ah, here it is.

44
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,060
Such a racket I heard in your place.

45
00:06:11,197 --> 00:06:13,320
Maybe you had burglars?

46
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:17,910
Don't worry about that. There's nothing in
here anybody'd wanna steal. Good night.

47
00:06:56,911 --> 00:07:01,454
Sorry to bother you, Buddy-boy,
but the little lady forgot her galoshes.

48
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:05,082
Mr Kirkeby, you were supposed
to be outta here by eight.

49
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:09,790
I know, but those things don't always
run on schedule like a Greyhound bus.

50
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:12,594
I don't mind in the summer,
but on a rainy night...

51
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:15,389
- I haven't had any dinner yet.
- Sure, sure.

52
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:17,553
Oh!

53
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:21,100
I put in a good word for you
with Sheldrake in Personnel.

54
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:22,806
- Mr Sheldrake?
- That's right.

55
00:07:22,938 --> 00:07:26,888
We discussed manpower promotionwise.
I told him you're a bright boy.

56
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:31,154
They're always on the lookout for
young executives. You're on your way up.

57
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,148
- And you're also out of liquor.
- Mr Eichelberger, Mortgage and Loans...

58
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:39,745
...last night he had a Halloween party.
- Lay in some vodka and vermouth for me.

59
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:44,167
- You still owe me for the last two bottles.
- I'll pay you on Friday.

60
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:49,537
Oh, and whatever happened to those little
cheese crackers you used to have?

61
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,800
Cheese crackers?

62
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,217
Cheers.

63
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,145
- Good evening, Baxter.
- Hi, Doc. Had a late call?

64
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:57,945
Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's ate
a club sandwich - including the toothpick.

65
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,667
- Well, good night, Doc.
- Say, Baxter.

66
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,625
The way you're beltin' that stuff,
you must have cast-iron kidneys.

67
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,967
That's not me. Just once in a while
I have a few people in for a drink.

68
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,177
As a matter of fact, you must be
an iron man all around.

69
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:17,590
From what I hear through the walls,
you're at it every night.

70
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:22,186
- I'm sorry if it gets noisy.
- And sometimes there's a double-header.

71
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:26,355
<i>- A nebbish like you.
- Yeah. Well, I'll see you, Doc.</i>

72
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:30,233
You know, I'm doing some research
at the Columbia Medical Center.

73
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,652
- Could you do us a favour?
- Me?

74
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:36,614
When you make out your will -
and the way you're going, you should -

75
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:40,825
would you mind leaving
your body to the university?

76
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:45,251
My body? I'm afraid you guys'd
be disappointed. Good night, Doc.

77
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,670
Slow down, kid.

78
00:10:27,214 --> 00:10:29,254
Oh, for heaven...

79
00:10:36,724 --> 00:10:41,351
<i>From the world's greatest library
of film classics, we proudly present...</i>

00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,887

83
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:54,361
<i>But first, a word from our sponsor.</i>

84
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:58,822
<i>If you smoke the modern way,
don't be fooled by phoney filter claims.</i>

85
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:32,775
<i>And now, "Grand Hotel"...</i>

86
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:35,695
<i>... starring Greta Garbo, John Barrymore...</i>

87

<i>... Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery

88
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:43,831
<i>But first, a word
from our alternate sponsor.</i>

89
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:47,626
<i>Friends, do you have wobbly dentures?</i>

90
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:15,533
- Hello.
- Hiya, Buddy-boy.

91
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:19,493
I'm in this bar on 61st Street
and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.

92
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:22,161
That's very nice of you but... who is this?

93
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:24,784
Dobisch. Joe Dobisch, in Administration.

94
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,705
- Oh, yeah. I didn't recognise your voice.
- That's OK, Buddy-boy.

95
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:33,384
Like I was saying, I'm in this joint
on 61st and I think I got lucky.

96
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:38,595
I'm sorry, Mr Dobisch. I like to help
you fellas out, but it's sort of late.

97
00:12:38,726 --> 00:12:43,056
- Why don't we make it some other time?
- Listen, kid. I can't pass this up.

98
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:45,894
She looks like Marilyn Monroe.

99
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:50,273
I'm already in bed. And I took a sleeping
pill. So I'm afraid the answer is no.

100
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:54,951
We're doing the monthly efficiency rating.
I'm putting you in the top ten.

101
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:57,319
You don't wanna
louse yourself up, do you?

102
00:12:57,454 --> 00:13:02,200
No. But how can I be efficient in the
office if I don't get enough sleep at night?

103
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:06,463
It's only eleven, and I just
want the place for 45 minutes.

104
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:11,634
I'm getting lonely.
Who are you talking to, anyway?

105
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:15,759
- My mother.
- Oh, that's sweet. That's real sweet.

106
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:18,015
Ooh!

107
00:13:19,394 --> 00:13:22,229
Make it 30 minutes.
What do you say, Bud, huh?

108
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:26,148
I'm all out of liquor,
there's no clean glasses...

109
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:29,941
- There's no cheese crackers. No nothin'.
- Let me worry about that.

110
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:32,907
Just leave the key under the mat
and clear out.

111
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:35,073
Yes, Mr Dobisch.

112
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:38,658
Anything you say, Mr Dobisch!

113
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:43,247
No trouble at all, Mr Dobisch!
Be my guest!

114
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:47,082
We never close at Buddy-boy's.

115
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:52,883
"Looks like Marilyn Monroe"!

116
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:39,267
- This the place?
- Yeah.

117
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:41,351
- How much?
- 70 cents.

118
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,519
Get the money, will you?

119
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:47,273
Watch those stingers!

120
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,694
- Give him a buck.
- Thanks, lady.

121
00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:54,656
Put it back, honey!

122
00:14:56,621 --> 00:14:58,578
Attagirl.

123
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:01,873
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Can't think of a better one.

124
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,290
Barging in on your mother so late at night.

125
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,047
Don't worry about the old lady. One
squawk from her and she's out of a job.

126
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,190
Get the key, will you?

127
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:30,150
Not there! Under the mat.

128
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:32,986
- Under the mat?
- Yeah. Come on.

129
00:15:33,743 --> 00:15:36,198
Open up. We haven't got all night.

130
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:43,123
- This is your mother's apartment?
- That's right.

131
00:15:56,892 --> 00:15:59,383
Mildred! He's at it again!

132
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:51,980
- Morning, Mr Kirkeby.
- How are you, Baxter?

133
00:16:52,116 --> 00:16:56,031
- They keeping you busy these days?
- Yes, sir. They are indeed.

134
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:59,827
Good morning, Mr Kessel, Miss Robinson,
Mr Williams, Miss Livingston.

135
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,793
Good morning, Mr McKellway,
Mrs Schubert, Mr Davis.

136
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,624
Good morning, Mr Kirkeby.
Good morning, Mr Baxter.

137
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:08,591
- Morning, Miss Kubelik.
- That's all. Take it away.

138
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:11,173
Watch the door, please. Blasting off.

139
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:18,098
- What did you do to your hair?
- It made me nervous so I chopped it off.

140
00:17:18,227 --> 00:17:21,513
- Big mistake, huh?
- No. I sort of like it.

141
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:24,352
- You got a lulu.
- Yeah. Better not get too close.

142
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:26,393
- I never catch colds.
- Really?

143
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,362
I was reading some sickness
and accident claims figures.

144
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:34,115
The average New Yorker aged between
20 and 50 has two and a half colds a year.

145
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:36,699
- That makes me feel just terrible.
- Why?

146
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,077
If I have no colds a year, some poor slob
must have five colds a year.

147
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:44,792
- Yeah. It's me.
- You shoulda stayed in bed this morning.

148
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:47,377
I shoulda stayed in bed last night.

149
00:17:48,175 --> 00:17:49,717
19!

150
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,680
Watch your step.

151
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,380
- And watch your hands, Mr Kirkeby!
- Pardon?

152
00:17:57,518 --> 00:18:01,017
One of these days I'm gonna
shut these doors on you and...

153
00:18:03,274 --> 00:18:05,017
20 next!

154
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:09,477
<i>That Kubelik. Boy, would I like
to get her on a slow elevator to China!</i>

155
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:13,197
- She's the best operator in the building.
- I'm pretty good myself.

156
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,411
- But she won't give me a date.
- Maybe it's your approach.

157
00:18:16,538 --> 00:18:20,322
A lot of guys around here have tried
all kinds of approaches. No dice.

158
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:24,622
- What's she trying to prove?
- She could just be a nice respectable girl.

159
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:27,246
Listen to him! Little Lord Fauntleroy.

160
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:56,573
Hello. Mr Dobisch?
This is Baxter on the 19th floor.

161
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:58,448
Oh, Buddy-boy!

162
00:18:58,582 --> 00:19:03,540
I was just about to call you. I'm sorry
about that mess on the living room wall.

163
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,834
My friend kept insisting Picasso was
a bum, so she started to do that mural.

164
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:10,422
It's not Picasso I'm calling about.

165
00:19:10,553 --> 00:19:15,215
It's the key to my apartment.
You're supposed to leave it under the mat.

166
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:18,517
But I did. I distinctly
remember putting it there.

167
00:19:18,728 --> 00:19:21,729
Oh, I found the key all right.
Only it's the wrong key!

168
00:19:22,273 --> 00:19:28,109
It is? No wonder I couldn't get into
the executive washroom this morning.

169
00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:30,693
And I couldn't get into my apartment!

170
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:34,774
So at 4am I gotta wake up the landlady
and give her a whole song and dance.

171
00:19:34,911 --> 00:19:38,162
That's a shame.
I'll send the key right down.

172
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,247
And about your promotion.

173
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,579
I'll send that efficiency report
to Mr Sheldrake in Personnel.

174
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:46,168
You may hear from him
before the day's over.

175
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:48,338
Thank you, Mr Dobisch.

176
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:17,321
From Mr Dobisch.

177
00:20:17,456 --> 00:20:19,495
Wait.

178
00:20:30,177 --> 00:20:32,217
For Mr Dobisch.

179
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,976
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

180
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:57,531
Vanderhof. Public Relations.

181
00:20:57,664 --> 00:20:59,704
Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.

182
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,119
All right, Miss Finch.
Type up what we got so far.

183
00:21:05,673 --> 00:21:08,045
Look, I've got you down for tonight...

184
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:11,509
...but I'll be using the place myself,
so I'll have to cancel.

185
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,508
But it's her birthday.
I already ordered the cake.

186
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:19,801
But I am sick. I got a terrible cold and a
fever. I got to go to bed right after work.

187
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:23,686
If you got a cold, you go to a Turkish bath.
Spend the night. Sweat it out.

188
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:27,981
That's how you get pneumonia. If I got
pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month.

189
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:32,526
OK. You made your point. We'll just
have to do it next Wednesday night.

190
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:38,246
- It's the only night I can get away.
- Wednesday, Wednesday... Wednesday.

191
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:42,164
I got somebody pencilled in.

192
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:45,165
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

193
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:59,645
- Mr Eichelberger.
- Oh, yes, Baxter. What's your problem?

194
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:06,606
Wednesday is out? Oh, that throws
a little monkey wrench into my agenda.

195
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:10,022
Thursday? No,
I'm all tied up on Thursday.

196
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:14,658
Let's schedule that, uh...
meeting for Friday.

197
00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:16,826
Friday.

198
00:22:17,748 --> 00:22:20,500
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

199
00:22:26,174 --> 00:22:31,085
Premiumwise and billingwise, we are 18
per cent ahead of last year Octoberwise.

200
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:36,891
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?

201
00:22:37,018 --> 00:22:40,269
Instead of Friday, could you
possibly switch to Thursday?

202
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:43,184
You'd be doing me a great favour.

203
00:22:43,608 --> 00:22:46,064
Let me check. I'll get back to you.

204
00:22:47,821 --> 00:22:50,359
Consolidated Life. I'll connect you.

205
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:52,448
Sylvia, it's for you.

206
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:54,368
Yeah?

207
00:22:54,495 --> 00:22:56,155
Oh, hello.

208
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:59,622
Sure I got home all right.
You owe me 45 cents.

209
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,451
Look, Sylvia. Instead of Friday,
could we make it Thursday night?

210
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:08,832
<i>Thursday?! Well, that's
The Untouchables with Bob Stack!</i>

211
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:11,216
Bob who?

212
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,380
All right, so we'll watch it
at the apartment. Big deal!

213
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:22,184
Hello, Baxter? It's OK for Thursday.

214
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:24,897
Thank you, Mr Kirkeby.

215
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:37,027
Mr Eichelberger, it's OK for Friday.

216
00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:47,418
Mr Vanderhof? OK for Wednesday.

217
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,263
All right. I'll tell him.

218
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:04,229
Hey, Baxter, that was Personnel.
Mr Sheldrake's secretary.

219
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,318
She's been trying to reach you for the last
20 minutes. They want you upstairs.

220
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:15,075
- Are you getting promoted? Or fired?
- Would you care to make a small wager?

221
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:19,416
- I've been here twice as long as you but...
- Let's say a dollar?

222
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,120
It's a bet!

223
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:36,591
- Going up?
- Oh! Excuse me.

224
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:42,812
27, please. Drive carefully. You're carrying
precious cargo. I mean manpowerwise.

225
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,432
27.

226
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:48,518
You may not realise it, but I am
in the top ten, efficiencywise...

227
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:51,443
...and this may be the day promotionwise.

228
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:54,245
You're beginning to sound
like Mr Kirkeby already.

229
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:58,415
- Why not, as they're kicking me upstairs?
- Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

230
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:02,242
You know, you're the only one
who takes his hat off in the elevator.

231
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:04,667
Something happens to men in elevators.

232
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:07,799
It's the change of altitude.
The blood rushes to their head.

233
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:11,129
- I could tell you stories...
- I'd love to hear 'em.

234
00:25:11,263 --> 00:25:13,836
We could have lunch
in the cafeteria sometime.

235
00:25:13,974 --> 00:25:15,931
Or some evening, after work?

236
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:18,218
- 27.
- Oh.

237
00:25:18,354 --> 00:25:21,023
- I hope everything goes all right.
- I hope so.

238
00:25:21,148 --> 00:25:23,900
<i>They would call me today,
what with my cold.</i>

239
00:25:24,026 --> 00:25:26,482
- How do I look?
- Fine. Wait.

240
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:28,941
Thank you.

241
00:25:29,073 --> 00:25:33,901
I noticed, when you were still on the
local elevator, you always wore a flower.

242
00:25:34,037 --> 00:25:36,528
Good luck. And wipe your nose.

243
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:55,715
CC Baxter, Ordinary Premium Accounting.
Mr Sheldrake called me.

244
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:58,638
I called you. That is,
I tried to for 20 minutes.

245
00:25:58,771 --> 00:26:00,810
- I'm sorry.
- Go on in.

246
00:26:12,535 --> 00:26:14,113
- Baxter?
- Yes, sir.

247
00:26:14,245 --> 00:26:16,285
Come in, come in.

248
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:20,203
I was sort of wondering
what you looked like, Baxter.

249
00:26:20,335 --> 00:26:22,826
- Sit down.
- Yes, Mr Sheldrake.

250
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:27,091
Been hearing some nice things about you.

251
00:26:27,217 --> 00:26:30,302
Mr Dobisch says you're loyal,
cooperative, resourceful.

252
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:34,806
- Mr Dobisch said that?
- Mr Kirkeby tells me you often work late...

253
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:38,219
...without overtime.
- You know how it is. Things pile up.

254
00:26:38,938 --> 00:26:42,556
Mr Vanderhof in Public Relations and
Mr Eichelberger in Mortgage and Loans...

255
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:45,609
...would both like you
transferred to their departments.

256
00:26:45,736 --> 00:26:47,646
Very flattering.

257
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,987
Tell me, Baxter. Just what is it
that makes you so popular?

258
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:56,535
- I don't know.
- Think.

259
00:27:01,795 --> 00:27:05,840
- Would you mind repeating the question?
- Look, Baxter. I'm not stupid.

260
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:10,545
I know everything that goes on
in this building every day of the year.

261
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,138
You do?

262
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:16,807
In 1957 we had an employee here,
name of Fowler. He was very popular too.

263
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:19,641
It turned out
he was running a bookie joint...

264
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:23,307
...tying up our switchboard, using
our IBM machines to figure the odds.

265
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:27,737
The day before the Kentucky Derby I
called in the vice squad, who raided him.

266
00:27:27,864 --> 00:27:29,903
- The vice squad?
- That's right.

267
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:33,318
What's that got to do with me?
I'm not running any bookie joint.

268
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:36,952
- Just what kind of joint are you running?
- Sir?

269
00:27:37,082 --> 00:27:42,159
A key is floating around from Kirkeby
to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch.

270
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:44,288
It's the key to a certain apartment.

271
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:47,839
- Know who that apartment belongs to?
- Who?

272
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:51,338
Loyal, resourceful, cooperative CC Baxter.

273
00:27:53,891 --> 00:27:56,347
- Oh.
- Are you going to deny it?

274
00:27:57,478 --> 00:28:01,310
No. I'm not going to deny it.
If you'd just let me explain.

275
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:03,810
You'd better.

276
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:05,983
Well...

277
00:28:06,654 --> 00:28:11,447
...about a year ago, I was going to night
school, studying advanced accounting.

278
00:28:11,576 --> 00:28:16,571
One of the guys in our department - lives
in Jersey - had to go to a banquet in town.

279
00:28:16,707 --> 00:28:21,119
He needed someplace to change
into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key.

280
00:28:21,253 --> 00:28:27,208
Word must've gotten out because all sorts
of guys were suddenly going to banquets.

281
00:28:27,343 --> 00:28:32,219
You give the key to one guy, you can't
say no to another. It all got out of hand.

282
00:28:35,226 --> 00:28:38,642
Baxter, an insurance company
is founded on public trust.

283
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:42,057
Any employee who conducts himself
in a manner unbecoming...

284
00:28:42,191 --> 00:28:45,228
How many charter members
are there in this little club?

285
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:49,146
Just those four. Out of a total of 31,259.

286
00:28:49,282 --> 00:28:53,363
So actually we can be very proud
of our personnel... percentagewise.

287
00:28:53,495 --> 00:28:58,157
That's not the point. Four rotten apples
in a barrel, however large the barrel...

288
00:28:58,292 --> 00:29:01,495
- Do you realise if this ever leaked out...
- It won't!

289
00:29:01,628 --> 00:29:06,623
Believe me. Never again. Nobody
is gonna use my apartment from now on.

290
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:09,428
- Where is your apartment?
- West 67th Street.

291
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:15,058
You have no idea what I go through with
the neighbours, the landlady and the key.

292
00:29:15,184 --> 00:29:17,224
How do you work it with the key?

293
00:29:17,353 --> 00:29:22,229
I slip it to 'em in the office and they leave
it under a mat. Never again. I promise.

294
00:29:25,946 --> 00:29:29,860
- Yes, Miss Olsen?
- Mrs Sheldrake, returning your call. On 2.

295
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:36,494
<i>Yes, dear. Where were you?</i>

296
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:42,083
You had to take Tommy to the dentist?
No cavities? Good. Hold it, dear.

297
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:45,249
- Where are you going, Baxter?
- I don't wanna intrude.

298
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:48,716
- Since this is straightened out...
- I'm not through with you yet.

299
00:29:48,844 --> 00:29:51,051
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

300
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,178
The branch manager from Kansas City
is in town. I'm taking him to the theatre.

301
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,136
<i>Music Man. What else?</i>

302
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,808
No, don't wait up for me,
darling. Goodbye.

303
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:04,440
<i>Tell me, Baxter.
Have you seen Music Man?</i>

304
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,191
Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.

305
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:09,564
How would you like to go tonight?

306
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,994
You and me? I thought you were taking
the branch manager from Kansas City.

307
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:17,407
No, I have other plans.
You can have both tickets.

308
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,581
Well... that's very kind of you.

309
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:23,755
But I'm not feeling well. I've got
this cold. I'm gonna go right home.

310
00:30:23,881 --> 00:30:27,464
Baxter, you're not reading me.
I told you I have plans.

311
00:30:27,885 --> 00:30:31,089
So do I. I'm gonna take
four aspirins, get into bed.

312
00:30:31,222 --> 00:30:33,464
So give the tickets to somebody else.

313
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:38,554
Look, Baxter. I'm not just giving
these tickets. I wanna swap them.

314
00:30:38,688 --> 00:30:40,847
Swap 'em? For what?

315
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:47,979
It also says here that you are
alert, astute and quite imaginative.

316
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:51,150
Oh?

317
00:30:56,207 --> 00:30:58,246
Oh...

318
00:31:07,677 --> 00:31:11,805
That's good thinking, Baxter. There's
gonna be a shift in personnel next month.

319
00:31:11,931 --> 00:31:15,799
And as far as I'm concerned,
you are executive material.

320
00:31:15,935 --> 00:31:18,391
- I am?
- Now put down the key.

321
00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:23,606
And put down the address.

322
00:31:25,612 --> 00:31:30,773
It's on the second floor. There's no name
over the door. It just says apartment 2A.

323
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,736
- It's that cold.
- Relax, Baxter.

324
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:35,911
Yes, thank you, sir.

325
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:41,043
You will be careful with
the record player? Shh.

326
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,210
Oh, and about the liquor.

327
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:47,918
I ordered some this morning.
I don't know when they'll deliver it.

328
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,006
- This is going to be our little secret.
- Of course.

329
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,809
- You know how people talk.
- Don't worry about that.

330
00:31:54,935 --> 00:31:58,683
- Not that I have anything to hide.
- No! Anyway, it's none of my business.

331
00:31:58,814 --> 00:32:02,681
Four apples, five apples.
What's the difference?

332
00:32:02,818 --> 00:32:04,857
Percentagewise.

333
00:32:04,987 --> 00:32:07,560
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.

334
00:32:07,698 --> 00:32:09,738
You too, sir.

335
00:32:41,775 --> 00:32:45,725
So I figure, a man in his position,
he'll take me to El Morocco, maybe 21.

336
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:50,406
Instead he takes me to Hamburger
Heaven and some schnook's apartment.

337
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,412
- Good night.
- Good night.

338
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:01,791
Oh! Miss Kubelik?

339
00:33:01,921 --> 00:33:05,088
I've been waiting for you.
I almost didn't recognise you.

340
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:08,383
This is the first time
I've seen you in civilian clothes.

341
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:10,800
- How'd it go on the 27th floor?
- Great.

342
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:13,338
<i>- Look, have you seen The Music Man?
- No.</i>

343
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:15,100
- Would you like to?
- Sure.

344
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:17,552
We could get a bite to eat first,
and then go.

345
00:33:17,688 --> 00:33:19,265
- Oh, you mean tonight?
- Yeah.

346
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:22,482
- I'm sorry, I can't. I'm meeting somebody.
- Oh.

347
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,192
- You mean... like a girlfriend?
- No. Like a man.

348
00:33:26,322 --> 00:33:30,900
I wasn't trying to be personal. The fellas
in the office were wondering if you ever...

349
00:33:31,035 --> 00:33:32,992
You tell 'em now and then.

350
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,450
This date, is it... just a date?
Or is it something serious?

351
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:41,035
<i>Well, it used to be serious.
At least, I was. But he wasn't.</i>

352
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:43,543
So now the whole thing's
more or less kaput.

353
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:46,295
- In that case, couldn't you...
- I'm afraid not.

354
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:50,554
I promised I'd have a drink with him.
He's been calling me all week.

355
00:33:51,223 --> 00:33:53,465
I understand.

356
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,144
Well, it was just an idea. I hate
to see a theatre ticket go to waste.

357
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,356
- What time does the show go on?
- 8.30.

358
00:34:01,483 --> 00:34:03,856
Well, I could meet you at the theatre.

359
00:34:03,986 --> 00:34:08,066
That's wonderful!
It's the Majestic on 44th Street.

360
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,073
I'll meet you in the lobby.

361
00:34:10,201 --> 00:34:13,700
You know, I felt so lousy
this morning. Had 101 fever.

362
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:17,329
Now along comes my promotion
and us - 11th row centre.

363
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,416
And you said I should've stayed in bed.

364
00:34:19,544 --> 00:34:21,702
- How is your cold?
- What cold?

365
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,883
After the show we could go out
on the town.

366
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:28,796
- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
- So I see.

367
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:31,930
There's a great band
at El Chico, in the Village.

368
00:34:32,057 --> 00:34:35,592
- Around the corner from where you live.
- Sounds good.

369
00:34:35,728 --> 00:34:40,354
- How do you know where I live?
- Oh, I... even know who you live with.

370
00:34:40,483 --> 00:34:42,522
Your sister and brother-in-law.

371
00:34:42,651 --> 00:34:46,601
I know when you were born and where.
I know all sorts of things about you.

372
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,150
How come?

373
00:34:48,282 --> 00:34:52,991
A couple of months ago I looked up
your card in the group insurance file.

374
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:57,035
I know your height and your weight
and your social security number.

375
00:34:57,167 --> 00:35:01,081
You had mumps and measles
and you had your appendix out.

376
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:05,214
Don't mention the appendix
to the fellas in the office.

377
00:35:05,342 --> 00:35:10,087
I wouldn't want 'em to get the wrong idea
about how you found out. Bye.

378
00:35:13,434 --> 00:35:15,473
8.30!

379
00:35:50,806 --> 00:35:53,890
<i>(¶ "Jealous Lover")</i>

380
00:36:04,404 --> 00:36:08,484
- Good evening, Mr Sheldrake.
- Please, Fran. Not so loud.

381
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:11,072
Still afraid someone
might see us together?

382
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:14,821
- Let me take your coat.
- No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.

383
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:19,369
- Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
- It's on the way.

384
00:36:20,462 --> 00:36:23,914
- I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
- That's right.

385
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:27,383
- You know I liked it better long.
- I know.

386
00:36:27,511 --> 00:36:30,382
You want a lock to carry in your wallet?

387
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,675
- Evening, lady. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

388
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:38,100
How long has it been, Fran? A month?

389
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:40,900
Six weeks. But who's counting?

390
00:36:41,984 --> 00:36:44,024
I missed you.

391
00:36:46,573 --> 00:36:48,612
Like old times.

392
00:36:48,742 --> 00:36:51,446
Same booth. Same song.

393
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:56,457
- It's been hell.
- Same sauce. Sweet-and-sour.

394
00:36:59,002 --> 00:37:02,206
You don't know what it's like,
next to you in that elevator.

395
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:05,542
"Good morning, Miss Kubelik."
"Good night, Mr Sheldrake."

396
00:37:05,676 --> 00:37:08,214
I'm still crazy about you, Fran.

397
00:37:08,345 --> 00:37:13,850
Let's not start on that again, Jeff. Please?
I'm just beginning to get over it.

398
00:37:15,186 --> 00:37:17,642
I don't believe you.

399
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:21,857
Look, Jeff. We had two
wonderful months this summer.

400
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:24,855
But that was it. Happens all the time.

401
00:37:24,988 --> 00:37:29,116
Wife and kids go away to the country and
the boss has a fling with his secretary...

402
00:37:29,242 --> 00:37:31,994
...or the manicurist, or the elevator girl.

403
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,536
Come September,
the picnic's over. Goodbye.

404
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:39,710
The kids go back to school,
the boss goes back to the wife...

405
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:41,876
...and the girl...

406
00:37:43,215 --> 00:37:46,216
They don't make these shrimp
like they used to.

407
00:37:49,388 --> 00:37:52,058
I never said goodbye, Fran.

408
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:58,975
For a while there, you try kidding yourself
that you're going with an unmarried man.

409
00:37:59,107 --> 00:38:01,894
Then one day he keeps
looking at his watch...

410
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:04,648
...and asks you if any lipstick's showing...

411
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:08,279
...then rushes out to catch
the 7.14 to White Plains.

412
00:38:09,493 --> 00:38:13,076
So you fix yourself
a cup of instant coffee...

413
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:16,954
...and you sit there
by yourself and you think...

414
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,246
...and it all begins to look so... ugly.

415
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:28,591
How do you think I felt
riding home on that 7.14 train?

416
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:32,933
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?
What do you want from me?

417
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:35,099
I want you back, Fran.

418
00:38:35,228 --> 00:38:39,142
Sorry, Mr Sheldrake. I'm full up.
You'll have to take the next elevator.

419
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:43,188
You're not giving me a chance, Fran.
I have something to tell you.

420
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,187
- Go ahead. Tell me.
- Not here. Can't we go someplace else?

421
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:50,159
- No. I have a date at 8.30.
- Oh?

422
00:38:50,535 --> 00:38:54,368
- Important?
- Not very, but I'm gonna be there anyway.

423
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,167
- You ready order dinner now?
- No. No dinner.

424
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,784
Just bring us two more drinks, will you?

425
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:22,603
Fran, do you remember
that last weekend we had?

426
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:27,612
Do I! That leaky boat you rented, and me
in a black negligee and a life preserver.

427
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:30,113
Do you remember what we talked about?

428
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:33,862
- We talked about a lot of things.
- I mean about my getting a divorce.

429
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:36,370
<i>We didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.</i>

430
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,540
You didn't believe me, did you?

431
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:43,130
They got it on a long-playing record now.
"Music to String Her Along By."

432
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:48,085
"My wife doesn't understand me. You're
the best thing that ever happened to me."

433
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:51,554
- That's enough, Fran.
- "Trust me, baby. We'll work it out."

434
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:54,388
- You're not being funny.
- I wasn't trying.

435
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:58,934
- Fran, just listen to me for a minute.
- All right. I'm sorry.

436
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:04,143
I saw my lawyer this morning. I wanted
his advice about the best way to handle it.

437
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:06,735
- Handle what?
- What do you think?

438
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,696
Let's get something straight, Jeff.
I never asked you to leave your wife.

439
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,582
Of course not. You had
nothing to do with it.

440
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:19,708
Are you sure that's what you want?

441
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:24,373
I'm sure... if you'll just tell me
that you still love me.

442
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:29,635
You know I do.

443
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:34,434
Fran.

444
00:40:38,106 --> 00:40:40,146
Jeff, darling...

445
00:40:46,573 --> 00:40:49,658
It is getting crowded. Let's get out of here.

446
00:40:57,919 --> 00:41:01,003
<i>(¶ "Jealous Lover")</i>

447
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:23,611
Taxi!

448
00:41:23,737 --> 00:41:27,320
- Jeff, I have that date, remember?
- But I love you, remember?

449
00:41:27,449 --> 00:41:30,071
- Where are we going?

450
00:41:30,202 --> 00:41:32,990
- Not back to that leaky boat?
- I promise.

451
00:41:37,543 --> 00:41:39,999
51 West 67th.

452
00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:25,089
Congratulations.

453
00:42:40,484 --> 00:42:43,485
Would you mind? CC Baxter - that's me.

454
00:42:46,991 --> 00:42:49,031
Thank you.

455
00:43:04,301 --> 00:43:07,800
Hi, Buddy-boy.
Congratulations and all that jazz.

456
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:11,429
- Hi, fellas.
- Well, you made it, just like we promised.

457
00:43:11,558 --> 00:43:14,762
Quite an office.
Name on the door, rug on the floor.

458
00:43:14,895 --> 00:43:19,604
Teamwork: That's what counts in this
organisation. All for one and one for all.

459
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:21,773
- Know what I mean?
- I have a vague idea.

460
00:43:21,902 --> 00:43:25,069
Baxter, we're a little disappointed
in you, gratitudewise.

461
00:43:25,197 --> 00:43:28,649
- Oh, I'm very grateful.
- Then why are you locking us out?

462
00:43:28,785 --> 00:43:34,408
Well, it's been sort of rough the past few
weeks, what with my cold and... like that.

463
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:37,376
We went to bat for you.
Now you won't play ball with us.

464
00:43:37,502 --> 00:43:41,832
After all, it's my apartment. It's
private property, not a public playground.

465
00:43:41,965 --> 00:43:46,212
So you got yourself a girl. That's OK
with us. But not every night in the week!

466
00:43:46,345 --> 00:43:48,088
How selfish can you get?

467
00:43:48,222 --> 00:43:52,006
Last week I had to use my nephew's car
and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.

468
00:43:52,142 --> 00:43:55,179
I'm too old for that sort of thing -
I mean in a Volkswagen.

469
00:43:55,312 --> 00:43:58,563
I sympathise with you.
Believe me, I'm very sorry.

470
00:43:58,691 --> 00:44:02,024
- You'll be a lot sorrier.
- Are you threatening me?

471
00:44:02,153 --> 00:44:05,237
Listen, Baxter. We made you
and we can break you.

472
00:44:06,491 --> 00:44:09,408
- Good morning, Mr Sheldrake.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

473
00:44:09,535 --> 00:44:13,664
- Baxter, do you like your office?
- Yes, sir. I wanna thank you very much.

474
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,708
Don't thank me.
Your friends here recommended you.

475
00:44:16,835 --> 00:44:20,619
- We just dropped by to wish him luck.
- We know you won't let us down.

476
00:44:20,756 --> 00:44:25,501
So long, fellas. Drop in any time.
The door is always open... to my office.

477
00:44:26,386 --> 00:44:28,463
I like the way you handled that, Baxter.

478
00:44:28,597 --> 00:44:31,171
- How does it feel to be an executive?
- Oh, fine.

479
00:44:31,308 --> 00:44:35,140
- I'll work hard to justify your confidence.
- I'm sure you will.

480
00:44:35,271 --> 00:44:40,063
About the apartment. Now that you've got
a raise, can't we afford a second key?

481
00:44:40,192 --> 00:44:42,600
- I guess so.
- You know my secretary, Miss Olsen?

482
00:44:42,737 --> 00:44:45,524
- Oh, yeah. Is she the lucky girl that...?
- Oh, no, no.

483
00:44:45,657 --> 00:44:50,947
I just meant that she's kind of a busybody,
and passing that key back and forth...

484
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:53,700
- Why take chances?
- You can't be too careful.

485
00:44:53,832 --> 00:44:56,868
Oh, I... have something
I think belongs to you.

486
00:44:57,002 --> 00:44:59,540
- Me?
- I mean the young lady, whoever she is.

487
00:44:59,671 --> 00:45:02,423
- I found it when I got back last night.
- Oh. Thanks.

488
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:06,049
The mirror is broken.
It was broken when I found it.

489
00:45:07,763 --> 00:45:10,598
- Yeah. She threw it at me.
- Sir?

490
00:45:10,724 --> 00:45:13,216
You know how it is.
They always give you a bad time.

491
00:45:13,352 --> 00:45:14,431
Yeah, I know how it is.

492
00:45:14,562 --> 00:45:19,307
You see a girl every week for laughs and
they think you're gonna divorce your wife.

493
00:45:19,442 --> 00:45:22,645
- Now I ask you, is that fair?
- No, sir. It's very unfair.

494
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:24,771
- Especially to your wife.
- Yeah.

495
00:45:25,198 --> 00:45:29,777
You know, Baxter, I envy you. A bachelor,
all the dames you want, no complications.

496
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:31,489
That's the life all right.

497
00:45:31,621 --> 00:45:33,910
- Put me down for Thursday again.
- Roger.

498
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,282
And I'll get that other key.

499
00:45:48,514 --> 00:45:52,381
- Merry Christmas. I'll connect you.
- Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.

500
00:45:52,518 --> 00:45:54,511
Merry Christmas. I'm ringing.

501
00:45:54,645 --> 00:45:56,685
Yeah? Yeah?!

502
00:45:56,814 --> 00:45:57,929
Where?

503
00:45:58,066 --> 00:45:59,311
You bet!

504
00:45:59,442 --> 00:46:03,771
Somebody watch my line. There's
a swingin' party on the 19th floor!

505
00:46:06,116 --> 00:46:09,117
<i>¶ Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

506
00:46:09,244 --> 00:46:12,993
<i>¶ Hey! Jingle bells,
jingle bells, jingle all the way</i>

507
00:46:13,123 --> 00:46:16,409
<i>¶ Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

508
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:37,981
So I said to him "Never again. Either you
get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl."

509
00:46:38,858 --> 00:46:40,898
Miss Kubelik? Miss...

510
00:46:41,152 --> 00:46:43,359
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

511
00:46:43,488 --> 00:46:46,572
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- What gave you that idea?

512
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,484
In six weeks you've only been in my
elevator once, and you kept on your hat.

513
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:54,072
As a matter of fact, I was rather hurt
that night you stood me up.

514
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:56,247
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.

515
00:46:56,376 --> 00:46:58,001
- I forgive you.
- You shouldn't.

516
00:46:58,128 --> 00:47:01,628
You couldn't help it. You can't
suddenly walk out on one man...

517
00:47:01,757 --> 00:47:03,999
...because you have a date
with another man.

518
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:06,507
- You did the decent thing.
- Don't be too sure.

519
00:47:06,637 --> 00:47:10,137
Just because I wear a uniform,
that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.

520
00:47:10,266 --> 00:47:15,012
A second administrative assistant has
to be a pretty good judge of character.

521
00:47:15,146 --> 00:47:17,637
And as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.

522
00:47:17,774 --> 00:47:22,483
I mean decencywise and... otherwisewise.

523
00:47:22,612 --> 00:47:24,652
Cheers.

524
00:47:26,408 --> 00:47:28,733
- One more.
- I shouldn't drink while driving.

525
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:33,994
You're so right. By the power vested
in me, I declare this elevator out of order.

526
00:47:34,124 --> 00:47:36,497
Shall we join the natives?

527
00:47:36,627 --> 00:47:40,162
- Why not? They seem friendly enough.
- Don't you believe it.

528
00:47:40,297 --> 00:47:44,426
There'll be human sacrifices. White-collar
workers tossed into computers...

529
00:47:44,552 --> 00:47:46,794
...and punched full of little square holes.

530
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:49,136
- How many drinks did you have?
- Three!

531
00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:52,468
- I thought so.
- Wait. I hear the sound of running water.

532
00:47:52,602 --> 00:47:55,175
- I'll be right back!
- I'll be right here.

533
00:47:56,648 --> 00:47:58,308
Hi!

534
00:47:58,441 --> 00:48:01,063
How's the branch manager
from Kansas City?

535
00:48:01,194 --> 00:48:02,902
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm Miss Olsen.

536
00:48:03,029 --> 00:48:04,987
Mr Sheldrake's secretary.

537
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,487
So you don't have to
play innocent with me.

538
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:11,662
He used to tell his wife
I was the branch manager from Seattle...

539
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:16,036
...four years ago when we were having
a little ring-a-ding-ding.

540
00:48:17,002 --> 00:48:21,131
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Before me it was Miss Rossi in Auditing.

541
00:48:21,257 --> 00:48:23,926
And after me it was
Miss Koch in Disability.

542
00:48:24,051 --> 00:48:26,424
And right before you was a Miss, um...

543
00:48:26,554 --> 00:48:28,926
Oh, what's her name? On the 25th floor.

544
00:48:29,057 --> 00:48:32,640
- Would you excuse me?
- What for? You haven't done anything.

545
00:48:32,852 --> 00:48:35,972
It's him. Oh, what a salesman!

546
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:38,937
Always the last booth
in the Chinese restaurant...

547
00:48:39,067 --> 00:48:42,152
...and the same pitch
about divorcing his wife.

548
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:48,742
Then, in the end, you wind up
with egg foo yung on your face.

549
00:48:48,869 --> 00:48:50,909
Miss Kubelik!

550
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:54,790
Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.

551
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:59,045
Always happy to do a little something
for our girls in uniform.

552
00:49:00,256 --> 00:49:02,414
Are you all right? What's the matter?

553
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,123
Nothing. There are just
too many people here.

554
00:49:05,261 --> 00:49:09,211
Why don't we step into my office? There's
something I want your opinion about.

555
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:14,141
I have my own office now. I'm the second
youngest executive in this company.

556
00:49:14,271 --> 00:49:17,971
The only one younger is a grandson
of the chairman of the board.

557
00:49:19,234 --> 00:49:21,274
Do you mind?

558
00:49:25,491 --> 00:49:28,990
Miss Kubelik, I would like
your honest opinion.

559
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,405
I've had this under my desk
for a week. It cost me $15.

560
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,825
I haven't been able
to get up enough nerve to wear it.

561
00:49:41,507 --> 00:49:46,466
It's what they call the Junior Executive
model. What do you think?

562
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:52,845
I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?

563
00:49:52,978 --> 00:49:55,220
- I like it.
- Really?

564
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:58,273
You wouldn't be ashamed to be seen
with somebody in this hat?

565
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,398
- Of course not.
- Maybe if I wore it a little to one side.

566
00:50:02,529 --> 00:50:05,281
- Is that better?
- Much better.

567
00:50:05,407 --> 00:50:08,112
Since you wouldn't be
ashamed to be seen with me...

568
00:50:08,244 --> 00:50:11,364
...how about goin' out tonight -
you, me and the bowler?

569
00:50:11,497 --> 00:50:14,332
We'll stroll down 5th Avenue,
sort of break it in.

570
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:18,291
- This is a bad day for me.
- I understand. Christmas and family.

571
00:50:18,421 --> 00:50:20,829
I'd better get back to my elevator
or I'll be fired.

572
00:50:20,965 --> 00:50:24,797
Don't worry about that. I've got
quite a bit of influence with Personnel.

573
00:50:24,928 --> 00:50:26,967
You know Mr Sheldrake?

574
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:30,845
- Why?
- He and I are like that.

575
00:50:30,976 --> 00:50:33,645
Sent me a Christmas card. See?

576
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,111
Makes a cute picture.

577
00:50:43,072 --> 00:50:45,777
I could talk to Mr Sheldrake.
Get you a promotion.

578
00:50:45,908 --> 00:50:51,614
- Would you like to be an elevator starter?
- Too many girls have seniority over me.

579
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:55,124
No problem. Why don't we
discuss it over the holidays?

580
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:59,664
I could call you, pick you up, have
a big unveiling. Am I wearing this right?

581
00:50:59,797 --> 00:51:01,956
I think so. Here.

582
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:05,128
It's not tilted too much?
This is a conservative firm.

583
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:08,346
I don't want people
to think I'm an entertainer.

584
00:51:12,811 --> 00:51:14,851
What's the matter?

585
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:20,099
- The mirror. It's broken.
- Yes, I know.

586
00:51:21,195 --> 00:51:24,231
I like it that way.
Makes me look the way I feel.

587
00:51:28,536 --> 00:51:30,575
Your phone.

588
00:51:36,252 --> 00:51:38,292
Yes?

589
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,707
Uh, just a minute.

590
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,384
- If you don't mind, this is sort of personal.
- Have a nice Christmas.

591
00:51:52,144 --> 00:51:54,183
Yes, Mr Sheldrake.

592
00:51:55,272 --> 00:52:00,611
No, I didn't forget. The tree is up and the
Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator.

593
00:52:00,736 --> 00:52:02,776
Yes, sir. Same to you.

594
00:52:30,058 --> 00:52:32,550
Hey! Where are you goin', Buddy-boy?

595
00:52:32,686 --> 00:52:34,928
The party's just starting.

596
00:52:35,064 --> 00:52:38,480
Listen, kid. Gimme a break.
How about tomorrow afternoon?

597
00:52:38,609 --> 00:52:44,114
I can't take her to that drive-in again.
The car has no heater. Four o'clock. OK?

598
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:25,948
Hey, Charlie! Gimme a shot of bourbon,
and step on it! My sleigh is double-parked!

599
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:36,474
You buy me a drink,
I'll buy you some music.

600
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,647
Rum Collins.

601
00:54:48,787 --> 00:54:50,115
Uh...

602
00:54:50,247 --> 00:54:53,865
Rum Collins and...
another one of these little mothers.

603
00:54:57,462 --> 00:55:00,132
<i>(¶ "O Come, All Ye Faithful")</i>

604
00:55:06,013 --> 00:55:07,970
You like Castro?

605
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:10,934
I mean, how do you feel about Castro?

606
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,892
- What is Castro?
- You know. That big shot down in Cuba.

607
00:55:15,022 --> 00:55:17,181
- With the crazy beard.
- What about him?

608
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:20,602
Cos as far as I'm concerned,
he's a no-good fink.

609
00:55:20,737 --> 00:55:24,106
Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter.
Never even answered me.

610
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,236
That so?

611
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:29,199
All I wanted him to do was
let Mickey out for Christmas.

612
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:31,369
- Who's Mickey?
- My husband.

613
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:34,072
He's in Havana, in jail.

614
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:37,744
- Mixed up in that revolution?
- Mickey would do nothin' like that.

615
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,664
He's a jockey.
They caught him dopin' a horse.

616
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,042
Well, you can't win 'em all.

617
00:55:49,225 --> 00:55:52,890
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house

618
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:55,060
Not a creature was stirrin'...

619
00:55:55,857 --> 00:55:58,941
Nothin'. No action.

620
00:55:59,486 --> 00:56:01,395
Dullsville.

621
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:03,652
- You married?
- No.

622
00:56:03,782 --> 00:56:05,821
- Family?
- No.

623
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:11,203
A night like this, it sort of spooks you
to walk into an empty apartment.

624
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:16,919
I said I had no family. I didn't say
I had an empty apartment.

625
00:56:21,801 --> 00:56:24,256
Come on, Fran. Don't be that way.

626
00:56:24,971 --> 00:56:27,972
Are you just gonna
sit there and keep bawling?

627
00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:31,385
You won't talk to me?
You won't tell me what's wrong?

628
00:56:33,146 --> 00:56:38,223
I know you think I'm stalling you but...
when you've been married for 12 years...

629
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,938
...you just don't sit down to breakfast and
say "Pass the sugar. I want a divorce."

630
00:56:43,073 --> 00:56:45,646
It's not that easy.

631
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:51,738
Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids
are off school, my in-laws are visiting.

632
00:56:51,874 --> 00:56:53,913
I can't bring it up now.

633
00:56:55,711 --> 00:57:00,788
This isn't like you, Fran. You were always
such a good sport. Such fun to be with.

634
00:57:03,135 --> 00:57:07,513
That's me. The happy idiot.
A million laughs.

635
00:57:08,474 --> 00:57:12,722
Well, that's a little more like it.
At least you're speaking to me.

636
00:57:13,688 --> 00:57:17,140
A funny thing happened to me
at the office party today.

637
00:57:17,275 --> 00:57:19,731
I ran into your secretary, Miss Olsen.

638
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,777
You know. Ring-a-ding-ding?

639
00:57:23,865 --> 00:57:26,736
And I laughed so much, I like to died.

640
00:57:26,869 --> 00:57:31,495
Is that what's been bothering you, Fran?
Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.

641
00:57:31,624 --> 00:57:34,708
Well, I never was very good at history.

642
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:39,666
Let me see. There was Miss Olsen,
and then there was Miss Rossi.

643
00:57:39,799 --> 00:57:42,919
No, she came before.
Miss Koch came after Miss Olsen.

644
00:57:43,052 --> 00:57:45,460
- Now, Fran...
- And just think.

645
00:57:45,596 --> 00:57:49,464
Right now some lucky girl in the building
is gonna come after me.

646
00:57:49,601 --> 00:57:52,353
OK. OK, Fran. I guess I deserved that.

647
00:57:52,479 --> 00:57:56,607
But ask yourself: Why does a man
run around with a lot of girls?

648
00:57:56,733 --> 00:58:00,517
Because he's unhappy at home.
Because he's lonely. That's why.

649
00:58:00,654 --> 00:58:03,904
But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.

650
00:58:05,451 --> 00:58:09,579
How could I be so stupid?
You'd think I would've learned by now.

651
00:58:09,705 --> 00:58:14,248
When you're in love with a married man,
you shouldn't wear mascara.

652
00:58:15,002 --> 00:58:18,122
It's Christmas Eve, Fran.
Let's not fight, huh?

653
00:58:20,425 --> 00:58:22,880
- Merry Christmas.
- What is it?

654
00:58:28,391 --> 00:58:31,061
Oh. Our friend at the Chinese restaurant.

655
00:58:32,312 --> 00:58:37,603
- Thanks, Fran. We'd better keep it here.
- Yeah, we'd better.

656
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,483
Oh, I have a present for you.

657
00:58:40,612 --> 00:58:44,990
I didn't know what to get you. Besides,
it's kind of awkward for me shopping, so...

658
00:58:45,117 --> 00:58:48,617
Here's $100. You go
and buy yourself something.

659
00:58:53,584 --> 00:58:56,788
They have some nice
alligator bags at Bergdorf's.

660
00:59:08,558 --> 00:59:12,686
I didn't realise it was so late. It's quarter
to seven. I mustn't miss my train.

661
00:59:12,813 --> 00:59:17,356
If we hadn't wasted all this time...
I have to get home and trim the tree.

662
00:59:17,943 --> 00:59:21,811
OK. I just thought,
as long as it was paid for...

663
00:59:21,947 --> 00:59:24,070
Don't ever talk like that, Fran.

664
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:28,328
- Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
- $100? I don't call that cheap.

665
00:59:28,454 --> 00:59:32,582
And you must be paying somebody
something for the use of the apartment.

666
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:34,748
Stop it, Fran.

667
00:59:35,837 --> 00:59:37,876
You'll miss your train, Jeff.

668
00:59:46,515 --> 00:59:48,139
Are you coming?

669
00:59:48,266 --> 00:59:50,936
No, you run along. I'm gonna fix my face.

670
00:59:51,061 --> 00:59:53,599
Don't forget to kill the lights.
See you Monday.

671
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:57,313
Sure. Monday... and Thursday...

672
00:59:57,443 --> 01:00:00,693
...and Monday again, and Thursday again.

673
01:00:02,656 --> 01:00:05,574
It won't always be like this, Fran.

674
01:00:05,701 --> 01:00:07,860
I love you.

675
01:00:07,995 --> 01:00:10,237
Careful. Lipstick.

676
01:00:11,582 --> 01:00:13,622
Merry Christmas.

677
01:00:40,654 --> 01:00:42,694
<i>(¶ "Jealous Lover")</i>

678
01:02:40,238 --> 01:02:43,856
- Drink up, pop. It's closing time.
- But it's early, Charlie.

679
01:02:43,992 --> 01:02:47,575
- Don't you know what night this is?
- I know, Charlie. I know.

680
01:02:47,704 --> 01:02:49,743
I work for the outfit.

681
01:02:55,337 --> 01:02:58,089
Hey, knock it off, will ya? Go home.

682
01:03:06,307 --> 01:03:08,513
O-U-T. Out!

683
01:03:13,439 --> 01:03:16,109
Where'll we go? My place or yours?

684
01:03:18,736 --> 01:03:22,070
Might as well go to mine.
Everybody else does.

685
01:03:33,794 --> 01:03:39,168
Poor Mickey. When I think of him
all by himself in that jail in Havana...

686
01:03:39,299 --> 01:03:41,541
Would you like to see his picture?

687
01:03:41,677 --> 01:03:43,717
Not particularly.

688
01:03:45,097 --> 01:03:49,925
He's so cute. He's 5 foot 2, 99 pounds.

689
01:03:50,061 --> 01:03:52,100
Like a little Chihuahua.

690
01:04:04,909 --> 01:04:08,113
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.

691
01:04:08,246 --> 01:04:10,204
You got a girlfriend?

692
01:04:10,332 --> 01:04:13,203
She may be a girl
but she is no friend of mine.

693
01:04:13,335 --> 01:04:17,499
- Still stuck on her, huh?
- Obviously you don't know me very well.

694
01:04:17,673 --> 01:04:20,378
- I don't know you at all.
- Permit me.

695
01:04:20,843 --> 01:04:27,296
CC Baxter. Junior executive,
Arthur Murray graduate... lover.

696
01:04:27,433 --> 01:04:30,802
I'm Mrs MacDougall. Margie to you.

697
01:04:32,188 --> 01:04:34,228
This way, Mrs MacDougall.

698
01:04:44,701 --> 01:04:47,536
Say! This is snugsville!

699
01:04:47,663 --> 01:04:50,284
Mrs MacDougall,
it's only fair to warn you...

700
01:04:50,415 --> 01:04:53,785
...you are now alone
with a notorious sexpot.

701
01:04:53,919 --> 01:04:56,588
- No kiddin'!
- Ask anybody around here.

702
01:04:56,714 --> 01:05:00,794
As a matter of fact, when it's time for me
to go - and I may go just like that -

703
01:05:00,926 --> 01:05:03,844
I have promised my body
to the Columbia Medical Center.

704
01:05:03,971 --> 01:05:06,972
Gee! Sort of gives you goose bumps
just to think about it.

705
01:05:07,099 --> 01:05:10,385
They haven't got me yet, baby.
Dig up some ice from the kitchen.

706
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,437
Let's not waste any more time
preliminarywise.

707
01:05:13,565 --> 01:05:15,604
I'm with you, lover.

708
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:34,686
All right, Miss Kubelik. Get up.

709
01:06:35,483 --> 01:06:37,690
Come on. It's past checking-out time.

710
01:06:37,819 --> 01:06:42,197
The management would appreciate it
if you'd get the hell outta here.

711
01:06:44,993 --> 01:06:50,332
I used to like you. I used to like you a lot.
Well, it's all over between us, so beat it.

712
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,039
O-U-T, out!

713
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:56,251
Come on, wake up.

714
01:07:02,804 --> 01:07:04,843
Oh my God.

715
01:07:04,973 --> 01:07:07,012
Miss Kubelik?

716
01:07:07,726 --> 01:07:09,765
Miss Kubelik?

717
01:07:19,571 --> 01:07:22,489
I broke a nail tryin' to get the tray out.

718
01:07:22,616 --> 01:07:25,701
You oughta buy yourself
a new refrigerator.

719
01:07:28,122 --> 01:07:29,949
I didn't mean right now!

720
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,000
Dr Dreyfuss.

721
01:07:35,588 --> 01:07:37,628
Doc!

722
01:07:38,633 --> 01:07:42,678
There's a girl in my place, took
some sleeping pills. I can't wake her up.

723
01:07:42,804 --> 01:07:44,843
- Let me get my bag.
- Hurry up!

724
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:50,385
Hey, over here, lover.
What's all the running around about?

725
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,190
You're gonna wear yourself out.

726
01:07:54,024 --> 01:07:56,597
- Not so rough, honey!
- Good night.

727
01:07:56,735 --> 01:07:58,775
- Good night?!
- The party's over.

728
01:07:58,904 --> 01:08:01,110
What? Did I do somethin' wrong?

729
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:04,573
It's an emergency.
I'll see you some other time.

730
01:08:04,702 --> 01:08:06,741
Not this one. In there, Doc.

731
01:08:07,747 --> 01:08:11,495
- What's goin' on here, anyway?
- Will you please just get out?!

732
01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:13,168
My shoes!

733
01:08:13,294 --> 01:08:16,295
Some lover you are! Some sexpot!

734
01:08:16,422 --> 01:08:19,174
Here. Find a phone.
Call your husband in Havana.

735
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:24,757
You bet I will! And when I tell him how
you treated me, he'll push your face in!

736
01:08:24,889 --> 01:08:26,929
You fink!

737
01:08:42,491 --> 01:08:44,531
Is she gonna be all right, Doc?

738
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:48,705
- How many pills were in that bottle?
- It was half-full. About a dozen.

739
01:08:48,831 --> 01:08:51,832
- Do you have to take her to the hospital?
- Help me, will you?

740
01:08:51,959 --> 01:08:54,629
- Into the bathroom.
- What are you gonna do?

741
01:08:54,754 --> 01:08:57,541
Get that stuff out of her stomach
if it isn't too late.

742
01:08:57,674 --> 01:09:00,343
You'd better put some coffee on,
and pray.

743
01:09:55,276 --> 01:09:57,315
Bring my bag.

744
01:10:07,163 --> 01:10:09,203
Roll up her right sleeve.

745
01:10:19,009 --> 01:10:21,048
Hold that.

746
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:30,099
Nice veins.

747
01:10:41,866 --> 01:10:44,701
Wanna tell me what happened?

748
01:10:44,827 --> 01:10:47,497
I don't know. I mean, I wasn't even here.

749
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:54,326
You see, we had... some words earlier.

750
01:10:54,462 --> 01:10:58,591
It was nothin' serious.
You might call it a lovers' quarrel.

751
01:10:59,593 --> 01:11:02,510
So you went right out
and picked yourself up another dame.

752
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:07,430
- Something like that.
- You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie pie.

753
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:09,102
Yes, you are.

754
01:11:17,278 --> 01:11:22,403
If you'd come home half an hour later,
you'd have had quite a Christmas present.

755
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:43,259
Get the coffee.

756
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:09,707
Let's get some air in here.
Open the windows.

757
01:12:25,015 --> 01:12:27,055
What's her name?

758
01:12:27,184 --> 01:12:29,889
Miss Kubelik. Fran.

759
01:12:33,274 --> 01:12:38,517
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because
you took too many sleeping pills.

760
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,861
Do you understand what I'm saying?

761
01:12:42,617 --> 01:12:46,069
Fran, I'm Dr Dreyfuss.
I'm here to help you.

762
01:12:46,204 --> 01:12:49,122
You took all those sleeping pills.
Remember?

763
01:12:50,334 --> 01:12:53,952
- Sleeping pills.
- That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.

764
01:12:54,796 --> 01:12:57,632
- Doctor?
- Dr Dreyfuss.

765
01:13:00,135 --> 01:13:01,713
Dreyfuss.

766
01:13:01,846 --> 01:13:03,885
Get more coffee.

767
01:13:04,807 --> 01:13:07,263
Now tell me again. What's my name?

768
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,852
Dr... Dreyfuss.

769
01:13:12,982 --> 01:13:15,022
And what happened to you?

770
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:17,318
I...

771
01:13:17,445 --> 01:13:19,485
I took sleeping pills.

772
01:13:20,073 --> 01:13:22,529
Do you know where you are?

773
01:13:24,536 --> 01:13:27,822
- No.
- Yes, you do, Fran. Now concentrate!

774
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:31,789
I don't know.

775
01:13:32,711 --> 01:13:34,751
Do you know who that is?

776
01:13:41,512 --> 01:13:43,552
Look at him.

777
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,511
Mr Baxter. 19th floor.

778
01:13:48,227 --> 01:13:50,267
Hello, Miss Kubelik.

779
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:53,268
Mr? Miss? Such politeness!

780
01:13:54,567 --> 01:13:58,565
We work in the same building.
We try to keep it quiet.

781
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,909
What are you doing here?

782
01:14:04,494 --> 01:14:08,243
Don't you remember
we were together at the office party?

783
01:14:08,373 --> 01:14:10,781
Oh, yes. The office party.

784
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:13,491
- Miss Olsen.
- That's right.

785
01:14:13,629 --> 01:14:16,583
I told you we had a fight.
That was what it was about.

786
01:14:16,715 --> 01:14:20,049
Miss Olsen. That girl
that was here earlier.

787
01:14:21,637 --> 01:14:24,342
I don't understand.

788
01:14:24,474 --> 01:14:29,848
The main thing is I got here in time and
you're gonna be all right. Isn't she, Doc?

789
01:14:30,772 --> 01:14:33,061
I'm so tired.

790
01:14:33,191 --> 01:14:35,231
Come on. Drink this.

791
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:38,315
Please... just let me sleep.

792
01:14:38,446 --> 01:14:42,231
No, you can't sleep! Fran, open your eyes!

793
01:14:42,909 --> 01:14:44,949
Let's get her walking.

794
01:14:47,623 --> 01:14:52,249
We've got to keep her awake for the next
few hours. Now come on, Fran, walk!

795
01:14:52,378 --> 01:14:54,951
One, two, three, four!

796
01:14:55,089 --> 01:14:57,378
One, two, three, four!

797
01:14:57,508 --> 01:14:59,715
Left, right, left, right...

798
01:14:59,844 --> 01:15:02,086
...left, right and return!

799
01:15:02,221 --> 01:15:05,425
And... one, two, three, four!

800
01:15:05,558 --> 01:15:08,974
Now you've got it! One, two, three, four!

801
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:12,354
Walk, Fran! One, two, three, four!

802
01:15:12,482 --> 01:15:15,151
One, two... And return again.

803
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:18,397
And... left, right, left, right.

804
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:28,954
She'll sleep on and off
for the next 24 hours.

805
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:32,783
Of course, she'll have
a dandy hangover when she wakes up.

806
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,960
Just as long as she's OK.

807
01:15:35,089 --> 01:15:40,594
These cases are harder on the doctor than
the patient. I oughta charge by the mile.

808
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:43,804
- Any of that coffee left?
- Yeah, sure.

809
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:47,263
How do you spell her last name?

810
01:15:47,394 --> 01:15:49,885
<i>Kubelik. Two k's.</i>

811
01:15:50,021 --> 01:15:52,061
What's her address?

812
01:15:52,816 --> 01:15:54,855
Where does she live?

813
01:15:55,861 --> 01:15:58,316
Why do you wanna know, Doc?

814
01:15:59,406 --> 01:16:02,573
- You don't have to report this, do you?
- It's regulations.

815
01:16:02,701 --> 01:16:07,696
But it was an accident. She had too much
to drink, didn't know what she was doing.

816
01:16:07,832 --> 01:16:09,990
There was no suicide note or anything.

817
01:16:10,126 --> 01:16:13,246
- I'm not thinkin' about myself.
- Aren't you?

818
01:16:13,379 --> 01:16:16,878
She's got a family,
and there's the people at the office.

819
01:16:17,008 --> 01:16:20,922
Can't you forget you're a doctor,
just say you're here as a neighbour?

820
01:16:21,054 --> 01:16:23,924
Well, as a doctor, I can't prove
it wasn't an accident.

821
01:16:24,057 --> 01:16:27,260
But as your neighbour,
I'd like to kick you around the block.

822
01:16:27,394 --> 01:16:29,932
- Mind if I cool this off?
- Help yourself.

823
01:16:30,063 --> 01:16:32,471
I don't know what you did to that girl...

824
01:16:32,607 --> 01:16:35,145
...but it was bound to happen,
the way you carry on.

825
01:16:35,277 --> 01:16:37,733
Live now, pay later. Diners Club!

826
01:16:39,698 --> 01:16:42,652
<i>Why don't you grow up, Baxter?
Be a mensch.</i>

827
01:16:42,785 --> 01:16:45,192
- You know what that means?
- I'm not sure.

828
01:16:45,329 --> 01:16:47,369
<i>A mensch! A human being!</i>

829
01:16:48,374 --> 01:16:51,410
So you got off easy this time.
So you were lucky.

830
01:16:51,544 --> 01:16:56,206
But you're not out of the woods yet,
because most of 'em try it again.

831
01:16:57,258 --> 01:16:59,832
Well, you know where I am
if you need me.

832
01:18:11,836 --> 01:18:14,623
Mr Baxter! Open up already.

833
01:18:17,884 --> 01:18:19,877
Oh.

834
01:18:20,011 --> 01:18:23,427
- Mrs Lieberman.
- Who did you think it was? Kriss Kringle?

835
01:18:23,557 --> 01:18:25,680
What was going on here last night?

836
01:18:25,809 --> 01:18:29,178
- Last night?
- All that marching! Tramp, tramp, tramp!

837
01:18:29,313 --> 01:18:32,729
- Army manoeuvres maybe?
- I'll never invite those people again.

838
01:18:32,858 --> 01:18:37,070
What you get from renting to bachelors.
All night I didn't sleep ten minutes.

839
01:18:37,196 --> 01:18:42,701
- And I'm sure you woke up Dr Dreyfuss.
- Don't worry. He was out on a case.

840
01:18:42,827 --> 01:18:47,952
I'm warning you, Mr Baxter. This is
a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.

841
01:18:48,082 --> 01:18:50,122
Come on, Oscar.

842
01:19:17,113 --> 01:19:21,775
Operator, I want White Plains,
New York. Mr JD Sheldrake.

843
01:19:21,909 --> 01:19:23,949
Make that person-to-person.

844
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:31,786
Five, four, three, two, one...

845
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,493
- Let her rip!

846
01:19:34,631 --> 01:19:36,256
I'll get the phone.

847
01:19:36,383 --> 01:19:39,337
Hey, Dad, why don't we
put a fly in the nose cone?

848
01:19:39,469 --> 01:19:42,387
- See if we can bring it back alive.
- That's a thought.

849
01:19:42,514 --> 01:19:46,594
Maybe we should put in two flies
and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

850
01:19:46,727 --> 01:19:50,891
- See if they'll what?
- Propagate. You know. Multiply.

851
01:19:51,023 --> 01:19:54,724
- Baby flies?
- Oh. Oh!

852
01:19:55,569 --> 01:19:58,143
- It's for you, Dad.
- Thanks, Jeff.

853
01:19:58,281 --> 01:20:01,484
A Mr Baxter. Person-to-person.

854
01:20:01,617 --> 01:20:04,239
Come on. Help me round up some flies.

855
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:09,116
- Hello? What's on your mind, Baxter?
- Something came up that's important.

856
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:12,833
I think you should see me
at the apartment as soon as possible.

857
01:20:12,963 --> 01:20:16,711
- What's this all about?
- I didn't wanna tell you over the phone.

858
01:20:16,842 --> 01:20:21,967
But that certain party... You know
who I mean. I found her here last night.

859
01:20:22,097 --> 01:20:25,217
- She took an overdose of sleeping pills.
- What?!

860
01:20:26,602 --> 01:20:30,600
- What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone?
- One of our employees had an accident.

861
01:20:30,731 --> 01:20:34,147
I don't know why they bother me
with these things on Christmas Day.

862
01:20:34,277 --> 01:20:36,104
Yes, Baxter.

863
01:20:36,237 --> 01:20:38,277
Just how serious is it?

864
01:20:38,406 --> 01:20:42,071
It was touch and go there for a while,
but she's sleeping it off now.

865
01:20:42,202 --> 01:20:45,203
I thought maybe you'd like to
be here when she wakes up.

866
01:20:46,289 --> 01:20:50,750
That's impossible. You'll have to
handle the situation yourself, Baxter.

867
01:20:50,877 --> 01:20:55,290
- As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you.
- Yes, sir. I understand.

868
01:20:55,424 --> 01:20:59,801
She left a letter. Would you like me
to open it and read it to you?

869
01:20:59,928 --> 01:21:02,680
Well, it was just a suggestion.

870
01:21:02,806 --> 01:21:06,721
No, don't worry. I kept your name
out of it, so there'll be no trouble...

871
01:21:06,852 --> 01:21:09,308
...policewise or newspaperwise.

872
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:14,942
You see, the doctor is a friend of mine,
so we were very lucky in that respect.

873
01:21:15,069 --> 01:21:17,525
Actually, he thinks she's my girl.

874
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:20,648
No, he just jumped to the conclusion.

875
01:21:20,784 --> 01:21:23,619
Around here I'm known as
quite a ladies' man.

876
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:27,992
Of course, we're not out of the woods yet.
Sometimes they try it again.

877
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:32,039
Yes, sir. I'll do my best. It'll take her
a couple of days to fully recover...

878
01:21:32,170 --> 01:21:35,456
...and I may have a little problem
with the landlady.

879
01:21:36,175 --> 01:21:39,626
OK, Mr Sheldrake. I'll keep her
in the apartment as long as I can.

880
01:21:39,762 --> 01:21:43,297
Isn't there some sort of message
you want me to give her?

881
01:21:43,766 --> 01:21:45,972
Well, I'll... think of something.

882
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,684
Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr Sheldrake.

883
01:21:51,566 --> 01:21:53,605
I'm sorry.

884
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,979
- I'm sorry, Mr Baxter.
- What are you doing out of bed?

885
01:21:58,114 --> 01:22:01,318
I didn't know. I had no idea
this was your apartment.

886
01:22:01,451 --> 01:22:04,156
Here. Let me help you.

887
01:22:04,663 --> 01:22:06,702
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

888
01:22:06,832 --> 01:22:08,871
Why didn't you just let me die?

889
01:22:09,001 --> 01:22:14,588
What kind of talk is that? You got
a little overemotional, but you're fine now.

890
01:22:14,715 --> 01:22:16,174
Oh!

891
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:20,629
Oh, my head! It feels just like
a big wad of chewing gum.

892
01:22:20,763 --> 01:22:23,515
- What time is it?
- Two o'clock.

893
01:22:23,641 --> 01:22:25,883
Oh, my dress. I have to go home.

894
01:22:26,018 --> 01:22:28,474
You're in no shape
to go anywhere but back to bed.

895
01:22:28,604 --> 01:22:31,096
- You don't want me here.
- Sure I do. I...

896
01:22:31,232 --> 01:22:34,352
It's always nice
to have company for Christmas.

897
01:22:34,486 --> 01:22:38,020
- I'm stronger than you are.
- I just wanna brush my teeth.

898
01:22:38,156 --> 01:22:41,691
Oh. Of course. I think I can find
a new toothbrush somewhere.

899
01:22:41,827 --> 01:22:44,496
Here. Put that on.

900
01:23:13,193 --> 01:23:16,941
- How about some breakfast?
- No. I don't want anything.

901
01:23:17,072 --> 01:23:19,111
I'll fix you some coffee.

902
01:23:19,241 --> 01:23:23,570
Oh! We're all out of coffee.
You had quite a lot last night.

903
01:23:23,704 --> 01:23:25,743
Back in a minute.

904
01:23:35,174 --> 01:23:37,499
Mrs Dreyfuss,
could I borrow some coffee?

905
01:23:37,635 --> 01:23:41,419
- And an orange and a couple of eggs?
- Eggs, he asks me for! Oranges!

906
01:23:41,556 --> 01:23:46,052
What you need is a good horsewhipping!
From me the doctor has no secrets.

907
01:23:46,185 --> 01:23:48,427
Poor girl. How could you do such a thing?

908
01:23:48,563 --> 01:23:51,517
I didn't do anything. Honest. It's just...

909
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:57,905
You take a girl out just for laughs and
she thinks you're serious marriagewise.

910
01:23:58,031 --> 01:24:01,531
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger!

911
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:04,744
But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

912
01:24:13,297 --> 01:24:15,041
Who are you calling?

913
01:24:15,174 --> 01:24:17,297
My sister, to tell her
what happened to me.

914
01:24:17,426 --> 01:24:22,385
Wait a minute! Let's talk it over first.
Just what are you gonna tell her?

915
01:24:23,182 --> 01:24:27,132
- I haven't figured it out exactly.
- Well, you'd better figure it out exactly.

916
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:30,355
Suppose she asks you why
you didn't come home last night.

917
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:32,439
I'll say I spent the night with a friend.

918
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:34,607
- Who?
- Someone from the office.

919
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,563
- Where are you now?
- In his apartment.

920
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:39,069
<i>- In his apartment?
- In her apartment.</i>

921
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,406
- What's your friend's name?
- Baxter.

922
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:44,619
- What's her first name?
- Miss.

923
01:24:44,747 --> 01:24:47,582
- When are you comin' home?
- As soon as I can walk.

924
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:49,748
- Your legs hurt?
- No, my stomach.

925
01:24:49,877 --> 01:24:52,664
- Your stomach?
- They had to pump it out!

926
01:24:52,797 --> 01:24:57,708
You shouldn't call anybody. Not till you
get the chewing gum out of your head.

927
01:24:57,844 --> 01:25:01,011
They'll be worried about me.
They might call the police.

928
01:25:01,139 --> 01:25:04,342
We have to be careful.
We don't wanna involve anybody.

929
01:25:04,476 --> 01:25:07,560
After all, Mr Sheldrake's a married man.

930
01:25:08,396 --> 01:25:10,436
Thanks for reminding me!

931
01:25:14,236 --> 01:25:16,275
I didn't mean it that way.

932
01:25:16,405 --> 01:25:20,533
I was just talking to him on the phone.
He's very concerned about you.

933
01:25:20,659 --> 01:25:23,411
He doesn't give a damn about me.

934
01:25:23,537 --> 01:25:27,286
- You're wrong. He told me...
- He's a liar.

935
01:25:27,416 --> 01:25:29,658
But that's not the worst part.

936
01:25:29,794 --> 01:25:32,166
The worst part is I still love him.

937
01:25:36,217 --> 01:25:38,424
Oh. That must be Mrs Dreyfuss.

938
01:25:38,553 --> 01:25:42,004
Remember the doctor from last night?
That's his wife.

939
01:25:43,725 --> 01:25:45,765
So where's the victim?

940
01:25:46,812 --> 01:25:48,851
Max the Knife!

941
01:25:51,483 --> 01:25:55,730
<i>- Nu, little lady, how are we feeling today?
- I don't know. Kind of dizzy.</i>

942
01:25:55,863 --> 01:26:01,237
The best thing for dizzy is noodle soup
with chicken white meat and a glass tea.

943
01:26:01,368 --> 01:26:05,829
- No, thank you. I'm really not hungry.
- Go ahead, eat. Enjoy.

944
01:26:05,957 --> 01:26:08,874
You wouldn't have such a thing
as a napkin, would you?

945
01:26:09,001 --> 01:26:12,205
- I have some paper towels.
- Beatnik.

946
01:26:12,338 --> 01:26:15,838
In my kitchen, third drawer,
under the good silver, are napkins.

947
01:26:15,967 --> 01:26:17,342
Yes, Mrs Dreyfuss.

948
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:20,090
So, what are you waiting for?
A singing commercial?

949
01:26:20,221 --> 01:26:22,261
- I can't eat.
- You must eat.

950
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:25,557
And you must get healthy
and you must forget him.

951
01:26:25,685 --> 01:26:28,971
Such a fine boy he seemed
when he first moved in here.

952
01:26:29,106 --> 01:26:32,107
Clean and cut, a regular lvy Leaguer.

953
01:26:32,234 --> 01:26:36,695
Turns out he's King Farouk,
with the drinking, with the cha-cha.

954
01:26:36,822 --> 01:26:38,862
With the no napkins.

955
01:26:38,991 --> 01:26:43,036
A girl like you, for the rest of your life
you wanna cry in your noodle soup?

956
01:26:43,162 --> 01:26:45,736
Who needs it? Now you listen to me.

957
01:26:45,873 --> 01:26:50,037
You'll find yourself a nice,
substantial man - a widower, maybe -

958
01:26:50,169 --> 01:26:53,835
<i>and settle down, instead of
noshing all those sleeping pills.</i>

959
01:26:53,965 --> 01:26:57,132
For what? For whom?
For some good-time Charlie?

960
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:59,169
- Shh.

961
01:26:59,304 --> 01:27:03,349
One napkin comin' up. Wish we had
some champagne to wrap it around.

962
01:27:03,475 --> 01:27:06,642
- What did I tell you?
- Mrs Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.

963
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:10,720
- I'll wash the dishes.
- You'd break 'em. I'll come back for them.

964
01:27:10,858 --> 01:27:13,349
If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

965
01:27:14,695 --> 01:27:18,527
- She doesn't seem to like you very much.
- Oh, I don't mind.

966
01:27:18,657 --> 01:27:21,231
As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered.

967
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:26,529
That anybody'd think a girl like you would
do a thing like this over a guy like me.

968
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:30,835
Did you find something here?
An envelope?

969
01:27:30,962 --> 01:27:32,540
Yes. I've got it.

970
01:27:32,672 --> 01:27:37,050
Don't you think we'd better destroy it
so it won't fall in the wrong hands?

971
01:27:37,177 --> 01:27:39,216
Open it.

972
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:45,465
There's nothing here but a $100 bill.

973
01:27:45,602 --> 01:27:48,971
That's right. Will you see
that Mr Sheldrake gets it?

974
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:52,188
Sure.

975
01:27:53,694 --> 01:27:55,734
Take this away, will you?

976
01:27:56,447 --> 01:27:59,318
Would you like me to move
the television set in here?

977
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:02,202
- You play gin rummy?
- I'm not very good at it.

978
01:28:02,328 --> 01:28:06,326
- I am. Let me get the cards.
- You don't have to entertain me.

979
01:28:06,457 --> 01:28:10,206
There's nothing I'd like better.
You know. Togetherness.

980
01:28:10,336 --> 01:28:15,046
Guess what I did last Christmas. Had
dinner at the automat, went to the zoo...

981
01:28:15,175 --> 01:28:17,962
...then came home and cleaned up
after Mr Eichelberger.

982
01:28:18,095 --> 01:28:20,467
He had a little eggnog party here.

983
01:28:20,597 --> 01:28:22,886
So I'm way ahead this year.

984
01:28:23,016 --> 01:28:25,768
Three across. Spades double?

985
01:28:25,894 --> 01:28:27,934
High deals.

986
01:28:28,606 --> 01:28:30,645
Six? Eight.

987
01:28:38,658 --> 01:28:41,528
I think I'm gonna give it all up.

988
01:28:42,787 --> 01:28:44,531
Give what up?

989
01:28:47,584 --> 01:28:50,585
Why do people have to
love people, anyway?

990
01:28:52,005 --> 01:28:54,045
I know what you mean.

991
01:28:57,302 --> 01:28:59,342
Queen.

992
01:29:02,099 --> 01:29:04,555
- I don't want it.
- Pick a card.

993
01:29:09,398 --> 01:29:13,776
What do you call it when somebody keeps
gettin' smashed up in car accidents?

994
01:29:13,903 --> 01:29:17,189
- Bad insurance risk?
- That's me with men.

995
01:29:18,866 --> 01:29:23,659
I was jinxed from the word go. First time
I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

996
01:29:23,788 --> 01:29:25,911
A cemetery?

997
01:29:26,041 --> 01:29:28,792
I was 15. We used to go there to smoke.

998
01:29:28,919 --> 01:29:33,047
His name was George and
he threw me over for a drum majorette.

999
01:29:34,508 --> 01:29:36,547
Uh, gin.

1000
01:29:39,972 --> 01:29:45,263
That's 10, 20... 36.
And 25 makes 61 and two boxes.

1001
01:29:45,394 --> 01:29:47,470
I have this talent for falling in love...

1002
01:29:47,605 --> 01:29:51,056
...with the wrong guy
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1003
01:29:51,818 --> 01:29:53,976
Well, how many guys were there?

1004
01:29:55,196 --> 01:29:57,023
Three.

1005
01:29:57,156 --> 01:30:01,106
The last one was the manager of a finance
company back home in Pittsburgh.

1006
01:30:01,244 --> 01:30:03,284
They found a shortage in his accounts.

1007
01:30:03,413 --> 01:30:07,162
He asked me to wait for him.
He'll be out in 1965.

1008
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:10,750
Cut.

1009
01:30:11,421 --> 01:30:16,499
So I came to New York and moved in with
my sister and her husband, a cab driver.

1010
01:30:16,635 --> 01:30:21,511
They sent me to secretarial school and
then I applied for a job at Consolidated.

1011
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:23,847
But I flunked the typing test.

1012
01:30:23,976 --> 01:30:26,763
- Too slow?
- No. I can type up a storm.

1013
01:30:26,896 --> 01:30:28,935
I just can't spell.

1014
01:30:29,982 --> 01:30:35,060
So they gave me a pair of white gloves
and stuck me in an elevator.

1015
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:37,652
And that's how I met Jeff.

1016
01:30:38,867 --> 01:30:41,536
Oh God, I'm so fouled up.

1017
01:30:41,661 --> 01:30:44,069
What am I gonna do now?

1018
01:30:46,291 --> 01:30:48,498
Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.

1019
01:30:50,128 --> 01:30:52,999
Was he very upset when you told him?

1020
01:30:53,132 --> 01:30:55,171
Mr Sheldrake? Yeah, very.

1021
01:30:56,468 --> 01:31:00,169
Maybe he does love me, only he doesn't
have the nerve to tell his wife.

1022
01:31:00,306 --> 01:31:01,765
I'm sure that's it.

1023
01:31:01,891 --> 01:31:05,260
- You really think so?
- No doubt about it.

1024
01:31:06,687 --> 01:31:08,976
Would you hand me that pad and pencil?

1025
01:31:09,107 --> 01:31:12,143
- What for?
- I'm gonna write to Mrs Sheldrake.

1026
01:31:12,277 --> 01:31:14,602
- You what?
- As one woman to another.

1027
01:31:14,737 --> 01:31:18,687
- I'm sure she'll understand.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

1028
01:31:18,825 --> 01:31:22,241
- Why not?
- For one thing, you can't spell.

1029
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:26,499
Secondly, if you did something
like that, you'd hate yourself.

1030
01:31:27,668 --> 01:31:30,337
I don't like myself very much anyway.

1031
01:31:32,297 --> 01:31:34,705
Pick up the cards. Let's go.

1032
01:31:34,842 --> 01:31:37,926
- Do I have to?
- You bet. I got a terrific hand.

1033
01:31:44,685 --> 01:31:47,556
- You really wanna discard that?
- Sure.

1034
01:31:47,689 --> 01:31:49,515
Gin.

1035
01:31:53,862 --> 01:31:58,820
10, 20, 40, 52 and 25... 77.

1036
01:31:59,576 --> 01:32:03,028
Spades are double... 154.

1037
01:32:08,210 --> 01:32:10,250
Blitzed. Two games.

1038
01:33:40,431 --> 01:33:43,717
- All right, all right, Mrs Dreyfuss.

1039
01:33:51,234 --> 01:33:53,061
<i>- Hi, Baxter.
- What do you want?</i>

1040
01:33:53,195 --> 01:33:55,234
What do I want? Just a minute.

1041
01:33:55,364 --> 01:33:58,033
- You can't come in!
- What's the matter with you?

1042
01:33:58,158 --> 01:34:00,234
I made a reservation for four o'clock.

1043
01:34:00,369 --> 01:34:02,694
You can't stay.
Take your champagne and go.

1044
01:34:02,830 --> 01:34:06,365
I don't wanna pull rank on you,
but I told the little lady it was all set.

1045
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:10,201
Are you gonna leave, Mr Kirkeby,
or do I have to throw you out?

1046
01:34:11,172 --> 01:34:13,924
Buddy-boy,
why didn't you say so?

1047
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:17,419
- Got yourself a little playmate, huh?
- Now will you get out?

1048
01:34:23,059 --> 01:34:26,428
Hey, come on! What are we waiting for?
Open up, will you?

1049
01:34:26,563 --> 01:34:28,603
Mildred!

1050
01:34:30,192 --> 01:34:34,653
- What's holding things up?
- Say, let's have a party, the four of us.

1051
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:36,819
No!

1052
01:34:41,036 --> 01:34:43,362
Well, I don't blame you.

1053
01:34:43,497 --> 01:34:46,498
So you hit the jackpot, eh, kid?
I mean Kubelikwise.

1054
01:34:46,626 --> 01:34:49,081
Don't worry.
I won't say a word to anybody.

1055
01:34:49,462 --> 01:34:51,501
Stay with it, Buddy-boy.

1056
01:35:06,605 --> 01:35:08,644
Who was that?

1057
01:35:09,358 --> 01:35:12,857
Just somebody delivering
a bottle of champagne. Like some?

1058
01:35:13,737 --> 01:35:16,407
Would you mind opening that window?

1059
01:35:19,201 --> 01:35:24,540
- Now don't get any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
- I just want some fresh air.

1060
01:35:24,665 --> 01:35:28,034
It's only one storey down.
The best you could do is break a leg.

1061
01:35:28,169 --> 01:35:30,874
So they'll shoot me, like a horse.

1062
01:35:31,214 --> 01:35:34,583
Please, you gotta promise me
you won't do anything foolish.

1063
01:35:34,717 --> 01:35:37,173
<i>- Who'd care?
- I would.</i>

1064
01:35:42,934 --> 01:35:46,849
Why can't I ever fall in love
with somebody nice like you?

1065
01:35:47,773 --> 01:35:49,812
Yeah. Well...

1066
01:35:50,484 --> 01:35:53,438
That's the way it crumbles, cookiewise.

1067
01:35:54,822 --> 01:35:57,277
Go to sleep.

1068
01:36:31,443 --> 01:36:36,189
- Good morning, Mr Sheldrake.
- Miss Olsen, come into my office, please.

1069
01:36:45,625 --> 01:36:49,575
- Did you have a nice Christmas?
- Lovely. You were a great help!

1070
01:36:49,712 --> 01:36:52,382
Your pep talk to Miss Kubelik
at the office party.

1071
01:36:52,507 --> 01:36:57,134
- Sorry, Jeff. I never could hold my liquor.
- I thought you could hold your tongue.

1072
01:36:57,262 --> 01:36:59,800
- It won't happen again.
- You bet it won't.

1073
01:36:59,932 --> 01:37:02,886
I'll arrange for you to get
a month's severance pay.

1074
01:37:03,018 --> 01:37:06,019
That's right, Miss Olsen.
I'm letting you go.

1075
01:37:06,772 --> 01:37:09,346
You let me go four years ago, Jeff.

1076
01:37:09,483 --> 01:37:13,896
And were cruel enough to make me sit out
there and watch the new models pass by.

1077
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:17,196
I'd appreciate it if you'd be
out of here as soon as you can.

1078
01:37:17,325 --> 01:37:19,364
Yes, Mr Sheldrake.

1079
01:37:28,169 --> 01:37:32,381
Operator, this is Mr Sheldrake. I'd like
Mr Baxter's home telephone number.

1080
01:37:32,507 --> 01:37:35,378
He's in Ordinary Premium Accounting.

1081
01:37:50,776 --> 01:37:54,359
<i>- Hello?
- Hello. Jeff Sheldrake. Can you talk?</i>

1082
01:37:55,114 --> 01:37:56,941
Yes. She's in the shower.

1083
01:37:57,075 --> 01:37:59,779
- She's coming along fine, considering.
- Good.

1084
01:37:59,911 --> 01:38:03,576
- Is there anything you need? Money?
- No, thank you, Mr Sheldrake.

1085
01:38:03,706 --> 01:38:06,873
As a matter of fact, I have
some money for you. $100.

1086
01:38:07,002 --> 01:38:08,412
Oh.

1087
01:38:08,545 --> 01:38:12,377
- If there's anything I can do for you...
- For me? I don't think so.

1088
01:38:12,507 --> 01:38:15,259
<i>But I was hoping maybe
you could do something for her.</i>

1089
01:38:15,552 --> 01:38:18,921
Like what? Put yourself
in my place, Baxter.

1090
01:38:19,056 --> 01:38:21,262
How can I help her? My hands are tied.

1091
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,015
Well... at least you can talk to her.

1092
01:38:26,147 --> 01:38:29,729
Let me put her on. And please, be gentle.

1093
01:38:30,443 --> 01:38:32,934
There's a call for you!

1094
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:35,526
- For me?
- Yeah. Mr Sheldrake.

1095
01:38:37,492 --> 01:38:39,531
I don't wanna talk to him.

1096
01:38:39,661 --> 01:38:41,618
I think you should.

1097
01:38:41,746 --> 01:38:47,085
I gotta run down to the grocery anyway.
There's nothing left here but frozen pizza.

1098
01:38:47,919 --> 01:38:49,959
I'll be right back. OK?

1099
01:39:10,443 --> 01:39:12,483
Hello, Jeff.

1100
01:39:13,947 --> 01:39:17,113
- Yes, I'm all right.
- Why did you do it, Fran?

1101
01:39:17,242 --> 01:39:19,733
It's so childish,
and it never solves anything.

1102
01:39:19,869 --> 01:39:22,539
I oughta be very angry with you,
scaring me that way.

1103
01:39:22,664 --> 01:39:27,456
But let's forget the whole thing, pretend
it never happened. What do you say?

1104
01:39:27,586 --> 01:39:29,625
Fran?

1105
01:39:30,088 --> 01:39:32,626
<i>Are you there, Fran?</i>

1106
01:39:34,134 --> 01:39:38,631
Of course I'm not here, because
the whole thing never happened.

1107
01:39:38,764 --> 01:39:42,632
I never took those pills,
I never loved you...

1108
01:39:42,768 --> 01:39:45,010
...we never even met.

1109
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:50,233
- Isn't that the way you want it, Jeff?
- You know I didn't mean it that way.

1110
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:53,195
You just get well.
Do what the nurse says. I mean Baxter.

1111
01:39:53,321 --> 01:39:56,405
I'll see you as soon as I can.
Goodbye, Fran.

1112
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:17,334
Hello, Mrs Sheldrake. This is Miss Olsen.

1113
01:40:17,471 --> 01:40:21,635
Fine, thank you. I was wondering
if we could have lunch together.

1114
01:40:22,518 --> 01:40:26,219
I don't know how important it is,
but you might find it educational.

1115
01:40:26,356 --> 01:40:29,060
It concerns your husband.

1116
01:40:29,192 --> 01:40:32,893
All right. One o'clock,
Longchamps, Madison and 59th.

1117
01:40:39,202 --> 01:40:41,444
Don't worry. I'm on my way.

1118
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:43,619
Just making a personal call.

1119
01:40:45,334 --> 01:40:47,373
Here's a dime.

1120
01:40:50,172 --> 01:40:51,714
Going down.

1121
01:41:04,103 --> 01:41:06,725
Oh, Mr Baxter! I'm glad you're here.

1122
01:41:06,856 --> 01:41:09,478
- I was just going to get the passkey.
- What for?

1123
01:41:09,609 --> 01:41:12,444
I thought I smelled gas
coming from your apartment.

1124
01:41:12,570 --> 01:41:14,610
Gas?!

1125
01:41:23,707 --> 01:41:25,747
Miss Kubelik?

1126
01:41:27,628 --> 01:41:29,668
Miss Kubelik!

1127
01:41:32,383 --> 01:41:34,422
- You all right?
- Sure!

1128
01:41:35,344 --> 01:41:38,511
- What's that funny smell?
- Gas! Didn't you turn it on?

1129
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:41,640
Yes, to boil water to get
the coffee stains out of my dress.

1130
01:41:41,768 --> 01:41:45,184
- You turned it on but you didn't light it.
- Are you supposed to?

1131
01:41:45,313 --> 01:41:49,145
In this house you're supposed to.
Hey, what are you doing with that?

1132
01:41:49,275 --> 01:41:52,727
I was washing my stockings,
so I thought I'd wash your socks too.

1133
01:41:52,863 --> 01:41:57,026
- Oh. Thank you.
- Very curious. I could only find 3 ½ pair.

1134
01:41:57,159 --> 01:41:59,650
Things are a little disorganised
around here.

1135
01:41:59,786 --> 01:42:03,654
I'd say. What's a tennis racket
doing in the kitchen?

1136
01:42:03,791 --> 01:42:08,702
Tennis racket? Oh, I remember.
I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.

1137
01:42:08,838 --> 01:42:11,589
I used it to strain the spaghetti.

1138
01:42:11,716 --> 01:42:14,289
- Why not?
- In fact, I'm a pretty good cook.

1139
01:42:14,427 --> 01:42:17,214
- Only I'm a lousy housekeeper.
- Yes, you are.

1140
01:42:17,346 --> 01:42:21,759
When I was straightening up the couch,
I found six hairpins, a lipstick...

1141
01:42:21,893 --> 01:42:25,558
...a pair of false eyelashes and
a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.

1142
01:42:25,689 --> 01:42:29,022
It's just that I'm the kind of guy
who can't say no.

1143
01:42:29,150 --> 01:42:33,231
- I don't mean to girls. I mean...
- To someone like Mr Sheldrake.

1144
01:42:33,363 --> 01:42:36,448
- I guess so.
- I know so.

1145
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:40,616
- He's a taker.
- What?

1146
01:42:41,205 --> 01:42:43,447
Some people take, some people get took.

1147
01:42:43,582 --> 01:42:47,627
And they know they're gettin' took
and there's nothin' they can do about it.

1148
01:42:47,753 --> 01:42:49,793
I wouldn't say that.

1149
01:42:50,548 --> 01:42:52,587
What would you like for dinner, huh?

1150
01:42:52,717 --> 01:42:55,920
Hey. Onion soup, and canned asparagus...

1151
01:42:56,054 --> 01:42:58,093
I really should be getting home.

1152
01:42:58,223 --> 01:43:01,224
- My family'll be flipping by now.
- You can't leave yet.

1153
01:43:01,351 --> 01:43:05,728
The doctor said it takes 48 hours
to get that stuff out of your system.

1154
01:43:06,815 --> 01:43:11,109
How long does it take to get someone
you're stuck on out of your system?

1155
01:43:11,236 --> 01:43:14,190
If only they'd invent
some kind of pump for that.

1156
01:43:14,323 --> 01:43:19,946
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You
think it's the end of the world. But it's not.

1157
01:43:20,079 --> 01:43:22,652
I went through exactly
the same thing myself.

1158
01:43:22,790 --> 01:43:24,747
- You did?
- Well, not exactly the same.

1159
01:43:24,875 --> 01:43:26,619
I tried to do it with a gun.

1160
01:43:26,752 --> 01:43:29,872
- Over a girl?
- Worse. It was the wife of my best friend.

1161
01:43:30,006 --> 01:43:35,047
And I was mad about her. But I knew
it was hopeless and I decided to end it all.

1162
01:43:35,178 --> 01:43:39,306
I went to a pawnshop and I bought a.45
automatic and I drove up to Eden Park...

1163
01:43:39,432 --> 01:43:41,555
- Do you know Cincinnati?
- No, I don't.

1164
01:43:41,685 --> 01:43:44,354
Anyway, I parked the car
and I loaded that gun...

1165
01:43:44,479 --> 01:43:48,857
You read in the papers that people shoot
themselves. Believe me, it's not that easy.

1166
01:43:48,984 --> 01:43:52,602
I mean, how do you do it?
Here? Here? Here?

1167
01:43:53,989 --> 01:43:56,659
- Know where I finally shot myself?
- Where?

1168
01:43:56,784 --> 01:43:58,693
- Here.
- In the knee?!

1169
01:43:58,828 --> 01:44:01,366
Yeah! I was sittin' there, tryin' to decide.

1170
01:44:01,497 --> 01:44:03,869
A cop came up because
I was illegally parked.

1171
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,369
I tried to hide the gun
under the seat and it went off.

1172
01:44:07,503 --> 01:44:11,169
- That's terrible!
- It was a year till I could bend the knee.

1173
01:44:11,299 --> 01:44:14,419
But I got over the girl in three weeks.

1174
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:19,755
Still lives in Cincinnati.
Has four kids and gained 20 pounds.

1175
01:44:19,891 --> 01:44:22,299
Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.

1176
01:44:22,436 --> 01:44:24,891
Are you just making this up
to make me feel better?

1177
01:44:25,022 --> 01:44:27,061
Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.

1178
01:44:27,191 --> 01:44:29,397
- Do you wanna see my knee?
- No, thank you.

1179
01:44:29,526 --> 01:44:32,812
The fellas in the office might
get the wrong idea how I found out.

1180
01:44:32,947 --> 01:44:37,075
Let 'em! Look, I'm gonna cook dinner
for us. We'll have fruitcake for dessert.

1181
01:44:37,201 --> 01:44:40,451
You just sit there and rest.
You've done enough for today.

1182
01:44:40,579 --> 01:44:43,830
- Yes, Nurse.

1183
01:44:57,973 --> 01:45:01,223
- Can I help you?
- I'm lookin' for Miss Kubelik.

1184
01:45:01,351 --> 01:45:06,559
- So am I. She didn't report this morning.
- She didn't? Who's in charge here?

1185
01:45:06,690 --> 01:45:11,068
That comes under General Office
Administration. Mr Dobisch, 21st floor.

1186
01:45:11,195 --> 01:45:12,938
Thanks.

1187
01:45:15,449 --> 01:45:19,946
So I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and
guess who he's stashed in the bedroom.

1188
01:45:20,079 --> 01:45:21,360
- Who?
- Kubelik.

1189
01:45:21,497 --> 01:45:24,617
No kiddin'? Buddy-boy and Kubelik
having a little toot?

1190
01:45:24,751 --> 01:45:29,247
Toot? More like a lost weekend.
Neither of 'em showed up for work today.

1191
01:45:29,380 --> 01:45:31,041
AWOL, hm?

1192
01:45:31,174 --> 01:45:33,748
What gripes me is
they guzzled my champagne...

1193
01:45:33,885 --> 01:45:37,420
...while Sylvia and I wound up
at the Guggenheim Museum.

1194
01:45:39,099 --> 01:45:41,139
- Mr Dobisch?
- Yeah.

1195
01:45:42,186 --> 01:45:46,397
I'm Karl Matuschka. My sister-in-law
runs one of the elevators. Fran Kubelik.

1196
01:45:46,523 --> 01:45:48,018
- Miss Kubelik?
- You know her?

1197
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:52,018
Of course. We have a lot of employees,
but we're one big, happy family.

1198
01:45:52,154 --> 01:45:57,279
She lives with us, and my wife's nervous
cos Fran hasn't been home for two days.

1199
01:45:57,410 --> 01:45:58,785
That so?

1200
01:45:58,911 --> 01:46:01,996
So we wondered if somebody here
knew what happened to her.

1201
01:46:02,123 --> 01:46:03,582
I see.

1202
01:46:03,708 --> 01:46:07,326
What do you think, Al?
Can we help the man?

1203
01:46:07,462 --> 01:46:10,878
Why not? We don't owe
Buddy-boy anything.

1204
01:46:11,007 --> 01:46:14,507
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy
done for us lately?

1205
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:19,052
Who is Buddy-boy?

1206
01:46:43,249 --> 01:46:47,117
- Are we dressing for dinner?
- No. Just come as you are.

1207
01:46:47,254 --> 01:46:51,382
- You're pretty good with that racket.
- You should see my backhand.

1208
01:46:53,427 --> 01:46:56,428
Wait till you see me serve the meatballs.

1209
01:46:56,555 --> 01:47:00,635
- Shall I light the candles?
- It's a must, gracious livingwise.

1210
01:47:03,854 --> 01:47:05,265
<i>¶ Meatball</i>

1211
01:47:09,026 --> 01:47:10,651
<i>¶ Meatball</i>

1212
01:47:19,704 --> 01:47:22,705
- You bought some napkins.
- Might as well go all the way.

1213
01:47:26,127 --> 01:47:28,535
You know, I used to live
like Robinson Crusoe.

1214
01:47:28,672 --> 01:47:30,914
Shipwrecked, among eight million people.

1215
01:47:31,049 --> 01:47:34,216
And then one day I saw
a footprint in the sand...

1216
01:47:34,344 --> 01:47:36,384
...and there you were.

1217
01:47:37,306 --> 01:47:39,548
It's a wonderful thing, dinner for two.

1218
01:47:39,683 --> 01:47:43,551
- Do you usually eat alone?
- No. Sometimes I eat with Ed Sullivan.

1219
01:47:43,687 --> 01:47:46,523
Or sometimes Dinah Shore
or Perry Como.

1220
01:47:46,649 --> 01:47:50,647
The other night it was Mae West.
She was much younger then. Cheers.

1221
01:47:50,778 --> 01:47:53,613
- Cheers.
- Know what we're gonna do after dinner?

1222
01:47:53,781 --> 01:47:55,857
- The dishes.
- I mean after that.

1223
01:47:55,992 --> 01:47:58,281
- What?
- You don't have to if you don't want to.

1224
01:47:58,411 --> 01:48:00,819
- Oh, I don't?
- We're gonna finish the gin game.

1225
01:48:00,956 --> 01:48:03,625
- So keep a clear head.

1226
01:48:04,459 --> 01:48:08,504
Cos I don't wanna take advantage of you,
the way I did yesterday in bed.

1227
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:10,753
- Baxter?
- Yes.

1228
01:48:19,892 --> 01:48:22,597
What's with you, Fran?
Did you forget where you live?

1229
01:48:22,728 --> 01:48:26,429
- My brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
- Oh! How do you do, Mr Matusch...

1230
01:48:26,566 --> 01:48:30,979
- Get dressed. I got the cab downstairs.
- Wait. I know what you're thinking, but...

1231
01:48:31,112 --> 01:48:33,899
It's none of my business
what you do. You're over 21.

1232
01:48:34,032 --> 01:48:37,650
- But your sister thinks you're a lady.
- All we were gonna do was eat!

1233
01:48:37,786 --> 01:48:40,277
If there wasn't a lady present,
I'd clobber you.

1234
01:48:40,413 --> 01:48:43,284
All right, Karl! I'll get dressed.

1235
01:48:52,509 --> 01:48:54,549
Want a martini?

1236
01:48:58,557 --> 01:49:02,425
How about some spaghetti
with meat sauce that I cooked myself?

1237
01:49:07,942 --> 01:49:10,729
Your sister-in-law sure is terrific.

1238
01:49:13,990 --> 01:49:18,533
It must be murder drivin' a cab
in New York with the cross-town traffic.

1239
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,039
Hi, Baxter. How's the patient?

1240
01:49:25,169 --> 01:49:27,161
Oh, uh... I'm fine, Doc.

1241
01:49:27,296 --> 01:49:29,335
Not you. Miss Kubelik.

1242
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:35,049
- What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
- This is Mr Matuschka. He's... got a cab.

1243
01:49:35,179 --> 01:49:37,635
- Fran been sick?
- No. Just a little accident.

1244
01:49:37,765 --> 01:49:41,715
- What does he mean, accident?
- Well... these things happen all the time.

1245
01:49:41,853 --> 01:49:44,011
What things? What kind
of a doctor are you?

1246
01:49:44,147 --> 01:49:47,350
Not that kind! He just gave her
a shot, pumped out her stomach.

1247
01:49:47,484 --> 01:49:50,687
- What for?
- I took sleeping pills. But I'm fine now.

1248
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:53,394
- Why'd you take sleeping pills?
- On account of me.

1249
01:49:53,531 --> 01:49:55,571
You?

1250
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:57,492
Who else?

1251
01:50:02,374 --> 01:50:04,414
Leave him alone!

1252
01:50:06,795 --> 01:50:10,081
Oh, you fool. You damn fool.

1253
01:50:12,218 --> 01:50:15,302
- Come on, Fran.
- Goodbye, Mr Baxter.

1254
01:50:21,269 --> 01:50:23,308
Goodbye, Doctor.

1255
01:50:25,231 --> 01:50:29,977
Well, I don't wanna gloat, but
just between us, you had it coming to you.

1256
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:35,198
You're gonna have a shiner tomorrow.

1257
01:50:35,325 --> 01:50:37,152
Let me get my bag.

1258
01:50:39,288 --> 01:50:41,327
Don't bother, Doc.

1259
01:50:41,457 --> 01:50:43,496
It doesn't hurt a bit.

1260
01:51:05,315 --> 01:51:07,640
Mr Sheldrake's office? This is CC Baxter.

1261
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:11,026
Please tell him I'd like to
come up and see him. It's important.

1262
01:51:11,154 --> 01:51:13,194
Will you call me back, please?

1263
01:51:15,993 --> 01:51:19,029
Mr Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1264
01:51:20,247 --> 01:51:22,287
All your troubles are over.

1265
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:26,336
I'm gonna take Miss Kubelik
off your hands.

1266
01:51:27,171 --> 01:51:29,627
The plain fact is, I love her.

1267
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:33,123
I thought you should be the first to know.

1268
01:51:33,261 --> 01:51:36,178
After all, you don't really
want her, and I do.

1269
01:51:36,306 --> 01:51:40,434
And though it may sound presumptuous,
she needs somebody like me.

1270
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:44,012
- So I think it would be best all around.

1271
01:51:44,147 --> 01:51:45,606
Solutionwise.

1272
01:51:45,732 --> 01:51:47,013
Yes?

1273
01:51:47,150 --> 01:51:49,309
I'll be right up.

1274
01:51:49,444 --> 01:51:52,813
Mr Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1275
01:51:52,948 --> 01:51:54,988
All your troubles are over.

1276
01:51:59,288 --> 01:52:01,530
19.

1277
01:52:01,665 --> 01:52:05,366
- Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
- Hit by a swinging door?

1278
01:52:05,503 --> 01:52:08,420
- Or a yellow cab?
- That guy really must've belted him.

1279
01:52:08,548 --> 01:52:11,751
Yeah. He's punchy. Talking to himself.

1280
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:13,385
27.

1281
01:52:13,511 --> 01:52:15,967
Those two days
she spent in the apartment...

1282
01:52:16,097 --> 01:52:19,098
...made me realise
how lonely I'd been before.

1283
01:52:19,225 --> 01:52:22,760
But, thanks to you, I'm
in a financial position to marry her.

1284
01:52:22,896 --> 01:52:25,932
If I can ever square things with her family.

1285
01:52:26,066 --> 01:52:28,474
Good morning. CC Baxter.

1286
01:52:32,448 --> 01:52:34,487
<i>- Mr Baxter is here.
- Send him in.</i>

1287
01:52:36,744 --> 01:52:39,661
Mr Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1288
01:52:39,789 --> 01:52:41,912
<i>And I've got good news for you, Baxter.</i>

1289
01:52:42,041 --> 01:52:44,330
- All your troubles are over.
- Sir?

1290
01:52:44,669 --> 01:52:47,872
I know how worried you were
about Miss Kubelik. Stop worrying.

1291
01:52:48,005 --> 01:52:50,876
I'm going to take her off your hands.

1292
01:52:51,009 --> 01:52:53,926
<i>- You're gonna take her off my hands?
- That's right.</i>

1293
01:52:54,053 --> 01:52:56,509
I've moved out of the house.

1294
01:52:57,474 --> 01:53:00,475
I'm gonna be staying in town,
at the Athletic Club.

1295
01:53:00,602 --> 01:53:03,603
- You left your wife.
- If you must know, I fired my secretary.

1296
01:53:03,730 --> 01:53:08,558
My secretary got to my wife, and my wife
fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?

1297
01:53:08,694 --> 01:53:10,236
Yeah.

1298
01:53:10,362 --> 01:53:12,271
Now what's your news, Baxter?

1299
01:53:14,450 --> 01:53:18,198
It's about Miss Kubelik. She's feeling
all right again so she went home.

1300
01:53:18,329 --> 01:53:21,413
Swell. And don't think
I've forgotten what you did for me.

1301
01:53:21,541 --> 01:53:23,580
This way, Baxter.

1302
01:53:27,005 --> 01:53:29,377
Sit down. Try it on for size.

1303
01:53:30,425 --> 01:53:32,963
- You like? It's all yours.
- Mine?

1304
01:53:33,094 --> 01:53:38,302
My assistant has been shifted to the
Denver office and you're taking his place.

1305
01:53:38,433 --> 01:53:40,889
What's the matter?
You don't seem very excited.

1306
01:53:41,019 --> 01:53:45,266
Well, it's just that so many things
have been happening so fast.

1307
01:53:45,399 --> 01:53:48,186
I'm very pleased.
Especially for Miss Kubelik.

1308
01:53:48,318 --> 01:53:53,313
I think she's the kind of girl that definitely
ought to be married to... someone.

1309
01:53:53,449 --> 01:53:58,954
Sure, sure. But first the property has to be
settled. Then it takes six weeks in Reno.

1310
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:01,997
Meanwhile I'm going to enjoy
being a bachelor for a while.

1311
01:54:02,125 --> 01:54:05,576
Oh, Baxter, you now can have lunch
in the executive dining room.

1312
01:54:05,712 --> 01:54:08,381
That's one of the privileges
that goes with this job.

1313
01:54:08,506 --> 01:54:13,133
You also get a nice little expense account,
use of the executive washroom...

1314
01:54:13,261 --> 01:54:15,669
Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

1315
01:54:15,806 --> 01:54:18,510
- I got kicked in the head too.
- Oh?

1316
01:54:39,622 --> 01:54:41,745
Good evening, Mr Baxter.

1317
01:54:41,874 --> 01:54:43,369
Oh.

1318
01:54:43,501 --> 01:54:46,288
Miss Kubelik. How are you feeling?

1319
01:54:46,421 --> 01:54:49,126
- I feel fine. How's your eye?
- Oh, fine.

1320
01:54:49,257 --> 01:54:52,092
- How are things at the apartment?
- Nothing's changed.

1321
01:54:52,219 --> 01:54:55,173
- We never did finish that gin game.
- I know.

1322
01:54:56,890 --> 01:54:59,262
I suppose you heard about Mr Sheldrake.

1323
01:54:59,393 --> 01:55:01,966
Leaving his wife? Yeah.
I'm very happy for you.

1324
01:55:02,104 --> 01:55:04,677
- I never thought he'd do it.
- I told you all along.

1325
01:55:04,815 --> 01:55:08,350
- You were wrong about Mr Sheldrake.
- I guess so.

1326
01:55:08,486 --> 01:55:10,525
You were wrong about me too.

1327
01:55:10,655 --> 01:55:13,821
What you said about those who take
and those who get took.

1328
01:55:13,950 --> 01:55:17,153
<i>Mr Sheldrake wasn't using me.
I was using him. See?</i>

1329
01:55:17,286 --> 01:55:21,783
Last month I was at desk 861 on
the 19th floor. Now I'm on the 27th floor.

1330
01:55:21,916 --> 01:55:23,956
A panelled office, three windows.

1331
01:55:24,085 --> 01:55:27,122
So it all worked out fine.
We're both getting what we wanted.

1332
01:55:27,255 --> 01:55:30,173
Yes. Will you walk me to the subway?

1333
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:35,971
No, thank you. Well, I... To tell you the
truth, I have this heavy date for tonight.

1334
01:55:39,476 --> 01:55:42,845
- Aren't you meeting Mr Sheldrake?
- No. You know how people talk.

1335
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:48,271
I decided it was best not to see each other
until everything was settled, divorcewise.

1336
01:55:48,402 --> 01:55:50,442
That's very wise.

1337
01:55:51,572 --> 01:55:54,028
- Good night, Mr Baxter.
- Good night.

1338
01:56:30,071 --> 01:56:33,440
<i>- Baxter, could you step in here a minute?
- Yes, Mr Sheldrake.</i>

1339
01:56:33,574 --> 01:56:35,614
- There you are.
- Much obliged.

1340
01:56:37,495 --> 01:56:43,332
Here are the figures on staff turnover. 37%
of females leave to get married and 22%...

1341
01:56:43,460 --> 01:56:46,414
Baxter, you work too hard.
It's New Year's Eve. Relax!

1342
01:56:46,546 --> 01:56:49,547
- Yes, sir.
- I suppose you'll be celebrating tonight.

1343
01:56:49,675 --> 01:56:51,798
- Naturally.
- I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.

1344
01:56:51,969 --> 01:56:54,045
- I finally talked her into it.
- I see.

1345
01:56:54,179 --> 01:56:58,557
The only thing is, I'm staying at the
Athletic Club and it's strictly stag, so...

1346
01:56:58,684 --> 01:57:00,807
If you don't mind?

1347
01:57:01,604 --> 01:57:05,139
- Don't mind what?
- You know my key to your apartment?

1348
01:57:05,274 --> 01:57:08,525
When we had that little scare
about Miss Kubelik...

1349
01:57:08,653 --> 01:57:12,651
...I threw it out the window of the train.
- Very clever.

1350
01:57:12,782 --> 01:57:15,071
So now I'll have to borrow your key.

1351
01:57:16,578 --> 01:57:19,413
- Sorry, Mr Sheldrake.
- What do you mean, sorry?

1352
01:57:19,539 --> 01:57:21,947
You're not bringing anybody
to my apartment.

1353
01:57:22,084 --> 01:57:26,461
- It's not just anybody. It's Miss Kubelik.
- Especially not Miss Kubelik.

1354
01:57:26,588 --> 01:57:29,792
- How's that again?
- No key.

1355
01:57:31,677 --> 01:57:36,304
Baxter, I picked you for my team because
I thought you were a bright young man.

1356
01:57:36,432 --> 01:57:39,883
Do you realise what you're doing?
Not to me, but to yourself?

1357
01:57:40,019 --> 01:57:43,388
Normally it takes years
to work your way up to the 27th floor.

1358
01:57:43,523 --> 01:57:46,559
But it only takes 30 seconds
to be out on the street again.

1359
01:57:46,693 --> 01:57:49,266
- You dig?
- I dig.

1360
01:57:50,446 --> 01:57:52,486
So what's it going to be?

1361
01:57:59,289 --> 01:58:02,374
- Now you're being bright.
- Thank you, sir.

1362
01:58:19,810 --> 01:58:22,515
- Baxter, you gave me the wrong key.
- No, I didn't.

1363
01:58:22,647 --> 01:58:25,316
But this is the key
to the executive washroom.

1364
01:58:25,441 --> 01:58:29,226
That's right. I won't be needing it
because I'm all washed up around here.

1365
01:58:29,362 --> 01:58:32,778
- What's gotten into you?
- Just following doctor's orders.

1366
01:58:32,908 --> 01:58:37,155
<i>I've decided to become a mensch.
Know what that means? A human being.</i>

1367
01:58:37,287 --> 01:58:41,237
- Now hold on, Baxter.
- The old payola won't work any more.

1368
01:58:41,375 --> 01:58:43,414
Goodbye, Mr Sheldrake.

1369
01:59:19,039 --> 01:59:22,989
- We're having a party and ran out of ice.
- Sure, Doc.

1370
01:59:23,127 --> 01:59:25,250
How come you're alone
on New Year's Eve?

1371
01:59:25,379 --> 01:59:27,336
Well, I got things to do.

1372
01:59:27,465 --> 01:59:31,676
- What's this? You're packing?
- Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.

1373
01:59:31,802 --> 01:59:33,676
Where are you moving to?

1374
01:59:33,804 --> 01:59:36,841
I don't know. All I know is
I gotta get outta this place.

1375
01:59:36,974 --> 01:59:39,014
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

1376
01:59:39,143 --> 01:59:43,889
Me? Oh, my body. Don't worry, it'll go to
the university, Doc. I'll put it in writing.

1377
01:59:44,023 --> 01:59:47,227
- Could you use some champagne?
- Booze we don't need.

1378
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:49,187
Say, why don't you join us?

1379
01:59:49,321 --> 01:59:54,315
We got two brain surgeons, a proctologist
and three nurses from Bellevue.

1380
01:59:54,451 --> 01:59:56,408
No, thanks. I don't feel like it.

1381
01:59:56,537 --> 02:00:00,784
In case I don't see you again, how much
do I owe you for taking care of that girl?

1382
02:00:00,916 --> 02:00:04,784
Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor.
I did it as a neighbour.

1383
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:07,590
By the way, whatever happened to her?

1384
02:00:08,883 --> 02:00:11,884
You know me with girls.
Easy come, easy go.

1385
02:00:12,011 --> 02:00:14,681
- Goodbye, Doc.
- Happy New Year.

1386
02:00:58,017 --> 02:01:00,473
Sorry I took so long
on the phone. We're all set.

1387
02:01:00,604 --> 02:01:03,011
- For what?
- I rented a car. It'll be here at one.

1388
02:01:03,148 --> 02:01:06,019
- We're driving to Atlantic City.
- Atlantic City?

1389
02:01:06,151 --> 02:01:10,694
I know it's a drag, but you can't find
a hotel room in town on New Year's Eve.

1390
02:01:11,740 --> 02:01:14,611
Ring out the old year, ring in the new.

1391
02:01:14,743 --> 02:01:16,950
Ring-a-ding-ding.

1392
02:01:17,454 --> 02:01:20,824
I didn't plan it this way. It's Baxter's fault.

1393
02:01:20,958 --> 02:01:21,954
Baxter?

1394
02:01:22,084 --> 02:01:25,619
He wouldn't give me
the key to the apartment.

1395
02:01:25,755 --> 02:01:28,328
- He wouldn't?
- No. He just walked out on me. Quit.

1396
02:01:28,466 --> 02:01:31,502
Threw that big, fat job right in my face.

1397
02:01:32,929 --> 02:01:37,009
- The nerve.
- The little punk. After all I did for him.

1398
02:01:37,142 --> 02:01:41,519
Said I couldn't bring anybody to the
apartment, especially not Miss Kubelik.

1399
02:01:41,646 --> 02:01:44,434
What's he got against you, anyway?

1400
02:01:44,566 --> 02:01:50,439
I don't know. I guess that's the way
it crumbles, cookiewise.

1401
02:01:52,491 --> 02:01:54,947
What are you talking about?

1402
02:01:55,953 --> 02:01:59,369
I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.

1403
02:02:04,378 --> 02:02:09,456
<i>¶ Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

1404
02:02:09,592 --> 02:02:14,504
<i>¶ And never brought to mind...</i>

1405
02:02:15,849 --> 02:02:17,888
Happy New Year, Fran.

1406
02:02:19,978 --> 02:02:24,356
<i>¶ And days of auld lang syne</i>

1407
02:02:25,234 --> 02:02:30,394
<i>¶ For auld lang syne, my dear</i>

1408
02:02:30,531 --> 02:02:35,573
<i>¶ For auld lang syne</i>

1409
02:02:35,703 --> 02:02:40,863
<i>¶ We'll drink a cup of kindness yet</i>

1410
02:02:41,083 --> 02:02:46,671
<i>¶ For auld lang syne</i>

1411
02:02:58,435 --> 02:03:00,475
Fran?

1412
02:03:01,772 --> 02:03:03,811
Where are you, Fran?

1413
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:23,999
Mr Baxter!

1414
02:03:24,295 --> 02:03:25,458
Mr Baxter!

1415
02:03:25,839 --> 02:03:28,840
Mr Baxter! Mr Baxter!

1416
02:03:31,845 --> 02:03:33,173
Oh!

1417
02:03:33,305 --> 02:03:36,425
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1418
02:03:36,558 --> 02:03:39,014
Are you sure? How's your knee?

1419
02:03:39,770 --> 02:03:41,809
I'm fine all over.

1420
02:03:43,857 --> 02:03:47,273
- Mind if I come in?
- Of course not.

1421
02:03:51,032 --> 02:03:53,071
Let me get another glass.

1422
02:03:56,037 --> 02:03:58,160
- Where are you going?
- Who knows?

1423
02:03:58,289 --> 02:04:01,623
Another neighbourhood,
another town, another job.

1424
02:04:01,751 --> 02:04:04,076
I'm on my own.

1425
02:04:04,212 --> 02:04:06,252
That's funny. So am I.

1426
02:04:07,465 --> 02:04:09,754
What'd you do with the cards?

1427

In there.

1428

What about Mr Sheldrake?

1429
02:04:25,443 --> 02:04:28,527
I'm gonna send him
a fruitcake every Christmas.

Cut.

02:04:34,702 --> 02:04:36,742
I love you, Miss Kubelik.

Queen.

Shut up and deal.
