2
00:01:19,687 --> 00:01:22,724
I only ever met one man
I wouldn't want to fight.

3
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:26,362
- I can't stop that.
- Get out of here, you useless tit!

4
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:29,399
When I met him, he was already
the best cut man in the business.

5
00:01:29,527 --> 00:01:33,918
Started training and managing in the
'60s, but he never lost his gift.

6
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:46,443
- Let me have a look at him.
- He's fine.

7
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:50,282
He ain't if you don't stop this
bleeding. l'II give you one round.

8
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:55,165
- Seconds up. Let's go.
- What do we do?

9
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:58,205
You let him hit you.

10
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,679
Sometimes there's
just nothing you can do.

11
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,958
Cut's too wide,
too close to the bone,

12
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,721
maybe you got a severed vein

13
00:02:09,847 --> 00:02:12,884
or you just can'tget
the coagulant deep enough.

14
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:16,281
There are all kinds of combinations

15
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:19,405
you come up against down
in the different layers of meat.

16
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:22,639
And Frankie
knew howto work every one.

17
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:49,165
People love violence.

18
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:52,319
They'll slow down at a car wreck
to check for bodies.

19
00:02:52,487 --> 00:02:56,719
Same people claim to love boxing,
they got no idea what it is.

20
00:02:57,527 --> 00:03:01,520
Boxing is about respect.
Getting it for yourself

21
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:05,196
and taking it away
from the other guy.

22
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:11,403
- l'll warm up the car.
- Mr. Dunn?

23
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:14,917
- I owe you money?
- No, sir.

24
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:18,483
- I know your mama?
- I don't rightly know, sir.

25
00:03:18,607 --> 00:03:21,679
- Then what is it you want?
- I was on the undercard.

26
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:26,642
- I won my fight. Maggie Fitzgerald.
- What's up?

27
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,480
- Did you happen to see it?
- Nope.

28
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:32,758
I did pretty good. Thought you
might be interested in training me.

29
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:35,879
- I don'ttrain girls.
- Maybe you should.

30
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,885
People see me fight
say I'm prettytough.

31
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:42,363
Girlie, tough ain't enough!

32
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:57,447
It's a mistake.

33
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,796
Car should be able to back up,
Frankie.

34
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:06,959
Just push, will you?

35
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:09,999
- What did Hogan want?
- Offered us a title shot.

36
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,204
- About time.
- I turned him down flat.

37
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:16,359
Two or three more fights
and you'll be ready.

38
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:24,365
Been two or three more fights
for a long time now, Frankie.

39
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:29,163
You get one shot at the title,
you lose it, it may not come again.

40
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:33,240
Now, two orthree more fights
and we'll be ready.

41
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,001
Whatever you say.

42
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,523
Frankie liked to say
that boxing is an unnatural act,

43
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:43,759
that everything
in boxing is backwards.

44
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:49,644
Sometimes, best way
to deliver a punch is step back.

45
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:03,123
Do Your best, Lord, protect Kathy.

46
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:06,842
Annie too.

47
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:09,037
Other than that

48
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:12,637
you know what I want,
there's no use me repeating myself.

49
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:16,521
But step back too far,
you ain't fighting at all.

50
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:40,562
- Father, that was a great sermon!
- What's confusing you this week?

51
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:43,326
The same old one.
God, three God thing.

52
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:46,484
Most people figure out by
kindergarten it's about faith.

53
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:50,122
Is it like Snap, Crackle and Pop
all rolled up in one big box?

54
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:55,002
You're standing outside my church
comparing God to Rice Krispies?

55
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:58,876
You come to mess only to wind me up.
It won't happen this morning.

56
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:01,043
- I'm confused.
- No.

57
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,806
- Yes, I'm.
- There's one God.

58
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:07,602
- Anything else? Because I'm busy.
- What about the Holy Ghost?

59
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,036
- He's an expression of God's love.
- And Jesus?

60
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:14,240
- Son of God. Don't play stupid!
- Does that make him a demigod?

61
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:17,359
There are no demigods,
you fucking pagan!

62
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,723
- Did you write your daughter?
- Absolutely.

63
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:29,796
You're lying to a priest. Take a day
off, don't come to mass tomorrow.

64
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:43,000
They'd say the most important thing
a fighter can have is heart.

65
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:47,399
Frankie'd say: "Show me a fighter
who's nothing but heart

66
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:50,519
and l'll show you
a man waiting for a beating!"

67
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:01,796
I think I only ever met one fighter
who was all heart.

68
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:06,916
My name's Dangerous Dillard
Fightin' Flippo Bam-Bam Barch

69
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:09,880
out of Broward County, Texas.

70
00:07:10,607 --> 00:07:13,599
Danger showed up
couple of years back.

71
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:19,156
He'd come visiting L.A. with Ervel,
his mama's new boyfriend.

72
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:24,156
Apparently Ervel got lost
and ended up back in Texas.

73
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:29,565
Danger looked for him for about
a week before he introduced himself.

74
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:36,117
You know,
I've got nothing against niggers.

75
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:43,997
- That's nice to hear.
- Lotsa people where I come from does

76
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:48,922
but my mama taught me not to cause
hurt to no man, niggers or not.

77
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:52,084
You got a nice mama.
Anything else I can do for you?

78
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:56,763
Just one of those questions you ask,
but Danger wanted to answer.

79
00:07:56,887 --> 00:08:00,675
I'd like to become the
Welterweight Champion ofthe world.

80
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:07,443
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns

81
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:11,600
to fight me for the Welterweight
Championship of the whole world!

82
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:17,120
You ain't even ranked! You gotta have
at least one fight to be ranked!

83
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:20,882
- l'll fight any man, anytime!
- You a bad man, huh?

84
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:25,086
- Go a round with me.
- Shawrelle.

85
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:32,159
Leave him alone.
Danger, go on back to training.

86
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:36,165
Will do, Mister Scrap.

87
00:08:37,927 --> 00:08:40,885
Them some nice tights, Danger.

88
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:46,041
- I'II give you that ass-whuppin'.
- Those pants look pretty on you.

89
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:51,036
Shawrelle Berry had a left hook
that would move a tank,

90
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:54,603
but he had a heart
the size of a split pea.

91
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:58,203
Frankie bought the Hit Pit
from BobbyMalone 17 years ago.

92
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:01,922
Bobby wanted to move to Florida
and Frankie wanted some security.

93
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:05,238
Bobby died while he was packing.

94
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:08,803
Frankie found out
most gyms lose money.

95
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:12,158
I told you I didn't want
Danger working out here anymore.

96
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:15,563
- He ain't hurting nothing.
- He's hurting me.

97
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:18,997
Breaking my heart watching him punch
the air like it's gonna punch back.

98
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:23,439
How many times have I got
to tell you that bleach is bleach?

99
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:27,162
You don't have to buy
the expensive stuff.

100
00:09:27,287 --> 00:09:30,996
- It smells better.
- Bleach smells like bleach!

101
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,359
Nice fight. People are talking.

102
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:23,846
- What kind of language is that?
- What do you want?

103
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:29,246
You got a fighter
not talking to another manager.

104
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:34,401
- Not talking to another manager?
- And not just any manager...

105
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:39,880
...Mickey Mack.
- You came in here to tell me

106
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,919
that Big Willie
is not talking to Mickey Mack.

107
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:48,525
- Not a word. Neither one of them.
- I'm trying to read here.

108
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:51,440
If you think that's more important.

109
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:56,762
- Who's your new girl?
- What?

110
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:13,360
If she keeps hitting it like that
she gonna break her wrists.

111
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:25,002
You're wasting your time,
I told you I don't train girls.

112
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:28,915
- Thought you might change your mind.
- Dozens oftrainers train girls.

113
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:32,801
- You won't have trouble finding one.
- You'll do fine, boss.

114
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:36,596
I'm not your boss
and don'tyou be calling me that.

115
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,719
- You ready to work?
- Anytime.

116
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:43,039
If I stop calling you boss,
will you train me?

117
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:47,445
Then I might as well
keep calling you it.

118
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:50,525
She came from Southwestern Missouri,

119
00:11:50,647 --> 00:11:54,560
the hills outside the scratch-ass
Ozark town of Theodosia,

120
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:59,482
set in the trees somewhere
between nowhere and goodbye.

121
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:03,401
She grew up knowing one thing:
she was trash.

122
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:18,320
It's for my dog.

123
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:23,845
She'd come 1800 miles, but Theodosia
was stil ljust over the hill.

124
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:44,166
- Working the bag, boss.
- Not your boss.

125
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:46,960
And that bag's working you!

126
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:04,042
- Give her her money back.
- You sure?

127
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:07,921
- How much did she pay?
- Six months.

128
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,683
- No, I'll give it back.
- Don't be a smart ass!

129
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:16,600
Woman thinks I'll throw away
six months' worth of dues

130
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:20,606
just to get rid of her, she's out of
her mind. But don't encourage her.

131
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:24,678
And what's Danger doing out there?
What's he looking at?

132
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:34,040
- Looks like a bottle of water.
- He paid his dues?

133
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:38,519
Boy can't afford pants,
want him to pay dues?

134
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,724
Get out of my office!

135
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:37,725
Can't think of it as a bag.

136
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:45,278
I'm not a trainer, but I can
show you this, if you'd like.

137
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:48,399
Appreciate any help I can get.

138
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:53,839
You want to think of it as a man.
He's constantly moving.

139
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:58,279
He's moving towards you, around you,
away from you. All right?

140
00:14:58,407 --> 00:15:02,844
Don't hit him when he's coming
towards you or he'll push you back,

141
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:06,357
he'll smotheryour punches,
take your balance, right?

142
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:09,957
Watch him carefully, keep rotating
and keep your head moving

143
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:14,000
and keep one shoulder back so
you're ready to fire a powershot.

144
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:18,405
Go ahead, good. Keep rotating,
keep moving. That's it.

145
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:23,120
Keep that chin tucked in.

146
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:29,760
- Like that?
- Keep moving. Give it a few shots.

147
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,441
Tuck that chin in.

148
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:41,196
You get this down, we'll put you
on the speed bag.

149
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:47,005
You do have a speed bag.

150
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:59,086
l'll borrow it,
till I can buy my own.

151
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:02,085
- All right. You go home now.
- l'll walk out with you?

152
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:04,721
I am home. Want to see?

153
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:20,643
Would it bother you much
if I worked a little longer?

154
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:24,999
Just pull the door closed
when you leave.

155
00:16:43,407 --> 00:16:45,967
lf there's magic in boxing

156
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:49,722
it's the magic of fighting battles
beyond endurance,

157
00:16:49,847 --> 00:16:54,398
beyond cracked ribs, ruptured
kidneys and detached retinas.

158
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:09,559
It's the magic of risking everything
fora dream that nobody sees butyou.

159
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:47,881
I think I found somebody
you can beat.

160
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:56,278
- I don't fight women.
- It's perfect. You know why?

161
00:17:56,407 --> 00:18:00,923
You could fight to him
and then you could kiss to him.

162
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:04,517
- Then fight one more time.
- That's like poetry!

163
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:07,957
- It's like poetry.
- You been reading and shit.

164
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,362
That's a girl, man?

165
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:14,799
Look at her little titties.
They're like mosquito bites!

166
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:19,279
- That's barely even a mouthful.
- Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

167
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:22,205
Spent so much time face down,
I thought the canvas had titties!

168
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:31,125
Canvas has titties!
Look at me! I'm Shawrelle!

169
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:42,199
Just humping the canvas,
humping the floor.

170
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:46,957
Come on, bro. The floor
having titties, that's funny!

171
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:50,636
Shut up! Whatyou laughing at?

172
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:53,327
Hold the bag!

173
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:00,516
When they start making
those tights for men, Flippy?

174
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:06,039
That's enough for today.

175
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:11,558
- l'll give you a rubdown.
- I can't.

176
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:14,360
My middle one's got a piano lesson.
I told Grace I'd drive her.

177
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,763
- Something wrong with Grace's car?
- She hates that car.

178
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,118
Wants the old one back,
but the dealer already got a buyer.

179
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:24,842
- I should talk to the dealer.
- I'd appreciate that.

180
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:40,439
The man's a rubdown whore
and today he doesn't want one?

181
00:19:40,607 --> 00:19:43,280
You ever do anywork around here?

182
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:46,678
Not my job I'd worry about,
if I was you.

183
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,684
Little girl seems to be coming along.

184
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:56,766
It's almost like
somebody's been helping her.

185
00:19:56,927 --> 00:20:01,443
She might just be a natural.
Looks like she's got something.

186
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:06,644
She's got my speed bag,
that's what she's got!

187
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:10,679
I wonder how she got that!

188
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:23,324
- I need that speed bag back.
- That bag?

189
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:27,406
- This bag?
- People will think I'm training you.

190
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:30,843
- Is that such a bad thing, boss?
- Yes, it is.

191
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:34,642
Every time you touch it,
you're losing my business out here.

192
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,839
I gotta agree,
I am embarrassing myself.

193
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:41,846
I can't just lend it to anybody.

194
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:52,126
You seem like a nice girl.
Can I give you some advice?

195
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:55,842
- I'd appreciate that.
- You'll find a trainer

196
00:20:55,967 --> 00:21:00,483
that will want to train a girl.
It's the latest freak show out there!

197
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:04,162
But they'll be wasting your time
because you're too old.

198
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:07,239
I don't feel that old.

199
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:10,843
Neither do I, but you don't see me
fighting 21-year-olds, do you?

200
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:14,443
Takes about four years
to train a fighter.

201
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:19,920
- How old are you?
- 31 until my next birthday.

202
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:25,883
You wouldn't start training to be
a ballerina at 31, would you?

203
00:21:26,007 --> 00:21:29,636
- Already been working for 3 years.
- And you can't hit a speed bag?

204
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:33,362
- What kind of training is that?
- I've never had any, boss.

205
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:38,840
I hate to say it, but it shows.
Somebody's got to be honest with you.

206
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:42,124
I hate to be the one
to tell you the truth.

207
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:47,082
Sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.

208
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:53,839
- You're not gonna cry now, are you?
- No, sir.

209
00:21:57,247 --> 00:22:02,526
- Keep the goddamn thing.
- No, you need it.

210
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:07,675
No, take the bag. I haven't seen it
in 20 years anyway.

211
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:11,959
I've had three since then.
Just enjoy it, will you?

212
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:16,638
- I'll borrow it till I buy my own.
- Don't lose it.

213
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:29,679
I know, Hogan. Your guy's the champ,
so we don't split fifties.

214
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,765
But if I don't see forty percent...

215
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:36,436
Call me back when it's 60-40
or don't call me back at all.

216
00:22:48,487 --> 00:22:52,036
- Is something wrong?
- Sorry to come like this.

217
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:55,557
- You don't like people dropping in.
- You're not people, Willie.

218
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:59,521
- You're welcome anytime. Come on in.
- Thank you for getting the car back.

219
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:05,916
Paying an extra 1000 dollars
for your own car is not a favor.

220
00:23:06,047 --> 00:23:09,198
- Grace cried when she saw it.
- Really?

221
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:12,838
I also needed to talk with you
about business.

222
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:16,886
I justtalked with Hogan,
we're all set for September.

223
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:20,756
- Everything but the split.
- I gotta leave you, Frankie.

224
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:31,525
- The title is just two fights away.
- It ain't that.

225
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:34,764
It's like you said, I got one shot.

226
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:37,760
lf I win, I gotta make
as much as I can, while I can.

227
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:41,476
I need somebody in the action
who can make things happen.

228
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:45,240
And I gotta make the change
before the fight.

229
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:48,564
Only way this guy say he'd take me
is if he took me to the title.

230
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:52,646
So I get you the title fight
and this guy takes you there?

231
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:56,077
Only way he'd do it.
I'm sorry, Frankie.

232
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:59,995
I know how long
you've been waiting on a title.

233
00:24:01,727 --> 00:24:05,197
Mickey Mack's a business man.
He can't teach you nothing.

234
00:24:06,407 --> 00:24:09,638
You already taught me
everything I need to know.

235
00:24:16,607 --> 00:24:19,963
There's some things that people
just don't want to hear.

236
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:34,762
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns

237
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:38,766
to fight me for the Welterweight
Championship of the whole world!

238
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:41,521
I'm wearing these mitts for a reason.

239
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:44,679
Just working on my footwork,
Mist' Scrap.

240
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:49,239
Danger, you throw a punch
or get the hell out ofthis gym.

241
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,558
While you thinking about that punch,
I'll be right back.

242
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:02,759
I'm thinking how I'm gonna
hit it hard for you, Mist' Scrap!

243
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:12,198
No one had the heart to tell Danger
that Hearns had retired years ago.

244
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:24,923
I heard about Willie.
That's cold, man, that's dead cold.

245
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:28,517
It wouldn't be so bad
if you weren't so damn old.

246
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:31,719
At least I can see through both eyes.

247
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:34,276
Didn't do you a lot of good though,
did it?

248
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:39,805
I've got the gym. Don't need
to be training fighters at my age.

249
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:46,317
- Willie tell you why?
- Mickey's got the connections.

250
00:25:46,487 --> 00:25:49,684
It ain't about connections.
It's about you not believing in him.

251
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:54,477
I stuck with him for eight years.
How's that for not believing in him?

252
00:25:54,647 --> 00:25:57,923
You could've got him a title fight
two years ago, he knew that.

253
00:25:58,087 --> 00:26:00,476
I'm amazed he stayed around
this long.

254
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:03,599
Getting there and taking home
the belt are two different things.

255
00:26:03,727 --> 00:26:07,766
What was I supposed to do? Put him
in over his head, not protect him?

256
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:11,317
You were protecting him
from the championship!

257
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:15,765
- Now it makes sense.
- Whatabout you, Scrap?

258
00:26:15,887 --> 00:26:19,641
What did your manager do? You were
a good fighter, better than Willie.

259
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:23,083
He get you a title fight or did
he bust you out banging your head

260
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,438
against other people's fists,
until you lost your eye?

261
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:31,317
I had my shot. I went out swinging
and no man can say I didn't.

262
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:34,957
I remember. Excuse me
if I didn't want my fighter

263
00:26:35,087 --> 00:26:38,636
spending the second half ofhis life
cleaning up other people's spit.

264
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:43,795
Right, you're the smart one.
You're the one learning Greek.

265
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:47,840
- It's Gaelic.
- You protected yourself

266
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:51,926
out of a championship fight.
How do you say that in Gaelic?

267
00:28:16,047 --> 00:28:19,403
Boxing is an unnatural act.

268
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:22,639
'Cause everything in it
is backwards.

269
00:28:24,727 --> 00:28:28,117
You want to move to the left,
you don't step left,

270
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:30,841
you push on the right toe.

271
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:34,397
To move right,
you use your left toe.

272
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:37,843
Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do,

273
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:41,004
you step into it.

274
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:43,761
So Big Willie comes back.
Oh, my God!

275
00:28:43,887 --> 00:28:47,004
He hits the champ with a right hand
and the champ is down.

276
00:28:47,127 --> 00:28:51,359
The Refis into the count
and Big Willie Jones

277
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:55,366
is the new champion ofthe world!
It's unbelievable!

278
00:28:55,487 --> 00:28:59,924
There you have it, folks,
a new champion!

279
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:04,839
Everything in boxing is backwards.

280
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:22,762
- Wanta cheeseburger?
- You bought me a cheeseburger?

281
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:25,560
I never seen you buy anybody
a cheeseburger.

282
00:29:25,687 --> 00:29:28,679
I couldn't eat it and I ordered it.
You want it?

283
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:31,799
I guess the planet
can go back to spinning!

284
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:35,845
- You watch the fight?
- Yeah, I watched it.

285
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,606
Willie did good.

286
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:43,278
- That's what you got to say?
- He won, didn't he? He did good.

287
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:48,921
I see you been working on yourself,
learning to open up. Good work.

288
00:29:49,047 --> 00:29:52,676
- You watch it?
- Yeah, I got HBO.

289
00:29:54,007 --> 00:29:56,475
How can you afford HBO?

290
00:29:56,607 --> 00:29:59,440
How long have I been telling you
to save your money?

291
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:05,039
Since I fought Louis "Typhoon"
Johnson in Tupelo, Mississippi.

292
00:30:05,207 --> 00:30:09,325
- That true?
- Manager ran off

293
00:30:09,447 --> 00:30:13,042
and left you and me to hitch home,
don't you remember nothing?

294
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:16,477
I remember walking halfway,
thinking I was gonna be lynched.

295
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:20,764
I remember you leaving me pissing
behind that gas station.

296
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:24,846
I gota ride. The guy took off
before I hardly closed the door.

297
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:27,481
I had to walk back two miles.

298
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:30,440
Your conscience got
the better of you, that's what.

299
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:37,357
- What's that?
- It's her birthday.

300
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:01,879
You're not breathing right,
that's why you're panting.

301
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:04,999
So, it's your birthday, huh?

302
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:09,484
- How old does that make you?
- I'm 32, Mr. Dunn.

303
00:31:10,647 --> 00:31:14,322
I'm here celebrating the fact that
I spent another year waitressing

304
00:31:14,447 --> 00:31:17,598
which is what I've been doing
since 13. And according to you

305
00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:20,799
I'll be 37 before
I can even throw a decent punch

306
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:23,999
which after working this speed bag
for a month and getting nowhere

307
00:31:24,127 --> 00:31:28,166
I now realize may be
God's simple truth. Other truth is

308
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:31,040
my brother's in prison,
my sister cheats on welfare

309
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:33,840
by pretending one ofher babies
is still alive, my dad is dead

310
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:36,640
and my mama weighs 312 pounds.
If I was thinking straight

311
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:39,565
I'd go back home,
find a used trailer,

312
00:31:39,687 --> 00:31:42,281
buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

313
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:45,444
Problem is, this is the only thing
I ever felt good doing.

314
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:49,319
If I'm too old for this,
then I got nothing.

315
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:55,042
- That enough truth to suit you?
- This your speed bag?

316
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:58,842
Put yours behind the counter.
Wish I could say I wore it out.

317
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:03,119
Hold it.

318
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:06,557
Il'll show you a few things
and then we'll get you a trainer.

319
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:10,839
- No, sorry.
- You're in a position to negotiate?

320
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:14,158
Yes, sir. Because I know if you train
me right, I'm going to be a champ.

321
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:19,399
- I seen you looking at me.
- Out of pity.

322
00:32:19,527 --> 00:32:23,156
Don't you say that if it ain't true!

323
00:32:24,487 --> 00:32:29,607
I want a trainer. I don't want
charity, and I don't want favors!

324
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:36,764
lf you're not interested,
then I got more celebrating to do.

325
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,085
What the hell are you doing?

326
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:53,039
- If I'm going to take you on...
- You won't never regret it.

327
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:58,287
- Listen to me. If I take you on...
- I promise l'll work so hard.

328
00:32:58,447 --> 00:33:04,204
- This is a mistake already.
- I'm listening, boss.

329
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:09,395
If I take you on, you don't say
anything, you don't question me.

330
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:13,446
You don't ask "Why?". You don't say
anything except "Yes, Frankie".

331
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:16,599
And I'm going to try to forget
the fact that you're a girl.

332
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:20,481
- It's all I ask.
- Don't cry if you get hurt.

333
00:33:20,647 --> 00:33:23,115
- All right.
- We got a deal.

334
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:27,200
No, not quite.
I'll teach you how to fight

335
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:30,160
then we'll get you a manager
and I'm off down the road.

336
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:33,524
- I hate to argue with you...
- That's how we're doing it.

337
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:37,560
I teach you and you go off
and make a million dollars.

338
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:40,764
I don't care. Get your teeth
knocked out, I don't care.

339
00:33:40,887 --> 00:33:45,278
I don't want to hear about it,
that's the only way I'll do it.

340
00:33:57,007 --> 00:34:00,556
One of the things I've noticed
is you never move your feet.

341
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:05,886
You've got to move your feet,
that's the best thing l'll teach you.

342
00:34:06,047 --> 00:34:11,280
Here's what you do.
Bend your knees a little bit.

343
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:15,201
Get in an athletic position. Look
like you're going to hit something.

344
00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:20,200
- Move them how, boss?
- Hit the bag.

345
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:25,884
- What'd I do wrong?
- You did two things wrong.

346
00:34:26,007 --> 00:34:29,317
One is you asked a question and
two is you asked another question.

347
00:34:29,487 --> 00:34:33,480
What I want you to do
it's not about hitting it hard,

348
00:34:33,647 --> 00:34:37,242
it's how good you hit it.
So, watch me.

349
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:42,316
You can count with me if you want. On
a one count, I hit through the bag.

350
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:46,076
- Can you show me that again?
- Just say "one", please.

351
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:52,879
Just say "one". That's good.

352
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:57,558
Then I move over to my right foot.
My weight is shifting to my right foot.

353
00:34:57,727 --> 00:35:02,403
Then I hit it with the back of my
hand, like I'm using an ice pick.

354
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:05,519
Then I come over,
I shift to my left foot

355
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:10,641
and I hit it with my right hand.
Ice pick movement again

356
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:13,804
and I come over on my right foot,
and hit it right.

357
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:17,921
Don't watch anything but my feet.

358
00:35:29,287 --> 00:35:31,517
Keep on training.

359
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:04,916
You show them how to stand, keep
their legs under their shoulders.

360
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:16,686
To make a fighter, you got
to strip them down to bare wood.

361
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:19,640
Rest when you're dead. Come here.

362
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,883
You can't just tell them
to forget everything you know

363
00:36:27,007 --> 00:36:30,124
because you got to make them
forget it in their bones.

364
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:37,446
Make them so tired they only
listen to you, only hear your voice,

365
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:40,718
only do what you say
and nothing else.

366
00:36:40,847 --> 00:36:43,361
Move your feetaround.

367
00:36:57,607 --> 00:37:01,202
Show them how to keep their balance
and take it away from the other guy.

368
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:11,919
How to generate momentum
off your right toe

369
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:15,838
and how to flex your knees
when you fire a jab.

370
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:25,283
How to fight backing up, so the other
guy doesn't want to come after you.

371
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:30,884
Then you got to show them all
over again. Over and over and over.

372
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:34,079
Till they think
they were born that way.

373
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:44,078
Okay. That's enough for today.
Good work.

374
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:50,399
Think I'm ready for a fight, boss?

375
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:14,882
Come here.

376
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:21,925
- You're not breathing.
- Hate to disagree with you.

377
00:38:22,047 --> 00:38:25,164
Every time you get under pressure,
you're holding your breath.

378
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:28,518
- Stop doing that.
- Okay.

379
00:38:28,647 --> 00:38:33,243
But other than that, I'm doing good,
right? I mean, for a girl.

380
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:35,961
I don't train girls.

381
00:38:37,287 --> 00:38:42,077
- Think I'm ready for a fight?
- We'll get a manager.

382
00:38:42,207 --> 00:38:45,563
I'd like to but you've been
keeping me too busy.

383
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:55,564
- Got any family, boss?
- What?

384
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:01,079
You been spending all this time with
me. I didn't know if you had any.

385
00:39:05,327 --> 00:39:09,240
- I've got a daughter, Katy.
- That's family.

386
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:13,798
- We're not exactly close.
- How much she weigh?

387
00:39:16,447 --> 00:39:19,484
Trouble in my family
comes by the pound.

388
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:27,446
Not very big.
Used to be very athletic

389
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:30,365
I don't know if she kept it up.

390
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:40,840
So, what do you think?
I ready for a fight?

391
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,799
Come here for a minute, will you?

392
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:57,085
I need to see you
in the back for a minute.

393
00:39:57,247 --> 00:40:01,479
Sally is a good manager,
has a couple of Golden Gloves boys.

394
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:05,486
- Looking for a girl, Sally?
- Looking for a good one.

395
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:08,684
Well, see, there you go.

396
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:13,042
Nice working with you, girlie.

397
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,523
- What'd you want?
- Nothing.

398
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:23,003
I been watching you work,
you got a hell of a left.

399
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:29,119
You want to give this a try,
see if it's a fit?

400
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:38,405
I think you're ready for a fight.

401
00:40:52,287 --> 00:40:55,438
What am I doing wrong? Every time
I get inside, she's on me.

402
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:59,560
- You're doing great. Keep punching.
- I ain't doing great. I'm losing.

403
00:40:59,727 --> 00:41:02,878
You're wearing herdown.

404
00:41:23,007 --> 00:41:27,285
- Nice night, ain't it?
- Jesus Christ!

405
00:41:27,407 --> 00:41:32,686
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.
Hell of a fighter. 11-0.

406
00:41:33,087 --> 00:41:35,647
Keep your left up.

407
00:41:39,687 --> 00:41:42,599
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

408
00:41:42,727 --> 00:41:45,719
He's got Joey Adagio,
lightweight champ?

409
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,123
Your left!

410
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:52,484
Wouldn't have been my choice
for a first fight,

411
00:41:52,607 --> 00:41:56,122
but Sally's a good manager.
He must think she can take her.

412
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:59,364
Keep your left up!

413
00:41:59,487 --> 00:42:02,479
You think she can hear you
from back here?

414
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:13,561
If Maggie loses, it wouldn't
mean anything to Sally.

415
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:17,839
Might even help him.
Lonnie's girl gets another win,

416
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:21,562
Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight
fight Joey Adagio for the title.

417
00:42:21,687 --> 00:42:24,918
Sally's trying to set a fight
with Adagio?

418
00:42:25,047 --> 00:42:28,323
What do I know? I just come
because I enjoy the fights.

419
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,196
Break!

420
00:42:34,727 --> 00:42:37,924
- Come here.
- Getover here!

421
00:42:38,047 --> 00:42:40,925
You're dropping your left hand.
Quit dropping your left hand.

422
00:42:41,047 --> 00:42:44,517
- You mind if I talk to my fighter?
- You're doing a hell of a job.

423
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:47,923
Is this the way
you advise your lightweight?

424
00:42:48,047 --> 00:42:51,517
- Dunn, what are you doing?
- I'm talking. What are you doing?

425
00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:54,485
- Is this your fighter?
- It's my fighter!

426
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:58,560
- It ain't fitting very well.
- Fine. You take her.

427
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,759
- She can't fight worth a shit!
- What's going on?

428
00:43:01,887 --> 00:43:04,481
I was late. Sally was subbing for me.

429
00:43:04,647 --> 00:43:06,956
Is this your fighter?

430
00:43:09,207 --> 00:43:13,246
- Yes. This is my fighter.
- You got ten seconds.

431
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:16,205
I keep holding my left up, then I
throw a punch and it keeps dropping.

432
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,966
- Let it drop.
- That'd be a lot easier.

433
00:43:19,087 --> 00:43:22,636
She thinks she knows you. Every time
you drop itshe comes over the top.

434
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:26,442
You wait for her, see?
That's all she's thinking about.

435
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:29,286
- She cocks that big right hand...
- I hear you, boss.

436
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:33,082
Step to the side and come over
with a big good night hook!

437
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:36,563
- Got it right here.
- Fight or I'm calling it.

438
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:40,959
The body knows what fighters don't,
how to protect itself.

439
00:43:41,127 --> 00:43:45,962
A neck can only twist so far.
Twist it just a hair more

440
00:43:46,087 --> 00:43:48,999
and the body says:
"l'll take it from here,

441
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:51,806
because you don't know
what you're doing."

442
00:43:54,447 --> 00:43:57,519
See the way she did that?
Sugar Ray would do that.

443
00:43:57,647 --> 00:43:59,717
Girl's gotsugar.

444
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:04,875
"Lie down, rest and we'II talk about
this when you regain your senses."

445
00:44:05,047 --> 00:44:08,039
lt's called the knockout mechanism.

446
00:44:13,087 --> 00:44:17,046
You forgot the rule.
Now, what is the rule?

447
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:21,046
- Keep my left up?
- To protect yourself at all times.

448
00:44:21,207 --> 00:44:24,995
- What is the rule?
- Protect myself at all times.

449
00:44:25,847 --> 00:44:28,759
You gave me away.
How was that protecting me?

450
00:44:30,487 --> 00:44:34,002
- It wasn't.
- It's okay.

451
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:37,443
- I'll work on my left, boss.
- Drink your water.

452
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:43,683
- Other than that, how'd I do?
- You did fine.

453
00:44:44,887 --> 00:44:48,800
- You going to leave me again?
- Never.

454
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:54,645
That place you work, do they have
homemade lemon meringue pie?

455
00:44:54,807 --> 00:44:58,163
- Sure.
- Not with the canned filling crap?

456
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:01,399
Big can, yea size.
Says "homemade" on the label.

457
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,679
- I want you to take the weekend off.
- It's only Thursday.

458
00:45:06,847 --> 00:45:11,363
- You going to argue with me?
- Know better than to do that.

459
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:16,365
All fighters
are pig-headed some way or other.

460
00:45:16,527 --> 00:45:20,440
Some part ofthem always thinks they
know better than you about something.

461
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:24,560
Can you spare a few minutes
for the lmmaculate Conception?

462
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:29,078
Truth is, even if they're wrong,

463
00:45:29,207 --> 00:45:32,882
even if that one thing
is going to be the ruin ofthem,

464
00:45:33,007 --> 00:45:36,044
if you can beat that last bit
out of them...

465
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:39,204
...then they ain't fighters at all.
- Thought I said I'd see you Monday.

466
00:45:39,327 --> 00:45:42,558
- You sure did, boss.
- That was last night.

467
00:45:42,687 --> 00:45:45,406
You said not to argue with you!

468
00:45:55,487 --> 00:45:58,718
Damn woman won't do a thing
I tell her!

469
00:45:58,847 --> 00:46:01,998
- You want my advice?
- What?

470
00:46:03,487 --> 00:46:08,117
- Where are your shoes?
- I'm airing out myfeet.

471
00:46:09,807 --> 00:46:14,005
- You got big holes in your socks.
- They're not that big.

472
00:46:16,287 --> 00:46:19,757
Didn't I give you money
for some new ones?

473
00:46:19,887 --> 00:46:24,756
These are my sleeping socks.
My feet like a little air at night.

474
00:46:25,487 --> 00:46:28,160
How come you're wearing them
in the daytime?

475
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,205
Because my daytime socks
got too many holes in them.

476
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:38,037
If I give you some more money,
you buy some new socks.

477
00:46:42,247 --> 00:46:46,001
I'd be tempted,
but I couldn't say for sure.

478
00:46:46,127 --> 00:46:49,517
Might find its way to the track!

479
00:47:05,247 --> 00:47:07,477
It's over!

480
00:47:21,887 --> 00:47:25,118
Didn't take Maggie long
to hit her stride.

481
00:47:35,207 --> 00:47:38,199
- I got the breathing thing down.
- No, you ain't breathing,

482
00:47:38,327 --> 00:47:40,716
because you're knocking them out
in the first round.

483
00:47:40,847 --> 00:47:43,805
- I thought that was the point.
- The point is to get good.

484
00:47:43,967 --> 00:47:46,959
Can't get good if you keep knocking
them out in the first round.

485
00:47:47,087 --> 00:47:49,681
How am I going to get you fights?

486
00:47:50,887 --> 00:47:53,640
Nobody wants to see
their fighter embarrassed.

487
00:47:53,767 --> 00:47:58,636
- Why am I still doing four-rounders?
- You hadn't the lungs for 6 rounds.

488
00:47:58,767 --> 00:48:01,884
I do if I keep knocking them out
in the first round.

489
00:48:05,207 --> 00:48:08,199
Frankie made her fight
one more four-rounder

490
00:48:08,327 --> 00:48:11,399
just to let her know who was boss!

491
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,636
Maggie left no doubt about it.

492
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:39,637
Her first six-rounder
didn't go quite as smooth.

493
00:49:07,767 --> 00:49:11,237
Maggie didn't knock her out
till the end of the first round.

494
00:49:11,367 --> 00:49:14,677
After that, no manager wanted
to put his fighter in with Maggie.

495
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:23,156
Frankie had to go into his pocket
to get her decent fights,

496
00:49:23,287 --> 00:49:26,484
sweetening the purse
by paying managers on the side.

497
00:49:38,407 --> 00:49:43,401
That only worked for so long, then
Frankie did something he hated doing.

498
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:46,087
He took a chance.

499
00:49:53,687 --> 00:49:57,805
He moved her up in class.
That could've been a mistake.

500
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:26,797
Break! Step back! Time!

501
00:50:40,487 --> 00:50:43,559
Give us two seconds, will you?

502
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:47,159
- Your nose is broken.
- Fix it!

503
00:50:47,287 --> 00:50:49,482
- I can't.
- You can fix it.

504
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:52,957
- I can't. I've gotto call it.
- I've seen what you can do, fix it!

505
00:50:53,127 --> 00:50:56,199
I can snap it back into place,
but I can't stop the bleeding.

506
00:50:56,327 --> 00:50:59,956
- The ring doctor's going to call it.
- Stop the blood, I can beat her.

507
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:03,437
Bite down on this.

508
00:51:21,407 --> 00:51:24,524
- Inhale.
- What?

509
00:51:24,687 --> 00:51:27,281
Breathe in!

510
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:44,840
In 20 seconds this turns into a
geyser and sprays the front raw.

511
00:51:45,007 --> 00:51:48,966
20 seconds, that's all you've got.
Now get going.

512
00:52:01,607 --> 00:52:04,360
Go to your corner!

513
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,396
Mo Cuishle.

514
00:52:32,087 --> 00:52:35,716
- Whatcha reading?
- What's she saying?

515
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:40,165
- Wants to know what you're reading.
- It's Yeats. Keep your head back.

516
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:46,115
Why don't you talk a little Yeats to
her? Show her whata treat that is.

517
00:52:47,607 --> 00:52:51,043
- When they going to get to her?
- I'm okay, Frankie.

518
00:52:52,447 --> 00:52:55,245
- What'd you learn tonight?
- Always protect myself.

519
00:52:55,407 --> 00:52:58,399
- What's the rule?
- Always protect myself.

520
00:53:04,647 --> 00:53:06,956
I'll be right here.

521
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:22,443
- How you doing?
- Me? I'm not the one who's hurt.

522
00:53:26,927 --> 00:53:30,966
- Broken nose don't hurt that much.
- Why are you telling me that?

523
00:53:32,727 --> 00:53:34,922
No reason.

524
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:39,359
But some wounds are too deep
or too close to the bone.

525
00:53:39,527 --> 00:53:43,440
No matter how hard you work at it,
you just can't stop the bleeding.

526
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:46,843
- Did you write your daughter?
- Every week.

527
00:53:48,887 --> 00:53:51,959
I've no idea
why you come to church.

528
00:54:21,527 --> 00:54:25,315
After her 12th straight knockout,
Frankie got a couple of good offers.

529
00:54:28,487 --> 00:54:31,399
The first was to fight
Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman

530
00:54:31,527 --> 00:54:34,519
for the WBA welterweight title.

531
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:40,359
Billie was a former prostitute
out of East Berlin.

532
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:44,076
Had a reputation for being
the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.

533
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:05,045
Didn't seem to matter to her that
those things could kill a person.

534
00:55:07,087 --> 00:55:09,760
And the crowds loved her.

535
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:14,799
He turned it down
without even telling her.

536
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:19,079
The next was to fight the British
champ, a girl Billie just beat.

537
00:55:21,047 --> 00:55:23,720
Not interested.

538
00:55:26,047 --> 00:55:29,119
He turned that down, too.

539
00:55:29,287 --> 00:55:32,279
That's a lot of money, boss.

540
00:55:32,407 --> 00:55:35,763
You're making money.
What are you still working here for?

541
00:55:35,887 --> 00:55:39,402
- It's a title match, right?
- Are you British?

542
00:55:39,527 --> 00:55:42,519
It's a title you can't take away.
She's got nothing to lose.

543
00:55:42,647 --> 00:55:46,765
- You got nothing to win.
- Might still be a good fight.

544
00:55:46,887 --> 00:55:50,562
I just brought you up
to welterweight.

545
00:55:50,687 --> 00:55:54,805
Too good to fight these contenders,
you'd rather fight a bullshit champ?

546
00:55:54,927 --> 00:55:57,885
Didn't notice
I was fighting any contenders.

547
00:55:58,007 --> 00:56:01,477
You can get yourself
another manager any time you want.

548
00:56:01,647 --> 00:56:05,560
If you'd learn to protect
your face a little better

549
00:56:05,687 --> 00:56:08,679
I wouldn't have
to turn down this money.

550
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:14,562
My face out there so much it's a
miracle I ain't been knocked out yet!

551
00:56:43,207 --> 00:56:47,803
You can't work here anymore tonight.
I made us a reservation.

552
00:56:48,607 --> 00:56:51,440
You might want to shower.

553
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:15,118
Here you go. Here you go.

554
00:57:15,247 --> 00:57:20,526
- What's this?
- I know what you're wishing for.

555
00:57:20,647 --> 00:57:23,286
Go on, blow!

556
00:57:33,567 --> 00:57:38,641
33 ain't so old.
I was still fighting at 39.

557
00:57:40,887 --> 00:57:43,685
Fought for 23 years.

558
00:57:46,327 --> 00:57:50,036
- How's it going, Scrap?
- Doing good, Mickey.

559
00:57:53,927 --> 00:57:56,839
- What will you have?
- Coffee.

560
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:05,362
- You two not speaking?
- Don't hardly know him.

561
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:14,677
I met Frankie
right after my 37th birthday.

562
00:58:15,807 --> 00:58:18,640
He was picking up cut work.

563
00:58:19,847 --> 00:58:22,964
He used to patch me up
when I thought it was impossible.

564
00:58:24,447 --> 00:58:28,326
- Good man to have in your corner.
- Yes, he is.

565
00:58:29,887 --> 00:58:33,800
He stayed with me
through my last fight in San Berdu.

566
00:58:33,967 --> 00:58:37,277
My manager was off
getting drunk somewhere,

567
00:58:38,487 --> 00:58:41,684
it was just Frankie and me.

568
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:46,320
I was taking a hellacious beating.

569
00:58:47,407 --> 00:58:50,843
Everybody's got a particular number
offights in them.

570
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:54,716
Nobody tells you what that number is.

571
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:57,839
Mine was a 109.

572
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,959
I just didn't want to admit it.

573
00:59:02,007 --> 00:59:06,523
Fourth round this cut opens up.

574
00:59:06,687 --> 00:59:09,645
Blood starts pouring into my eye.

575
00:59:09,807 --> 00:59:12,799
They should've stopped the fight,

576
00:59:12,927 --> 00:59:17,045
but I was a black man in San Berdu,
blood was what I was there for.

577
00:59:17,727 --> 00:59:21,800
Round after round, I kept
getting Frankie to patch me up.

578
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:24,879
He's talking about throwing in
the towel,

579
00:59:25,007 --> 00:59:27,999
but he ain't my manager,
he can't throw in nothing.

580
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:32,325
Round after round,
he's arguing with me.

581
00:59:34,007 --> 00:59:38,444
I'm laughing because
it's getting more to him than to me.

582
00:59:38,607 --> 00:59:43,362
I go 15 rounds lose by decision.

583
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:47,878
Next morning I lose the eye.

584
00:59:49,407 --> 00:59:52,717
In 23 years
he's never said a thing about it.

585
00:59:52,887 --> 00:59:57,517
Doesn't have to. I can see it in
his face every time he looks at me.

586
00:59:57,687 --> 01:00:02,715
Somehow Frankie thinks
he should've stopped that fight,

587
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:06,964
should've saved my eye.

588
01:00:08,407 --> 01:00:12,685
Spends his life wishing he could
take back that 109th fight.

589
01:00:12,847 --> 01:00:16,522
I wanted to go to 110.

590
01:00:16,687 --> 01:00:21,158
Thing is,
if you want to get to the title

591
01:00:22,007 --> 01:00:24,999
maybe he's not the one
to take you there.

592
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:32,925
You tell Mr. Mack
we'd be here tonight?

593
01:00:34,727 --> 01:00:38,925
- Eat your cupcake.
- No, I got it.

594
01:00:45,007 --> 01:00:48,636
It's the rule.
Always protect yourself.

595
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,918
People never take theirown advice.

596
01:00:52,047 --> 01:00:56,802
If she was going to leave Frankie,
better she did it to him then.

597
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:04,677
Mr. Mickey Mack?
I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

598
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:10,922
I hear you're a real good manager.
Doing good things for Big Willie.

599
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:15,005
But I thought you should know
I ain't never leaving Mr. Dunn,

600
01:01:15,167 --> 01:01:18,762
so you don't need to make
any more excuses to bump into me.

601
01:01:19,247 --> 01:01:22,239
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

602
01:01:26,647 --> 01:01:29,878
Maggie always did like
taking them out in the first round.

603
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:05,404
The letters always came back
marked the same way,

604
01:02:05,527 --> 01:02:08,519
"Return to Sender".

605
01:02:36,607 --> 01:02:39,360
I will make you some coffee.

606
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,238
- What are you doing with your money?
- Saving it.

607
01:02:47,207 --> 01:02:50,404
You save enough of it, you ought
to get yourself a little house.

608
01:02:50,527 --> 01:02:54,315
- Cash, no mortgage.
- It'll take me a while.

609
01:02:57,007 --> 01:03:02,559
It might be a stretch, but you got
to get yourself a place of your own.

610
01:03:02,727 --> 01:03:06,356
Go around wasting iton things that
don't matter and what do you got?

611
01:03:06,527 --> 01:03:11,282
You understand? Pretty soon, you
wait long enough, you got nothing.

612
01:03:11,407 --> 01:03:14,365
Okay, soon as I get the money.

613
01:03:14,487 --> 01:03:18,196
I made a lot of mistakes, I'm trying
to keep you from doing the same.

614
01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:23,202
- I know, boss.
- I'm not going to live forever.

615
01:03:23,327 --> 01:03:26,558
- What is it?
- A tape on that girl in England.

616
01:03:26,727 --> 01:03:29,719
If you're going to go for the title,
we got some moves to...

617
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:32,884
Get the hell down!
You know how old I am?

618
01:03:35,807 --> 01:03:39,277
You're welcome, darling.
Now let me put this in the machine.

619
01:03:39,407 --> 01:03:42,046
What machine?

620
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:45,159
- Don't have a TV, huh?
- No.

621
01:03:56,167 --> 01:03:59,159
- Ten minutes, luv.
- Thank you.

622
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:03,246
- Man says he loves me.
- I bet he's not the first to say it.

623
01:04:03,407 --> 01:04:05,967
First since my daddy.

624
01:04:06,087 --> 01:04:10,160
- I win, you think he'll propose?
- You win, I'll propose.

625
01:04:14,447 --> 01:04:16,836
I've got you a gift here.

626
01:04:20,287 --> 01:04:24,485
- They gave you somebody else's.
- No. This is it.

627
01:04:24,647 --> 01:04:29,960
- What does it mean?
- It's something in Gaelic.

628
01:04:34,607 --> 01:04:37,075
Real silk thread.

629
01:04:38,927 --> 01:04:41,999
From the United States of America

630
01:04:42,127 --> 01:04:46,678
the challenger Maggie Fitzgerald!

631
01:04:49,767 --> 01:04:52,964
"Mo Cuishle".
Did you see what was on her robe?

632
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:59,919
She wasn't the main attraction.

633
01:05:00,087 --> 01:05:03,079
She was on the undercard
of a middleweight title fight.

634
01:05:03,527 --> 01:05:06,200
But ask someone who was there,

635
01:05:06,327 --> 01:05:09,842
they couldn't tell you
who else fought that night.

636
01:05:58,927 --> 01:06:00,918
She's tough.

637
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:05,956
I can't get close enough to hit her.

638
01:06:06,127 --> 01:06:09,039
- You know why that is?
- Why?

639
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:12,398
She's a better fighter than you are.
She's younger, stronger

640
01:06:12,527 --> 01:06:16,520
and more experienced.
What are you going to do about it?

641
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,874
I could ask someone.

642
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:18,828
Good.
You find out, you let me know.

643
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,592
Whatever it meant, the name stuck.

644
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,076
Maggie fought in Edinburgh
and Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.

645
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,875
It was always "Mo cuishle".

646
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,959
Seems there're lrish people
everywhere, or people who want to be.

647
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,472
By the time
they came back to the States,

648
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,632
Maggie was in a whole new league.

649
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,436
After that they got another offer
to fight for the title.

650
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,192
What's the split?

651
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,634
- 60-40.
- Good.

652
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:31,355
We'll take 60 and you take 40,
being as that Maggie's the draw.

653
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,229
- That little girl?
- You think I'm wrong, really?

654
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,909
You think people are saying
they want to see some scrabby Kraut

655
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,077
beat up on Miss What's-her-name?
You find someone who says that

656
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,192
and we'll take the40.

657
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:58,311
They're at 60-40
but they'll come up to 50-50.

658
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,593
How's that girl doing?

659
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,792
She's got a concussion
and a broken eardrum.

660
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,151
- She be all right?
- And if she isn't?

661
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,919
Maybe I should send her something.

662
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,032
You could send her your check,
I'm sure she'd take it.

663
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,836
That little house we talked about?
I bought it.

664
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,471
- Well, smart girl.
- For my mama.

665
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:34,270
It's a mile from where she lives.
No mortgage, just like you said.

666
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:40,314
- You're a good daughter.
- She doesn't know about it yet.

667
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:44,718
I was hoping maybe we could stay
an extra day, drive over there?

668
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:50,836
- I know she wants to meet you.
- Yeah. We could do that.

669
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,831
Oh, my God! Mama, come on out here.

670
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,157
Mary M's here.

671
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,915
- This is the Johnson's old house.
- Not anymore.

672
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:40,799
It's all yours, mama.
For you and Mardell and the kids!

673
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:44,754
- You bought this for me?
- All yours, free and clear!

674
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,998
- Darling...
- There's no fridge, no stove.

675
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,112
They'll be here before you move in.

676
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,674
- How much money did this cost you?
- You never mind that.

677
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,519
- You shouldn't a done this.
- You need a decent place.

678
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,712
You shouldn't a done it!
You should've asked me first!

679
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,317
Government's gonna find out about it,
they'll stop my welfare.

680
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,876
- They ain't.
- You're fine, you're working,

681
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,629
but I can't live without my welfare!
- I send you money.

682
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,156
What about my medicine?
Medicaid going to cut me off.

683
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:19,716
- How I'm gonna get my medicine?
- I'll send you more money.

684
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,589
Hope you don't expect J.D. to move
in here with us. He's getting out.

685
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,752
Why didn'tyou
just give me the money?

686
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,838
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

687
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,670
Didn't have to, mama. But it's yours.

688
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,872
You want the money? Sell it.

689
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:56,075
You didn't mean nothing hurtful,
but you don't think things through.

690
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,272
- That's true, Mama.
- I'll try and keep the house.

691
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,551
 I just worry about
all those expenses.

692
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,712
I'll send you some more money.

693
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,796
That man hitting you?

694
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,919
It's from the fight.
I'm a fighter, Mama.

695
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:25,039
Find a man, Mary M.
Live proper.

696
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,118
People hear about what you're doing
and they laugh.

697
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:31,516
Hurts me to tell you,
but they laugh atyou.

698
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,272
You ever own a dog?

699
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:59,190
Nope. Closest I ever came
was a middleweight from Barstow!

700
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,430
My daddy had a German Shepherd, Axel.

701
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,518
Axel's hindquarters were so bad

702
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,950
he had to drag himself
room to room by his front legs.

703
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,913
Me and Mardell'd bust up laughing

704
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,555
scoot across the kitchen floor.

705
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:22,076
Daddy was so sick by then,
he couldn't hardly stand himself.

706
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:27,433
But one morning he got up
and carried Axel to his rig

707
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:31,030
and the two of them went off
into the woods, singing and howling.

708
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,832
Wasn't till he got home
that night, alone,

709
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,997
that I saw the shovel
in the back of the truck.

710
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,916
Sure miss watching
the two of them together.

711
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,952
I got nobody but you, Frankie.

712
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,873
Well, you've got me.

713
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,277
At least, that is until
we find you a good manager.

714
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,991
Can we stop just up here?

715
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,833
This place has
the best lemon pie around.

716
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,872
None of that canned filling crap!

717
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,478
Now I can die and go to Heaven!

718
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:51,033
I used to come here with Daddy.

719
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:55,152
I wonder if a place like this
is for sale.

720
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,238
I got a little bit of savings.

721
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:15,071
- What the hell's Danger looking at?
- Another bottle of water.

722
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,112
Want to come to Vegas with us?

723
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:21,391
Watch you suffer
over the nickel slots.

724
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:25,308
- My hart can't take it.
- She's got a title shot.

725
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:29,069
The Blue Bear. Million dollars,
split right down the center.

726
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,396
I could use a good second. Can't
find one, I thought I'd ask you.

727
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,114
Why would I want to do that?

728
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:40,949
Because you're a half-blind old fool
who never got there himself.

729
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:44,675
you might like to feel what's like
to be in a ring on a title match.

730
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,912
Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.

731
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:51,555
No, you pick up somebody
there in Vegas.

732
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,951
- Somebody with young hands!
- You're not going to cry, are you?

733
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:59,949
- I've already got one girl.
- I leave this place for one day,

734
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,998
got any idea what it would look
like when I come back?

735
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,317
- Kind of like it looks right now.
- Go to hell!

736
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,993
Tell Maggie don't come back
without a belt!

737
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,594
Will do!

738
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:22,439
I got a question,
but I feel real stupid asking it.

739
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,358
No such thing
as a stupid question there, Danger.

740
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,756
How'd you get all the ice in here
through this little tiny hole?

741
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:35,555
I been thinking on it,
can't figure it out.

742
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:39,958
- Why don't I show you, Danger?
- You could show me?

743
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:45,633
Also, I was kind of thinking
I might be ready for a fight.

744
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:53,312
- I got the tickets. You ready?
- We're flying?

745
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:57,917
- Would you rather drive?
- You're asking me?

746
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,677
Would you rather fly
or would you rather drive?

747
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,958
- I finally get to decide something?
- That's what I'm saying.

748
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:09,476
Fly there, drive back.

749
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:13,315
That's the stupidest thing I've ever
heard. How are we going to do that?

750
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,278
You said it was up to me.

751
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:29,471
- Give them hell there, Danger.
- The toilet's overflowing.

752
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,631
Flippy, come here for a minute.

753
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,311
Dumb-ass!

754
01:18:55,720 --> 01:19:00,555
Could be sitting up at The Mirage,
drinking mai tais,

755
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,240
looking at naked women!

756
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:38,355
Come on now, Flip.
Whatare you doing? Let him go.

757
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,115
I've gotcha now.

758
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,636
- We don't need no corner trainer.
- How'd I do, Mr. Scrap?

759
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,839
You did good, Danger.
You my man, you rock!

760
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,151
Come on, Flip. You ain't done.
You ain't even fight good yet.

761
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,477
Anybody can lose one fight, son.

762
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,478
You'll come back from this,
you'II be champion of the world.

763
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,552
No, I won't, Mr. Scrap.

764
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,798
- I should've known.
- We don't need this honky!

765
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:14,799
- Let me help you.
- Untie the Velcro for me.

766
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,276
Don't take the gloves off, man.
You ain't even used them, Danger.

767
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:28,113
- Mind if I borrow these?
- I thought your name was "Danger"!

768
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:34,310
I see. Now I get to fight
a retard and a old man.

769
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:38,029
Call ESPN, 'cause
you can't write this shit!

770
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,589
110.

771
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,873
Get a job, punk!

772
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:42,711
Win this one
and l'll tell you what it means.

773
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,276
I got you some pipers.

774
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:09,111
Jab her right it the tits,
until they turn blue and fall off.

775
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:29,837
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the
feature presentation of the evening.

776
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:34,670
In this corner,
the challenger, Maggie Fitzgerald,

777
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:38,833
in the red corner.
In the blue corner,

778
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,794
the WBA Welterweight
champion ofthe world,

779
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,718
Billie "The Blue Bear".

780
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:08,950
Fitzgerald is pushing the Blue Bear
around the ring, coming on strong.

781
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:14,632
Challenger darts in, lands a
combination to the head and the body.

782
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,836
A right hook stunts the champ.

783
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:21,272
Break it up!

784
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,358
Do that one more time, it'll cost you
a point, do you hear me?

785
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,674
Fight.

786
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:01,315
I'm going to take away one point.
One point deduction off the blue corner.

787
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:07,273
Ref, open your eyes!

788
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:26,915
The first round is in the books
on this championship match.

789
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,594
- Looking good.
- Pull that crap one more time,

790
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:42,314
you're disqualified.

791
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,352
- It's going to be all right.
- Got no doubt, boss.

792
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:59,157
Watch yourself,
stay away from this dame.

793
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:13,791
Go to the neutral corner!

794
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:17,869
Stay there, bitch!

795
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,475
Fitzgerald continues to pummel the
Blue Bear, the East German Champion.

796
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,991
Eyes are blurring.

797
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,588
- How many eyes do you need?
- One's enough.

798
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,992
What do I do about the Bear?

799
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:25,078
Do you know that step into
the outside and hook into the liver?

800
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,629
I been doing that.
She's made of steel.

801
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:31,070
Don't go to the liver this time,
hit her right up under her skinny ass.

802
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:34,909
Right in the sciatic nerve. Keep
digging it in there, digging it in.

803
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:38,112
- Keep sticking her.
- What about the Ref?

804
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,795
Keep yourself between the Ref and
the Bear and everything will be fine.

805
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:47,509
This is you.
You keep it going. You keep it up.

806
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,633
Get the doctor!

807
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:10,472
Come on. Breathe.

808
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:14,832
That's it. Breathe. Good.

809
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:20,637
Concentrate on me. Breathe. Good.

810
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:14,318
How you feeling, darling?

811
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,111
Growing a beard, boss?

812
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:27,670
Yeah, I thought it might help me
with the ladies.

813
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,678
Can't say it does.

814
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:03,317
- Does it hurt much?
- Don't hurt at all.

815
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:14,428
Where's Frankie?

816
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:19,951
He's out there
talking to the doctors.

817
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:23,834
Probably telling them
how to do their job.

818
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:29,871
They're telling him
I'm a C1 and C2 complete.

819
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:37,356
My spinal cord's so broke
they'll never be able to fix it.

820
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:44,433
Going to be frozen like this
the rest of my life.

821
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:53,318
I asked them to tell him. I don't
know how he's going to take it.

822
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,833
Did you see the fight?

823
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:09,589
Course I did.
You had her cold, Maggie.

824
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:14,070
I shouldn't a dropped my hands.

825
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,992
I shouldn't a turned.

826
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:31,675
Always protect myself,
how many times he tell me that?

827
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:37,239
Does like to repeat himself.

828
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:44,595
Will you tell him I'm real sorry?

829
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:52,191
No. I won't do no such thing, Maggie.

830
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,958
Damnedest thing.

831
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,877
So, what's the plan?

832
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,037
I know you got one, so you might
as well tell me what it is.

833
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:27,518
It's your fault
she's lying in there like that.

834
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:31,599
You kept after me until I trained
her. I know I shouldn't have done it.

835
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:35,759
Her being a girl and all.
Everything kept telling me not to.

836
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:38,235
Everything but you.

837
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:52,117
I'm going to get you out of here.
These doctors don't know squat.

838
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:54,879
Otherwise why would they
be living out here in the desert?

839
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,918
As soon as you're able to be moved

840
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:01,516
we'll find someplace where
they've actually studied medicine.

841
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:08,792
You just rest there. I'm on it.

842
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,992
Frankie must've called
every hospital in America

843
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,793
looking for somebody who'd tell him
they could fix her.

844
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:26,912
He came close twice
till they checked her over,

845
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:30,032
said there was nothing to be done.

846
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:33,118
Took two months till
she was stable enough to move.

847
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:43,951
- They got nurses for that.
- They're amateurs.

848
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:59,515
She developed skin ulcers because
she couldn't change positions.

849
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:25,069
They made the six-hour trip
by ambulance.

850
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,674
Fly there, drive back.

851
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:47,713
The rehab center Frankie found
was a nice place.

852
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:52,436
They took care of Maggie. She would
not have complained if they hadn't.

853
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:57,549
Took several hours every day
to get her ready for the wheelchair.

854
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:11,352
Since she couldn't breathe on her
own, her respirators were always on.

855
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:16,872
Oxygen was pumped into her
24 hours a day.

856
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:45,195
Maggie's mama called to say
they were all coming for a visit.

857
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:48,790
She waited by the window every day
for the next two weeks.

858
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:52,918
Frankie finally tracked them down

859
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:56,999
learned they'd checked
into their hotel six days earlier.

860
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:00,795
Kept leaving messages
which were never returned.

861
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:07,191
You don't have
to hang around all day.

862
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,997
I like it here. I don't mind.

863
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:17,954
If you weren't here, I'd come here
anyway to read my books.

864
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:24,550
Mama will be here soon,
share some of the burden.

865
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:27,319
It's no burden.

866
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:31,194
Here, read this.

867
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:44,035
That's enough. That's terrible!

868
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:49,031
l'll tell you in English
what you were saying.

869
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:57,111
Itsays: "I will arise
and go now and go to Innisfree.

870
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:01,279
And a small cabin build there,
of clay and wattles made.

871
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:04,551
And I shall have some peace there,

872
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:07,592
for peace comes dropping slow.

873
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:10,029
Dropping from the veils of the
morning,

874
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:15,678
to where the crickets sings."
Not bad, huh?

875
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,878
- You going to build a cabin, boss?
- Me?

876
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:29,512
You know, when you quit all this.

877
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:35,432
You mean boxing? No, l'll never quit.

878
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,953
Like the stink too much, I guess.

879
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:49,759
I could see you there, real easy,
with your books and lemon pie.

880
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:54,632
How about you?
Would you like to go live in a cabin?

881
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:59,350
I could learn how to bake.

882
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:05,352
Well, then, maybe I'll start looking.

883
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,918
I'm Frankie Dunn.
I met you back out in Missouri.

884
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:44,033
- Where's my little girl?
- You ought to go back and change.

885
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:47,072
She doesn't know you've been here
a week visiting Woody and Mickey.

886
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:50,158
We got business with my sister.
Why don't you just tell us where she is?

887
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:54,472
You must be J.D. the business guy.
There's some rides you missed.

888
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:59,156
- I'll tell her you couldn't make it.
- I drove here to visit my child.

889
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:03,558
You're suggesting I'm not a good
mother? Mary can't go nowhere

890
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:06,513
if we could have taken her
to Disneyland we would have.

891
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:11,196
- Margaret Fitzgerald?
- Right down here. 301.

892
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:23,952
I saw myself breathing!
My body was going up and down.

893
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,913
I thought,
"Why didn't somebody tell me?"

894
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:32,276
Your hear needs washing.
It's kind of greasy.

895
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:51,075
- It's just some kind of legal thing.
- What is it?

896
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:55,870
- How we all doing here?
- We ain't got a lot oftime.

897
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,676
Mr. Johnson is charging us a lot of
money to make sure this is legal.

898
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:04,759
Leave that
and l'll read it to her later.

899
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,754
You part of our family?
Stay the hell out ofthis.

900
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:13,478
- Read it to me, Mama.
- It's just something legal...

901
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:17,838
...to protect your money.
- You don't have to worry.

902
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,913
The Boxing Commission's paying
for all this, everything.

903
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:27,200
What if they don't? Mr. Johnson
says they can take my house.

904
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:30,557
Assign your assets to your mother
and no one will touch them.

905
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:33,956
No doctors, no funeral expenses.
Nothing.

906
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,072
Why don't you leave it
and l'll read it to her later on...

907
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:39,839
This isn't your business.

908
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,595
All right. I'll be out in the hall.

909
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:52,358
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

910
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:56,359
You sign that paper,
it'll take care of your family,

911
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:59,916
the way your daddy
would have wanted you to.

912
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:06,077
How do you make your mark?

913
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:12,196
- Can you hold a pen?
- She gotta do it with her teeth.

914
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:17,030
- You gotta put it in her mouth.
- Here you go, honey.

915
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,869
- Did you see the fight, Mama?
- You know how I feel about that.

916
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:27,873
I did pretty good.

917
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:33,990
You lost, Mary M. Ain't yourfault,
the way I heard it, but you lost.

918
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:38,872
Don't want to lose
the rest of what you got left.

919
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:53,069
- What happened to you?
- What's that supposed to mean?

920
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:58,155
You take Mardell and J.D.
and get home.

921
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:03,275
Before I tell that lawyer that you
were so worried about your welfare

922
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:06,392
you never signed those house papers
like you were supposed to.

923
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:11,873
So any time I feel like it
I can sell that house

924
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,992
from your fat,
lazy, hillbilly asses!

925
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,791
And if you ever come back,
that's exactly what I'll do.

926
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:03,394
Maybe someone ought to count to ten!

927
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:18,433
Don't smell real pretty,
does it, Doc?

928
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,798
We might have to lose it, Maggie.

929
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:39,672
They took my leg, boss.

930
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,071
It's gonna be all right. You hear?

931
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:50,192
I always hear your voice, boss.

932
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,634
You need anything?

933
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:28,951
I need to know
what "Mo Cuishle" means.

934
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:33,869
You didn't win,
I don't have to tell you.

935
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:42,119
You're the meanest man I ever met,
no wonder no one loves you!

936
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:48,478
You remind me of my daddy.

937
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:56,153
Well, he must have been
a very intelligent, handsome man!

938
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:03,597
You ain't gonna make me
talk no more Yeats, are you?

939
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:10,194
I was looking at this catalog
from City College.

940
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:15,156
I thought I'd get you a wheelchair,

941
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:19,034
maybe the kind that operates
by blowing through a straw.

942
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:23,076
I thought maybe you'd like
to go back to school.

943
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:30,032
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

944
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,994
Anything you want.

945
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:41,515
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

946
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:56,118
Don't even think about that.

947
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:02,272
I can't be like this, Frankie.

948
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:08,469
Not after what I've done,
I have seen the world.

949
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:13,952
People chanted my name.

950
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:21,273
Not my name,
some damn name you gave me,

951
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:26,593
but they were chanting for me.

952
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:32,878
I was in magazines.

953
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,992
You think I ever dreamed
that'd happen?

954
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:45,750
I was born at two pounds,
one-and-a-half ounces.

955
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:52,272
Daddy used to tell me
I fought to get into this world

956
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,072
and I'd fight my way out.

957
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:06,312
That's all I want to do, Frankie.

958
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:10,352
I just don't want to fight you
to do it.

959
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,515
I got what I needed.

960
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:20,680
I got itall.

961
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:27,032
Don't let them
keep taking itaway from me.

962
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:36,675
Don't let me lie here till I can't
hear those people chanting no more.

963
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:43,635
I can't.

964
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:51,432
Please, don't ask me.

965
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:55,193
I'm asking.

966
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:53,032
In the middle of the night,
Maggie had found her own solution.

967
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:56,872
She had bit her tongue.

968
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:12,113
Look at me.

969
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:29,159
Nearly bled to death
before they stitched her up.

970
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:32,875
She came around and ripped them out
before Frankie even got there.

971
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:37,152
They stitched her up again,

972
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:40,272
padded the tongue
so she couldn't bite.

973
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:59,472
You can't do it, you know that.

974
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:05,432
I do, Father.
You don't know how thick she is,

975
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:08,552
how hard it was to train her.

976
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:11,996
Other fighters would do
exactly what you say to them

977
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:15,635
and she'd ask,
"why this" and "why that"

978
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:18,320
and do it her own way, anyway.

979
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:22,234
How she fought for the title...
Wasn't by anything...

980
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:25,158
it wasn't by listening to me.

981
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:38,637
But now she wants to die
and I just want to keep her with me.

982
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:45,438
And I swear to God, Father,

983
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:49,473
it's committing a sin by doing it.

984
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:52,751
By keeping her alive,
I'm killing her.

985
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:56,919
Do you know what I mean?
How do I get around that?

986
01:52:57,080 --> 01:53:02,950
You don't. You step aside, Frankie.
You leave it with God.

987
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:07,159
She's not asking for God's help.
She's asking for mine.

988
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:10,670
I've seen you at mass
almost every day for 23 years.

989
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:14,839
A man who comes to church this much
can't forgive himself for something.

990
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:20,120
Whatever sins you're carrying,
they're nothing compared to this.

991
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:23,875
Forget about God or Heaven and Hell.

992
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,595
If you do this thing, you'll be lost

993
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:32,599
somewhere so deep,

994
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:37,156
you'll never find yourself again.

995
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:45,916
I think I did it already.

996
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:09,437
We're keeping her sedated
so she won't try that again.

997
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,992
I went to see Maggie this morning.

998
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:20,478
- You must have been somewhere else.
- Yeah.

999
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:26,872
You got a fight I don't know about?

1000
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:36,716
lt wasn't your fault.
I was wrong to say that.

1001
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:39,713
You're damn right.

1002
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:43,833
I found you a fighter and you made
her the best fighter she could be.

1003
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:48,872
And I killed her.

1004
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:51,270
Don't say that.

1005
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:54,392
Maggie walked through that door
with nothing but guts,

1006
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:57,432
no chance in the world
of being what she needed to be.

1007
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:00,552
A year and a half later, she fights
for the championship of the world.

1008
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:05,356
You did that.
People die every day, Frankie,

1009
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:10,156
mopping floors, washing dishes.
You know what their last thought is?

1010
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:15,559
I never got my shot.
Because of you, Maggie got her shot.

1011
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:20,389
If she dies today, you know
what her last thought will be?

1012
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:23,393
"I think I did all right."

1013
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:33,392
I know I could rest with that.

1014
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:29,274
I'll get a cup of coffee.

1015
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,311
All right.

1016
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:04,678
I'm gonna disconnect
your air machine

1017
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:07,912
then you're gonna go to sleep.

1018
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,393
Then I'll give you a shot
and you'll stay asleep.

1019
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:24,234
Mo Cuishle

1020
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:29,151
means "my darling, my blood".

1021
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:37,039
He gave her a single shot.

1022
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:41,073
It was enough adrenaline
to do the job a few times over.

1023
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:44,431
He didn't want her
going through this again.

1024
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:37,036
Then he walked out.
I don't think he had anything left.

1025
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:57,757
I went back to the gym.

1026
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:01,595
Waited, figuring
he'd turn up sooner or later.

1027
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:23,391
And that's when a ghost
came through the door.

1028
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:29,429
I got to thinking what you said,
Mist' Scrap.

1029
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:31,670
What was that, Danger?

1030
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:35,712
Anybody can lose one fight.

1031
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:41,920
That's the truth. Put your gloves on.
You missed a lot of training.

1032
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:46,357
Will do, Mist' Scrap. Sure thing.

1033
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:07,152
Frankie never came back at all.

1034
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:24,716
Frankie didn't leave a note
and nobody knew where he went.

1035
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:28,238
I'd hoped he'd gone to find you

1036
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:31,352
and ask you one more time
to forgive him.

1037
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:34,472
But maybe he didn't have
anything left in his heart.

1038
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:38,037
I just hope he found someplace
where he could find a little peace.

1039
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:41,636
A place set
in the cedars and oak trees.

1040
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:44,638
Somewhere between
nowhere and good-bye.

1041
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:48,112
But that's probably wishful thinking.

1042
02:02:49,080 --> 02:02:51,469
No matter where he is

1043
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:54,956
I thought you should know what
kind of man your father really was.

1044
