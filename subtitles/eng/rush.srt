<i>Listen.</i>

3
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,767
<i>Can you hear it?</i>

4
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,166
<i>The music.</i>

5
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:32,110
<i>I can hear it everywhere.</i>

6
00:00:34,684 --> 00:00:36,447
<i>In the wind...</i>

7
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:39,885
<i>... in the air...</i>

8
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:43,822
<i>... in the light.</i>

9
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:51,659
<i>It's all around us.</i>

10
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:05,174
<i>All you have to do is open yourself up.</i>

11
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:17,717
<i>All you have to do...</i>

12
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:20,626
<i>... is listen.</i>

13
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,248
Hello, Porky. Where's your little friend?

14
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:17,614
- I don't know, Mr. Mannix.
- Go find him or your big butt's mine.

15
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:20,483
<i>Where I've grown up</i>...

16
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:21,681
Evan!

17
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,284
Evan!

18
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:28,123
- <i>they tried to stop me</i>
<i>from hearing the music.</i>

19
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:34,327
<i>But when I'm alone...</i>

20
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,005
<i>... it builds up from inside me.</i>

21
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:43,675
<i>And I think if I could learn</i>
<i>how to play it...</i>

22
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,916
<i>... they might hear me.</i>

23
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,518
<i>They would know I was theirs...</i>

24
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:57,789
<i>... and find me.</i>

25
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,820
Knock, knock.

26
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:04,091
- Knock, knock.
- Knock, knock.

27
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,393
- Knock, knock.
- Wake up.

28
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:07,433
Who's there? Who's there?

29
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:11,634
Freak. Freak.

30
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:16,373
- Said, knock, knock, freak.
- Who's there?

31
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:19,379
Your long-lost mommy and daddy.

32
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,578
Can you hear them?

33
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:25,247
Yes.

34
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,557
No, you can't.

35
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:33,693
I can.

36
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:41,197
You don't have no family.

37
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,066
You can't hear anything.

38
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,007
Say it.

39
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:49,807
- Say it.
- Say it. Say it.

40
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,879
- Say it.
- Say it.

41
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:53,174
- Say it.
- Say it.

42
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,078
Say it.

43
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,586
Yes...

44
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,345
...I can.

45
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:03,585
He doesn't hear anything.

46
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:05,558
Yeah.

47
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,158
What is he?

48
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,224
He's a freak.

49
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:17,532
- Sweet dreams, freaks.
- Sleep tight.

50
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:20,198
- Good night.
- Don't let the bed bugs bite.

51
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:28,079
<i>Sometimes the world</i>
<i>tries to knock it out of you.</i>

52
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,179
<i>But I believe in music...</i>

53
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,554
<i>... the way that some people</i>
<i>believe in fairy tales.</i>

54
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:55,367
<i>I like to imagine that what I hear</i>
<i>came from my mother and father.</i>

55
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:15,824
<i>Maybe the notes I hear...</i>

56
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:20,766
<i>... are the same ones they heard</i>
<i>the night they met.</i>

57
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:25,500
<i>Maybe that's how they found each other.</i>

58
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:30,869
<i>Maybe that's how they'll find me.</i>

59
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:34,272
Louis. Louie, where are you?

60
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,112
- Lyla? She's here. What are you doing?
- Dad.

61
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:40,744
They're waiting for us.
Hey, sit up straight, please.

62
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,483
Where are you, baby bro?

63
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:46,924
We didn't follow you from San Francisco
to play for free, man. Yeah?

64
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,429
We need this one, baby bro. All right?
I need this one.

65
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,431
Don't forget to smile and look relaxed.

66
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:56,532
All right, not that relaxed.
Come on, come on.

67
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:02,773
<i>I believe that, once upon a time...</i>

68
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:05,142
<i>... long ago...</i>

69
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,850
<i>... they heard the music and followed it.</i>

70
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:05,953
- Not bad, Connelly. Not bad.
- Thanks very much, man.

71
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,356
Where's the main man?

72
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,325
Goddamn it, Louis. Just wait, man.

73
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:15,662
Louis? Louis, wait up, man.

74
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:22,002
Girls, we are going to a party tonight.

75
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:25,511
It's a full moon,
you know what that means, right?

76
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,151
Lyla.

77
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:25,073
It's a great sound, isn't it?

78
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,601
What are you doing?

79
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:30,405
Listening.

80
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:34,446
What are you doing?

81
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:41,582
- I just came up here to...
- Get away?

82
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:48,391
Have a seat.

83
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,931
Come on, be brave.

84
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:54,069
Front row, center.

85
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:21,087
Can you hear that?

86
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:23,662
What is that?

87
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,829
It's a wish.

88
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,937
Now, what does that sound like?

89
00:11:57,933 --> 00:11:59,924
When I was a young fellow...

90
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,068
...I used to talk to the moon.

91
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:06,000
Are you making that up?

92
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:10,168
God, I haven't done that in a long time.

93
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,010
Does it ever talk back?

94
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:19,645
Well, it used to.

95
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:24,815
Now I just find myself on a roof
talking to myself...

96
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,485
...like a loon.

97
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:33,792
Just out here on me own.

98
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:38,069
Well, I'm here.

99
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:42,635
Yes, you are.

100
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:53,011
I'm Louis.

101
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,186
Lyla.

102
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,021
So, what's your story, Lyla?

103
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,764
I don't know. I'm just...

104
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:09,866
I'm just me.

105
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,612
What are you looking at?

106
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:21,439
You.

107
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:20,265
Next.

108
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,277
What did he want? What did you say?

109
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,141
You know, same old junk. New guy.

110
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,574
My name is Mr. Jeffries.

111
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:33,779
I'm with Child Services
for the state of New York.

112
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:36,748
Okay, Evan.

113
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:41,363
Born December 17th, 1995.

114
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,863
Legal adoption to New York Childrers.

115
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:50,665
How long have you been here, Evan?

116
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:52,871
Eleven years and sixteen days.

117
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,668
I've been counting.

118
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,547
That's a long time.

119
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,084
- How do you do that?
- Do what?

120
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:10,391
Well, it's just imitating the wind chimes.

121
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,672
You don't wanna be placed
with a real family?

122
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:30,107
- I have a family.
- Yes, you do.

123
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,612
I mean, you have parents and all,
but they don't live with you.

124
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:34,942
Not now.

125
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:39,184
But still,
you don't have contact with them.

126
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,813
- Yes, I do.
- You do?

127
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,090
What, do they call you?

128
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:51,794
Come and visit you?

129
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:53,529
- Send...?
- I...

130
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:58,566
I don't wanna be sent away.

131
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,477
I understand.

132
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:08,043
You see, there's a lot of children...

133
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,913
...who are scared
that if they leave their first home...

134
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:13,418
...their parents would never
be able to find them.

135
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:16,081
Right?

136
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:18,421
But see, my job is to make sure...

137
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:22,030
...that nothing like that
will ever happen to you.

138
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:25,325
So there's nothing to be scared of.

139
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:28,630
Thank you.

140
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:37,571
I'm gonna do something I never do.

141
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:40,976
This is my number.

142
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,348
If you ever need to talk to me,
about anything...

143
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:48,445
...you call.

144
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:51,115
Think about what I said too.

145
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:55,754
There's a whole world out there
with millions of wind chimes.

146
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:57,696
I know.

147
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:06,638
You can go now.

148
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:20,115
<i>Mannix says we're never</i>
<i>gonna see our real parents again.</i>

149
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,416
Mannix is a big liar.

150
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:26,388
Yeah, I know. But what if he's right?

151
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:29,759
I mean, what if they don't ever come?

152
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:32,867
Hardly remember what my mom
looks like, you know?

153
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:39,501
Well, if they don't find us,
we'll just have to go find them.

154
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:20,339
- Oh, my God.
- Morning.

155
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,881
- How's it going?
- Oh, my God.

156
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,347
Get away.

157
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:26,144
I have to go.

158
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:28,414
- Let me walk you home.
- No.

159
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,558
My dad's waiting at the Sherry. I...

160
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:33,655
I've never done this before.
I'm in so much trouble.

161
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:35,592
Hey, hey.

162
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:39,632
Meet me here at 10:00 by the arch.

163
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:42,236
- Say yes.
- Put him out of his misery. Say yes.

164
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:43,894
- Say yes.
- Say it.

165
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:45,733
Say yes.

166
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:50,868
After you.

167
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:53,280
I'll take that as a yes.

168
00:18:57,786 --> 00:19:01,779
You are gonna be in so much trouble.
You should have left your dad a note.

169
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:04,653
Yeah, ransom note.
You know what? I don't even care.

170
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:08,092
I just had the most incredible night
of my life.

171
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:09,560
Taxi!

172
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:19,332
Louis. She ain't coming.

173
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:22,671
Oh, man. One girl?

174
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:25,439
Come on, we're gonna miss the flight.

175
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,243
- Taxi!
- Louis. Where you going, Louis?

176
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:35,616
Excuse me.

177
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:38,887
Louie.

178
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,426
You are not going anywhere.

179
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:44,593
- Lyla!
- Dad, I'm not going with you.

180
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,496
- Lyla, you listen to me.
- No.

181
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:50,365
- Don't you dare walk away.
- I'm not going with you.

182
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,706
Lyla!

183
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:08,018
Get in the car right now.

184
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:13,459
Lyla! Lyla!

185
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,269
Louis.

186
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,313
Do you remember what Da used to say
about princesses?

187
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,544
They're always looking for their prince.
And you ain't no prince, brother.

188
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:40,914
How would you know?

189
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:43,824
What am I gonna do now?

190
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:00,268
<i>I know they're out there somewhere.</i>

191
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:17,056
<i>I don't know where it comes from...</i>

192
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:22,526
<i>... but it's what I hold on to.</i>

193
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:29,062
<i>And I can't let go.</i>

194
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,941
<i>Somewhere inside me...</i>

195
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,074
<i>... I know that they always wanted me.</i>

196
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,850
<i>Maybe they just got lost.</i>

197
00:22:50,318 --> 00:22:52,843
<i>What's the point in singing, Marshall?</i>

198
00:22:53,722 --> 00:22:55,349
<i>She's not gonna hear me.</i>

199
00:22:56,191 --> 00:22:59,160
<i>I'm leaving the band.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, Marshall.</i>

200
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:01,295
<i>Don't quit on us, Louis.</i>

201
00:23:07,235 --> 00:23:09,897
Everything you've given up,
everything I've given up...

202
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:14,335
I can't do it. I'm sorry, Frank.
I can't do it, man.

203
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:16,204
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
- No!

204
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:18,539
- You know what I mean? I don't know...
- Dad!

205
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:20,203
...how to approach this problem.

206
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:22,373
I mean, where are you
gonna put the baby?

207
00:23:22,551 --> 00:23:25,577
And what about this boy?
He's not here now. He's not here now.

208
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:27,153
- I'm leaving.
- You can't leave.

209
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,382
- Where you going, then?
- Just let me go. Will you just let me go?

210
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:40,026
- Louis.
- Lyla.

211
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:44,670
Hey, Louis.

212
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,508
Lyla.

213
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:12,627
We have fetal distress.

214
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:16,594
Baby's heart rate is falling.

215
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:20,668
It's falling.

216
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:51,034
I'm sorry.

217
00:24:55,777 --> 00:24:57,642
He's gone.

218
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:03,607
Picked him up on the thruway
outside of Montrose.

219
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:06,838
Just wandering down the road.
Said he's following the music.

220
00:26:07,015 --> 00:26:09,677
The moon told him to.
Yeah. Kid's a space cadet.

221
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,058
Look, I got a busy day ahead of me.

222
00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:21,492
All right, big guy, out you go.

223
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,756
This Jeffries guy wasn't in his office yet...

224
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:26,526
...so I left him a message
to pick you up right here.

225
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:28,362
- Okay.
- Here. Hold on.

226
00:26:28,536 --> 00:26:31,664
Don't lose it. If he doesn't show
in an hour, give him another call.

227
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,501
You can handle that, right?

228
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,233
- Yeah.
- You got any money?

229
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:39,704
Here's 12 bucks.
Damn, kid, put it in your pocket.

230
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:41,644
See you.

231
00:28:42,504 --> 00:28:44,165
Get on the sidewalk.

232
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:28,208
Yeah.

233
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:50,534
Okay, citizen. You paid. Any requests?

234
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,172
No.

235
00:29:53,608 --> 00:29:54,973
Alrighty, then.

236
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,875
Back off. Away, away. Yo, son,
you're messing with my equilibrium.

237
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:35,311
Nobody touches this instrument but me.
Roxy's my girl.

238
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:38,077
Son, we done here,
so why don't you go find your mommy.

239
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:41,181
- I don't know where she is.
- Good, that's just great.

240
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,149
Cops show up around 6.
Tell them you're AWOL.

241
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:46,225
They'll send you back
where you come from.

242
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:47,759
I don't wanna go back there.

243
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,086
Well, good.

244
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,665
This day's been a bust, anyway. I'm out.

245
00:31:14,255 --> 00:31:15,313
What?

246
00:31:17,592 --> 00:31:19,219
I don't have a place to stay.

247
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:22,552
Do I look like a real-estate tycoon
to you?

248
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:27,964
How many dead presidents you got?

249
00:31:28,536 --> 00:31:30,834
Nuggets? Shorts?

250
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:32,404
Show me the money.

251
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:41,478
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- No, I'm thinking something else.

252
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:45,879
I'm gonna let you buy me a pizza.

253
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:05,336
I've been doing this for 10 years, Bob.
I said 10 percent.

254
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,907
We need to close the deal.
Hold on a second.

255
00:32:09,077 --> 00:32:12,308
No. We said 10 percent.

256
00:32:13,214 --> 00:32:16,206
Yeah, well, it makes the world go round,
doesn't it, Bob?

257
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,551
Just get me the 10 percent, will you?

258
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:21,211
Thanks.

259
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:28,324
- Need anything, sir?
- Do you know any hit men?

260
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:31,056
I do know a bass player
might be able to help you out.

261
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,257
Likes to get in fights with lead singers.

262
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:36,562
Nick?

263
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:40,307
What are you doing, man?

264
00:32:41,843 --> 00:32:44,744
Still driving. Paying off
those wedding bills from last year.

265
00:32:44,912 --> 00:32:47,403
Oh, fair play to you. Oh, she's a nice girl.

266
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:50,545
So you playing at all?

267
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:52,145
Nope.

268
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,445
Why the hell not? Your fingers fall off?

269
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:57,420
Well, you move on.

270
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:02,663
What about the lads?
Seen any of them lately?

271
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:05,932
We still mess around...

272
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,059
...but the Connelly Brothers never really
bounced back minus one brother.

273
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,099
You seen Marshall lately?

274
00:33:17,045 --> 00:33:18,512
Have you?

275
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:23,308
It's my birthday on Saturday.

276
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,944
Session's at my place.
Come, bring your girlfriend.

277
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:29,915
It's great seeing you, man.

278
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,891
Reminds me of New York.
The good old days, eh?

279
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:44,695
I know.

280
00:33:44,872 --> 00:33:47,102
I know.

281
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,676
I know. Okay, I don't know.

282
00:33:50,878 --> 00:33:54,075
"Für Elise" by Beethoven.
And you should know that one.

283
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:56,307
Oh, yeah.

284
00:33:56,484 --> 00:33:58,952
Will you be our teacher forever,
Miss Novacek?

285
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,112
Well, at least until your old teacher
comes back.

286
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,555
But only if you call me...?

287
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:07,957
- Lyla.
- That's right.

288
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,596
You're crazy, Miss Novacek.

289
00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:11,026
- Megan.
- Got everything?

290
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:15,465
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Bye.

291
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,865
Hi, sweetie.

292
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:22,399
Did you have a good day?

293
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,005
Thanks.

294
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,373
- There you are.
- Hey.

295
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:30,244
Okay, now, before you say no...
Okay, picture this.

296
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:34,650
You on stage, me accompanying,
thousands of people.

297
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,289
- Liz.
- The New York Philharmonic.

298
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:39,290
I just got the invite. They want you back.

299
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,190
It's just one night,
but they want you back.

300
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:45,926
I don't wanna be up there.

301
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,590
Lyla...

302
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:50,666
When are you gonna let yourself
be happy again?

303
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,204
I am happy.

304
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:57,341
I'm talking about
when everyone else goes home.

305
00:35:04,318 --> 00:35:06,149
Look...

306
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,845
I know. Okay? I know.

307
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:11,722
Just think about it.

308
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:16,523
I mean, you're a music teacher
who doesn't play music anymore.

309
00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:18,898
Call me crazy.

310
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:20,693
Okay, Crazy.

311
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,428
- I'll see you at home, okay?
- All right.

312
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:37,273
No, I ain't got no daddy.

313
00:35:38,786 --> 00:35:40,048
See, my pops is a drunk.

314
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,816
And my mama, she took off
with this crackhead named Little Jesus.

315
00:35:43,991 --> 00:35:47,256
But, you know, he wasn't no little Jesus,
you know what I'm saying?

316
00:35:47,428 --> 00:35:50,829
No, they never gave a damn about me.

317
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:54,900
Come on, man. This is us right here.

318
00:35:57,004 --> 00:35:59,939
- I've been with Wizard for years.
- Who's Wizard?

319
00:36:00,107 --> 00:36:02,473
Oh, he's a real piece of work,
that's what he is.

320
00:36:02,643 --> 00:36:05,203
His real name's Maxwell Wallace.

321
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:08,507
He took me in.
He said that I was an investment.

322
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:11,777
He gave me Roxy here.
He bought it in the old days.

323
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,553
Well, he really didn't buy it.
Guess you'd kind of say he found it.

324
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:17,020
All right, he stole it.

325
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:19,352
Wizard?
He gave me his place at the Square.

326
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:22,018
My parents? They ain't gave me nothing.

327
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,500
We all gonna be big stars someday.

328
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:31,699
- What's the password?
- Open the damn door already.

329
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:34,770
You're getting on my nerves with that.

330
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:41,272
Okay, follow me.

331
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:47,654
What's your name again?
It's Evan, right?

332
00:36:49,056 --> 00:36:51,422
Yo, this is our home, son.

333
00:36:51,592 --> 00:36:54,390
It's kind of crazy in here,
so stay on your feet.

334
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,124
Watch out.

335
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,496
Yeah, I've been living here for a while.
Come on, man.

336
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:03,398
Hey, check it out.

337
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:05,061
- How much you make?
- Ten dollars.

338
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,173
- You lying. Let me see.
- I am not lying.

339
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:09,309
What did I tell you about that?

340
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:14,647
- Hey, it's Arthur.
- I'll be laughing at your funeral.

341
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,874
- I'm gonna go play basketball.
- All clear.

342
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:26,019
Man, you should've knocked him
in his head, son.

343
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:38,769
Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it!

344
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:45,110
Pizza!

345
00:37:50,217 --> 00:37:52,276
Pizza, pizza, pizza.

346
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,066
Don't make me come up there.

347
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:10,328
Yo, you better hurry
before Wizard shows.

348
00:38:10,504 --> 00:38:13,064
He'll be pissed
if he's seen you bought a pie.

349
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:15,102
I ain't take no family money.

350
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:16,573
Citizen bought it.

351
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,576
<i>Hola</i>, music lovers.

352
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,581
While the cat's away...

353
00:38:26,954 --> 00:38:28,251
Who likes pizza?

354
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:31,788
Who did this?

355
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,656
Arthur?

356
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:42,727
- What is he?
- He's a damn fool.

357
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,337
He's a damn fool.

358
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:47,133
He's gonna get it good.

359
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:49,139
What are you, Arthur?

360
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:51,577
I'm a real piece of work, Wizard.

361
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,942
You're on thin ice.

362
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:59,442
I didn't take no family money.
He bought it.

363
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,158
What?

364
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:07,824
You look crazy.

365
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:10,589
I am crazy.

366
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:15,367
See?

367
00:39:16,237 --> 00:39:17,295
Come here.

368
00:39:20,174 --> 00:39:21,698
Now!

369
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,443
Come on.

370
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,717
- What's your name?
- Evan, sir.

371
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,850
What are you doing here?

372
00:39:33,654 --> 00:39:35,451
I followed the music.

373
00:39:40,928 --> 00:39:44,193
Where did you pick this one up,
Arthur, Bellevue?

374
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,668
You never played a note in your life.

375
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:52,863
Do you know what music is?

376
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:58,672
It's God's little reminder there's
something else besides us in this universe.

377
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:04,845
Harmonic connection between
all living beings everywhere, even the stars.

378
00:40:05,586 --> 00:40:07,486
Is this a school?

379
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,886
Yeah, the school of
Screw You and Take All Your Damn Money.

380
00:40:11,058 --> 00:40:12,923
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're top of the class.

381
00:40:13,094 --> 00:40:14,459
Not!

382
00:40:16,864 --> 00:40:18,354
It's a business.

383
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,595
- Pockets.
- Okay, let's go.

384
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:25,398
- Let's go, let's go.
- Pockets.

385
00:40:26,273 --> 00:40:27,399
Oh, man. Get up.

386
00:40:31,545 --> 00:40:32,773
Peanut, well done.

387
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,709
I got eyes in the back of my head.

388
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,117
Good job.

389
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:40,947
Chain is only as strong...

390
00:40:41,388 --> 00:40:42,685
...as its weakest link.

391
00:40:45,392 --> 00:40:46,882
Come on, Arthur.

392
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:48,786
That's chump change.

393
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:52,296
You got Washington Square.
That was my spot for 10 years.

394
00:40:56,437 --> 00:40:59,565
Go ahead, before I change my mind.

395
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,039
You kids are gonna put me
in the poorhouse.

396
00:41:07,014 --> 00:41:09,949
All right, little mice,
scurry back to your holes. Go, go.

397
00:41:12,586 --> 00:41:15,419
Harmonic dreams, sweet children.

398
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:47,633
Roxanne. Man, I'm gonna kill him.

399
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:17,903
You know what's out there?

400
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:20,666
A series of higher tones.

401
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:22,365
It's arranged by nature.

402
00:44:22,543 --> 00:44:26,604
It's governed by the laws of physics
of the whole universe.

403
00:44:28,015 --> 00:44:30,415
It's an overtone, it's an energy,
it's a wavelength.

404
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:35,112
And if you're not riding it, good Lordy,
you'll never hear it.

405
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:37,314
Where do you think it comes from?

406
00:44:39,126 --> 00:44:40,423
What I hear.

407
00:44:41,028 --> 00:44:44,520
I think it comes from all around you, really.
I mean, it's...

408
00:44:44,698 --> 00:44:46,529
Comes through us, some of us.

409
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,829
It's invisible, but... But you feel it.

410
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,536
So only some of us can hear it?

411
00:44:56,176 --> 00:44:58,144
Only some of us are listening.

412
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,280
Do you think my parents are listening?

413
00:45:04,151 --> 00:45:06,119
I hear you, kid.

414
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,688
Like?

415
00:45:12,192 --> 00:45:13,784
Yeah.

416
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:20,359
Are you hearing a word I'm saying?

417
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,069
Louis.

418
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,672
Come on.
It's about time I met your family.

419
00:45:33,213 --> 00:45:36,705
Listen, Jen,
maybe this isn't such a good idea.

420
00:45:37,684 --> 00:45:38,708
Grow up.

421
00:45:39,186 --> 00:45:40,653
Come on.

422
00:45:42,556 --> 00:45:43,818
- Come on.
- "Grow up."

423
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:51,891
- Are all Irish people this loud?
- Yeah.

424
00:46:16,056 --> 00:46:17,546
Hey, Louis.

425
00:46:24,465 --> 00:46:26,865
Hey, Marshall, your brother's here.

426
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:28,291
Louis.

427
00:46:31,004 --> 00:46:32,471
Hey, Nick.

428
00:46:34,975 --> 00:46:36,636
Oh, my God.

429
00:46:38,111 --> 00:46:39,476
Is that you?

430
00:46:41,815 --> 00:46:44,306
When were you gonna tell me
you're in a band?

431
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,121
I'm sure there's a lot of things
our Louis hasn't told you, darling.

432
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:53,282
- Who did you write the song for?
- I told you this is a mistake.

433
00:46:53,827 --> 00:46:56,421
That's it, go on. Walk out on us again.

434
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,663
- Eh, Lou?
- Say what you gotta say, Marshall.

435
00:47:01,835 --> 00:47:03,803
- Say what you have to say.
- No, go on.

436
00:47:03,971 --> 00:47:06,064
- Come on, say it.
- That the best you got?

437
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,901
- Say it.
- That the best you got?

438
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,305
- Come on. Hit me. Come on, hit me.
- Come on.

439
00:47:10,477 --> 00:47:12,638
Feel what? Come on. Hit me.

440
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:15,278
I'm suffocating here.

441
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,579
You all right, man?

442
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:27,354
You all right, man?

443
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:29,757
Welcome to the Connelly clan.

444
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,098
Jennifer.

445
00:48:04,531 --> 00:48:07,466
You know, it was good
having the old Louis back in there...

446
00:48:08,001 --> 00:48:10,367
...even if it was only for a second.

447
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:13,829
Louie...

448
00:48:14,274 --> 00:48:16,936
...aren't you supposed to be in the car
with the girl...

449
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:19,271
...as she drives off into the sunset?

450
00:48:27,754 --> 00:48:30,314
You'll get your suit dirty
sitting there, man.

451
00:48:44,705 --> 00:48:46,730
<i>This is a message for Lyla Novacek.</i>

452
00:48:46,907 --> 00:48:49,034
<i>Please call Good Samaritan Hospital.</i>

453
00:48:49,209 --> 00:48:52,667
<i>I'm calling about your father,</i>
<i>Thomas Novacek.</i>

454
00:49:02,289 --> 00:49:04,621
I wasn't sure you were going to come.

455
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:08,193
My will is in the top drawer
of the desk in my study.

456
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,887
Dad, stop, come on.

457
00:49:11,064 --> 00:49:13,225
Lyla, please.

458
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,197
There's more.

459
00:49:21,975 --> 00:49:27,709
All I ever wanted was for you
to have all that promise, all that life.

460
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,149
But you were so young.

461
00:49:30,584 --> 00:49:32,677
We had so much work to do.

462
00:49:32,853 --> 00:49:36,118
- You weren't ready.
- That's plenty, Dad. Really.

463
00:49:36,923 --> 00:49:38,982
I mean, a baby.

464
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:40,990
That baby, he could have hurt you.

465
00:49:44,097 --> 00:49:48,397
He could've hurt you, and I...
I wasn't gonna let that happen, Lyla.

466
00:49:53,874 --> 00:49:55,967
I made a choice for us.

467
00:49:59,813 --> 00:50:01,678
Oh, my God.

468
00:50:03,717 --> 00:50:04,945
<i>A choice for us.</i>

469
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,478
Wait...

470
00:50:13,627 --> 00:50:15,322
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

471
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,497
Where?

472
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:26,402
Where is he?

473
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:30,768
- I didn't mean...
- Where is he?

474
00:50:31,211 --> 00:50:32,439
I don't know.

475
00:50:34,481 --> 00:50:36,142
I don't.

476
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,787
<i>You gotta love music</i>
<i>more than you love food.</i>

477
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:52,392
More than life. More than yourself.

478
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,033
You feel it?

479
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,667
Then show me.

480
00:51:05,412 --> 00:51:07,380
Play it for your parents.

481
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,454
You're flying, kid.

482
00:52:08,508 --> 00:52:10,066
Yeah!

483
00:52:10,243 --> 00:52:12,370
You know what I'm thinking?

484
00:52:13,246 --> 00:52:15,806
You're supposed to say,
"What are you thinking, Wizard?"

485
00:52:15,982 --> 00:52:18,280
"What are you thinking, Wizard?"

486
00:52:18,451 --> 00:52:20,885
I teach you everything I know for free.

487
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,955
You get Roxanne.
You get my corner of the park.

488
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,792
You get to keep half your tips.
We're like a team.

489
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:31,297
There's something wrong
with that picture.

490
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:32,789
What?

491
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,900
I don't think performing in parks
and street corners is gonna be enough.

492
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,298
It won't?

493
00:52:41,474 --> 00:52:44,807
Evan, we're gonna need
to get you a new name.

494
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:46,741
Something with a little more pop.

495
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,775
What do you wanna be in the world?
In the whole world, what do you wanna be?

496
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:53,078
Close your eyes and think about that.

497
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,745
Found.

498
00:53:01,995 --> 00:53:03,360
Doesn't have enough yin.

499
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,257
- Little more yang, you know?
- Yeah.

500
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,298
Yeah, let's...

501
00:53:09,502 --> 00:53:13,461
Talk about wishful thinking. Look at that.

502
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,669
What name stands out to you
on that, huh?

503
00:53:18,845 --> 00:53:19,869
Beach?

504
00:53:20,046 --> 00:53:22,480
It's a good name for a band,
but not for a performer.

505
00:53:22,649 --> 00:53:25,584
You can't say, "Please welcome Beach."
No, no.

506
00:53:25,752 --> 00:53:30,052
August Rush. August Rush.
Doesn't that warm you up a little bit?

507
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:33,823
I can see it.
"Wizard Productions presents...

508
00:53:33,994 --> 00:53:36,861
...the number-one heat wave:

509
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:40,488
August Rush!"

510
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:43,227
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Me!

511
00:53:43,403 --> 00:53:46,065
- August, August, August.
- It gives me a rush.

512
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:49,538
That gives me chills. The hair
on the back of my neck's standing up.

513
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:51,176
- Really?
- Yeah, look at that.

514
00:53:51,344 --> 00:53:52,777
Quick, check it out. Yeah.

515
00:53:52,946 --> 00:53:56,575
- I'm flying! I'm flying!
- Yeah. August! August Rush.

516
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:59,048
- August.
- August Rush. August Rush.

00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:00,243
That's you.

- <i>August. August.</i>
- <i>August Rush, August Rush.</i>

<i>What are you doing in New York?</i>

520
00:54:51,171 --> 00:54:53,935
Lizzy, I mean,
I've always felt that he was alive.

521
00:54:54,107 --> 00:54:59,409
I'd see kids that would be his age
and I'd imagine what he'd look like.

522
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:02,343
- Big blue eyes like his dad and...
- <i>Oh, my God, Lyla.</i>

523
00:55:02,515 --> 00:55:06,952
Lizzy, I used to lie in bed at night
and I swear I could hear him.

524
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,089
- I swear I could hear him.
- <i>Lyla, calm down.</i>

525
00:55:10,256 --> 00:55:13,919
Calm down? How can I be calm?
How can I be calm?

526
00:55:14,094 --> 00:55:17,359
I've been calm for over 10 years
and look where it's gotten me.

527
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:20,021
<i>Lyla, you're losing it.</i>

528
00:55:20,266 --> 00:55:23,497
You're right. And maybe it's about time.

529
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:25,365
<i>Don't do anything crazy, okay?</i>

530
00:55:25,538 --> 00:55:29,872
<i>We're on our honeymoon, but we're leaving.</i>
<i>We'll get there as soon as we can, okay?</i>

531
00:55:49,295 --> 00:55:52,162
Okay, Jack, he's worth three times
what you're offering him.

532
00:55:52,332 --> 00:55:54,129
- Wallace...
- You heard him in the park!

533
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,562
You're a pain in the ass.

534
00:55:55,735 --> 00:55:59,136
- Two-fifty if he can play for two hours.
- No, five or he walks.

535
00:55:59,305 --> 00:56:04,106
- Five hundred? I'll give him 250...
- Five hundred or he walks, all right?

536
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:07,678
- He walks?
- We have lightning in a bottle, Jack.

537
00:56:07,847 --> 00:56:10,372
No, there's no parents. I'm his guardian.

538
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:13,747
No, I'm his representation,
that's why I'm making the deal.

539
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,649
May I help you?

540
00:56:16,056 --> 00:56:18,286
- I'm trying to find my son.
- Hold on a second.

541
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:20,686
Name?

542
00:56:25,999 --> 00:56:27,990
Mommy.

543
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,741
Mommy.

544
00:56:38,578 --> 00:56:40,045
I don't know.

545
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:44,041
- Mom.
- Mommy.

546
00:56:54,094 --> 00:56:56,221
Mommy, look at me.

547
00:56:56,396 --> 00:56:58,887
I'm sorry, ma'am, we're closing.

548
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:04,033
Please, I just... I wanna know his name.

549
00:57:04,804 --> 00:57:10,003
To even consider re-establishing contact
with a child, there is a detailed process.

550
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:14,840
I don't care about your process! Okay?

551
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:35,524
Ma'am, we're closed.
Come back tomorrow.

552
00:57:39,072 --> 00:57:40,801
<i>Lyla.</i>

553
00:57:41,841 --> 00:57:43,308
<i>Novacek.</i>

554
00:57:46,246 --> 00:57:48,714
- <i>Hi, this is Lyla</i>...
- <i>And Lizzy.</i>

555
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,942
<i>And we're not here right now,</i>
<i>so leave a message.</i>

556
00:58:12,172 --> 00:58:13,696
Arthur!

557
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,804
What'd I tell you
about talking to strangers?

558
00:58:16,976 --> 00:58:20,434
- Yeah, what's your name?
- My name is Mr. Jeffries, and yours?

559
00:58:20,947 --> 00:58:23,177
Arthur. We ain't strangers now.

560
00:58:23,716 --> 00:58:27,914
Look, Mr. Wallace,
I'm here making my normal rounds.

561
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,645
I'm trying to find these kids.

562
00:58:29,822 --> 00:58:33,053
This girl, her name is Geralda.
She should be about 14 now.

563
00:58:33,226 --> 00:58:34,659
Don't know her, Mr. Jeffries.

564
00:58:34,827 --> 00:58:37,853
Okay, well, maybe you can help me
with this young man.

565
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:41,933
Little boy that came up missing recently
and his name is Evan Taylor.

566
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,930
He's about 12.

567
00:58:47,073 --> 00:58:50,702
And what if I find this Evan
and I turn him over to you?

568
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:55,179
What then? You don't care about a kid
after he's in the system.

569
00:58:55,348 --> 00:58:58,943
- It's not like that...
- Oh, I know exactly what it's like.

570
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:03,111
You don't follow up.
And you throw him from place to place.

571
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:06,884
Eventually, you end up in a place
where they kick the crap out of you.

572
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:11,957
Go to bed at night
and he tries to close his eyes, ears.

573
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,826
Shut out the world.

574
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,527
What happens to that kid?
What do you think he hears?

575
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,832
What do you think he hears?

576
00:59:21,574 --> 00:59:23,701
- Nothing.
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

577
00:59:27,447 --> 00:59:28,573
Are you all right?

578
00:59:29,182 --> 00:59:30,740
- Yeah, I'm cool.
- He's good.

579
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,718
<i>Fourteenth Precinct, Sergeant O'Malley.</i>

580
00:59:42,528 --> 00:59:45,895
No. That doesn't cut it.

581
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,727
No! Oh, is that final?

582
00:59:50,903 --> 00:59:54,304
Okay, well, here's my final offer:
we're history!

583
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:57,468
- Deal's off.
- But I wanna play.

584
00:59:57,644 --> 01:00:00,613
You play when I say play.
You breathe when I say breathe.

585
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,408
- You got that, boy?
- But I have to play.

586
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:05,710
Wizard, I need them to hear.

587
01:00:05,885 --> 01:00:10,845
You forget about your parents!
They were pretty quick to forget about you.

588
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,130
You don't know how it could be for you.

589
01:00:19,299 --> 01:00:22,132
You do not know how precious
your gift is.

590
01:00:22,302 --> 01:00:25,032
You're just a kid, you don't know.

591
01:00:29,776 --> 01:00:32,006
I do, August.

592
01:00:46,993 --> 01:00:49,223
- <i>Wizard. Wizard.</i>
- <i>Talk to me. What happened?</i>

593
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:52,956
- It's Arthur. The cops chased him here.
- Okay, split up. You know the drill.

594
01:00:53,132 --> 01:00:55,623
- We gotta help Arty.
- Forget Arty. Arty's on his own.

595
01:00:55,802 --> 01:00:57,793
- That's the book.
- No.

596
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:00,268
- August!
- Grab him. Grab him. There he goes.

597
01:01:01,274 --> 01:01:02,764
He went outside over there.

598
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:19,255
Up there. You see him?
See him? Look, over there.

599
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,256
- Hey, kid, don't move.
- Hey, you!

600
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,987
Cops. Cops.

601
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:26,689
Cops. Over here.

602
01:01:29,335 --> 01:01:32,065
Grab that kid over there.
Grab him, grab him.

603
01:01:38,745 --> 01:01:40,940
Listen, you can't let the cops catch you.

604
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,514
If they do,
you don't tell them your real name...

605
01:01:43,683 --> 01:01:47,119
...because they'll send you right back
where you came from, you got that?

606
01:01:47,987 --> 01:01:49,352
I don't wanna lose you...

607
01:01:49,522 --> 01:01:51,888
...but if we get separated,
we meet at the arch.

608
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,657
Do not tell them your name.

609
01:01:55,828 --> 01:02:00,891
Hey, when I say run, you run, okay?

610
01:02:07,707 --> 01:02:08,901
Let me see your hands.

611
01:02:11,911 --> 01:02:16,143
- Run, August. Run, August. Run!
- Hey, kid.

612
01:02:26,959 --> 01:02:27,983
Hey, kid, stop.

613
01:02:34,467 --> 01:02:36,128
Open the door.

614
01:05:15,227 --> 01:05:17,320
- Hi.
- Hi.

615
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:22,233
I know how this looks, you know.
I'm not crazy.

616
01:05:22,401 --> 01:05:25,495
Nobody thinks you're crazy.
What's your name?

617
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,901
Lyla Novacek.

618
01:05:28,074 --> 01:05:30,042
Well, it's like
the woman explained to you.

619
01:05:30,209 --> 01:05:32,769
- You fill out a couple forms...
- Six months, they said.

620
01:05:32,945 --> 01:05:36,312
I don't have six months for forms.

621
01:05:36,482 --> 01:05:38,575
Then I can't help you, then.

622
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:42,245
Explain something to me now. Why now?

623
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:46,719
Why not before? Why is it so important
that you want him now?

624
01:05:47,927 --> 01:05:50,122
I've always wanted him.

625
01:05:52,498 --> 01:05:56,400
I've waited 11 years, two months,
and 15 days...

626
01:05:57,336 --> 01:05:59,964
...to find out that he's alive.

627
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,873
I've been counting.

628
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:24,161
- <i>Hi, this is Lyla</i>...
- <i>And Lizzy.</i>

629
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:27,299
<i>And we're not here right now,</i>
<i>so leave a message.</i>

630
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:48,748
What are you waiting for?

631
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:51,651
You see, I know this girl
that lives across the street.

632
01:06:51,824 --> 01:06:52,848
Lyla Novacek.

633
01:06:53,025 --> 01:06:55,118
I've been standing outside here waiting.

634
01:06:55,294 --> 01:06:56,659
I wrote her a song.

635
01:06:56,829 --> 01:07:00,287
Oh, the musician.
She keeps me up half the night.

636
01:07:00,466 --> 01:07:04,664
Well, I haven't seen her in a few days.
She's off on her honeymoon.

637
01:07:07,073 --> 01:07:08,802
Thanks.

638
01:07:49,615 --> 01:07:51,742
And this isn't your signature?

639
01:07:53,185 --> 01:07:58,054
You do realize that he's probably
already been placed with a family, correct?

640
01:07:58,224 --> 01:08:00,658
Do you have children, Mr. Jeffries?

641
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:10,833
Yeah, I did.

642
01:08:12,705 --> 01:08:14,229
Then you know.

643
01:08:22,081 --> 01:08:23,343
What's his birthday?

644
01:08:23,983 --> 01:08:26,349
December 17th, 1995.

645
01:08:28,053 --> 01:08:29,213
Yeah, I know.

646
01:08:41,834 --> 01:08:43,995
Excuse me a minute.

647
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:13,926
This is him.

648
01:09:18,604 --> 01:09:20,128
Yeah.

649
01:09:59,879 --> 01:10:01,938
You the one slept under my bed?

650
01:10:07,253 --> 01:10:08,311
Do you live here?

651
01:10:08,921 --> 01:10:11,116
Me and my grandma do,
till our boat comes in.

652
01:10:14,326 --> 01:10:15,554
Do you like music?

653
01:10:17,096 --> 01:10:18,154
More than food.

654
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:23,062
Do you know your notes?

655
01:10:24,403 --> 01:10:26,303
I've never seen them like that before.

656
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,064
See here:

657
01:10:28,908 --> 01:10:33,811
"Every Good Boy Does Fine"
on the lines.

658
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:39,383
And "F, A, C, E" in between.

659
01:10:39,551 --> 01:10:43,078
And "Great Big Dogs Fight Animals."

660
01:10:43,255 --> 01:10:48,215
And "All Cars Eat Gas." Get it?

661
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:50,651
You're like an angel.

662
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:53,226
Okay. I gotta go.

663
01:10:53,699 --> 01:10:55,394
Gotta go to school.

664
01:11:00,706 --> 01:11:02,435
Can I borrow this?

665
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:04,836
Later.

666
01:12:32,364 --> 01:12:34,025
Holy...

667
01:12:37,302 --> 01:12:39,497
Reverend J.!

668
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:10,631
You're not gonna believe this,
Reverend J. Come quick.

669
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,704
- Slow down, Hope.
- You've gotta see what's happened.

670
01:13:34,693 --> 01:13:37,321
Remember in Music Appreciation
we had a class on Mozart?

671
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:38,520
Yes.

672
01:13:38,697 --> 01:13:40,722
Remember you said
he was like a musical pod?

673
01:13:40,899 --> 01:13:42,833
- Prodigy.
- Exactly.

674
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:45,902
Well, I have one of those,
and he's living under my bed.

675
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:57,808
So I showed him the scales
and when I came home, he was...

676
01:14:30,516 --> 01:14:33,952
<i>Mr. Jeffries, hi, it's Lyla Novacek again.</i>

677
01:14:34,119 --> 01:14:36,952
<i>I was just checking in.</i>

678
01:14:39,424 --> 01:14:40,823
<i>Right, I understand.</i>

679
01:14:40,993 --> 01:14:44,121
<i>You know,</i>
<i>if there's any more information or</i>...

680
01:14:44,296 --> 01:14:46,127
<i>Yeah, just call.</i>

681
01:14:59,845 --> 01:15:01,506
I'll take it.

682
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,274
How long do you think you'll be staying?

683
01:15:05,317 --> 01:15:07,808
<i>As long as it takes.</i>

684
01:15:28,807 --> 01:15:30,365
Sorry.

685
01:15:30,542 --> 01:15:33,238
<i>I don't know, Lizzy, it's like...</i>

686
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:35,443
<i>... I just woke up...</i>

687
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,946
<i>... and I should start playing again.</i>

688
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:40,016
<i>I should play.</i>

689
01:15:40,485 --> 01:15:43,818
<i>I know it sounds crazy,</i>
<i>but maybe he'll hear me.</i>

690
01:15:59,938 --> 01:16:02,805
<i>Hey, Marshall. It's me.</i>

691
01:16:04,409 --> 01:16:06,274
<i>I'm in New York.</i>

692
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,505
<i>Is the band still minus</i>
<i>one mad Connelly brother?</i>

693
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:14,314
<i>Having you guys here,</i>
<i>it'd be great, you know?</i>

694
01:16:15,721 --> 01:16:17,086
<i>Just an idea.</i>

695
01:16:17,256 --> 01:16:20,054
Hey, Frank. It's Louis.

696
01:16:20,425 --> 01:16:22,256
Louis Connelly.

697
01:16:22,427 --> 01:16:23,860
And?

698
01:16:24,029 --> 01:16:26,520
I played here with me band
a couple of years ago.

699
01:16:26,698 --> 01:16:28,689
Well, about 10 years ago.

700
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:33,636
Hey, hey, listen, Frank.

701
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:37,664
I'm gonna play you one song, all right?
Just one song.

702
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:41,472
And if you don't like it,
you can throw me out.

703
01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:00,628
<i>You brought us a prodigy, Reverend.</i>

704
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:03,495
- He is a mystery.
- Here in the "Well-Tempered Clavier"...

705
01:17:03,669 --> 01:17:06,365
Dean, I thought he was an angel.

706
01:17:07,272 --> 01:17:10,537
There's no record of
an August Rush anywhere.

707
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:15,146
It's about foundation,
starting with a very simple, orderly chord.

708
01:17:39,137 --> 01:17:41,731
Lyla, just relax.

709
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:44,239
- This piece.
- You're pushing yourself too hard.

710
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:46,673
I don't know if I can do this.

711
01:17:46,845 --> 01:17:49,370
You're playing with the Philharmonic.

712
01:17:49,548 --> 01:17:51,482
That's great.

713
01:17:53,385 --> 01:17:55,683
Okay, let's keep going.

714
01:18:02,994 --> 01:18:06,657
Start with a C-major chord,
then a modulation to G.

715
01:18:06,832 --> 01:18:09,824
Once we get to G,
we go back to C, very simple.

716
01:18:10,001 --> 01:18:12,765
And we have C, G, C.

717
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:22,379
<i>At the very beginning, C-major chord.</i>

718
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:27,143
<i>We have this chaotic evolution</i>
<i>into a remote G-major.</i>

719
01:18:30,489 --> 01:18:32,480
C-major chord, then move into a G.

720
01:18:41,299 --> 01:18:43,767
What's this, August?

721
01:18:44,069 --> 01:18:46,264
The diminished fifth, sir.

722
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:48,071
Key change here.

723
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:52,677
And then the rise with those round horns,
the oboes...

724
01:18:52,844 --> 01:18:55,244
...into the allegro staccato strings.

725
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,381
Mr. Rush.

726
01:19:06,858 --> 01:19:10,225
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you apologizing, August?

727
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:12,897
Sometimes I don't listen well...

728
01:19:13,064 --> 01:19:15,532
...and I don't do the homework
like I'm supposed to.

729
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,998
Well, I'm sure you'll do better
in the future.

730
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:32,173
The New York Philharmonic Orchestra
is having a concert.

731
01:19:32,818 --> 01:19:36,948
In the history of this school we have never
performed the work of a first-year student...

732
01:19:37,122 --> 01:19:40,023
...and certainly no one of your age.

733
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:44,288
But now, we've asked them
if they could perform your rhapsody.

734
01:19:44,463 --> 01:19:46,021
Would you like that?

735
01:19:46,932 --> 01:19:49,400
Well, good. Good.

736
01:19:49,568 --> 01:19:51,229
How many people will hear it?

737
01:19:54,005 --> 01:19:57,771
Well, it would be performed in Central Park,
on the Great Lawn.

738
01:19:57,943 --> 01:19:58,967
A hundred?

739
01:20:00,145 --> 01:20:02,045
Much more. Thousands.

740
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:07,443
Okay. Because I need to play it
to a lot of people. Lots and lots.

741
01:20:09,087 --> 01:20:10,748
We'll see what we can do to help.

742
01:20:14,493 --> 01:20:19,294
August, three artists will be performing
and you will be featured last.

743
01:20:30,509 --> 01:20:32,306
<i>How do you do it?</i>

744
01:20:32,711 --> 01:20:36,078
How does the music come to you?

745
01:20:38,216 --> 01:20:39,979
<i>I just hear it.</i>

746
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:45,753
Sometimes I wake up and it's there...

747
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:48,757
...or I hear it
when I'm walking down the street.

748
01:20:55,867 --> 01:20:58,427
<i>It's like someone's calling out to me.</i>

749
01:20:59,337 --> 01:21:01,999
Writing it all down
is like I'm calling back to them.

750
01:21:02,173 --> 01:21:03,435
Who?

751
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,138
The ones who gave me the music.

752
01:21:14,486 --> 01:21:17,887
- You sure you're ready for this, Louis?
- Are you?

753
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,874
Bravo, August!

754
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:23,887
Good one!

755
01:22:27,325 --> 01:22:31,523
August, boy, you're a hard guy to find.

756
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:35,355
Been looking everywhere for you.

757
01:22:35,533 --> 01:22:38,969
Excuse me.
You're interrupting a rehearsal here.

758
01:22:39,137 --> 01:22:41,697
- Yeah, rehearsal, right.
- And you are...?

759
01:22:41,873 --> 01:22:43,465
Come here to me, son.

760
01:22:53,251 --> 01:22:54,809
Come here.

761
01:22:57,922 --> 01:22:59,787
What'd they do to you?

762
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:02,883
Nothing.

763
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:07,388
These people can steal your soul.

764
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:10,463
Sir, whomever you are,
you don't have the right.

765
01:23:10,635 --> 01:23:13,570
I'm his father, all right?
I have every right.

766
01:23:17,676 --> 01:23:20,440
I'll take you home now. Come on.

767
01:23:21,046 --> 01:23:24,140
But I have a concert. I like it here.

768
01:23:24,315 --> 01:23:26,840
- He's a remarkable boy...
- You don't think I know that?

769
01:23:27,018 --> 01:23:30,784
What'd you do, you just snatched him up
off the street? That gives you the right?

770
01:23:31,389 --> 01:23:33,653
Wait a moment,
we've been teaching him here.

771
01:23:33,825 --> 01:23:35,053
What are you gonna do?

772
01:23:35,226 --> 01:23:38,923
Fill his head with classical theory
and rules?

773
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:42,066
You can't learn music from books.

774
01:23:42,233 --> 01:23:43,791
It's out there.

775
01:23:45,203 --> 01:23:47,569
You teach him?

776
01:23:48,006 --> 01:23:49,473
He teaches you.

777
01:23:49,641 --> 01:23:51,370
You learn from him.

778
01:23:51,543 --> 01:23:54,034
We are.
I assure you, Mr. Rush, every day.

779
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:56,943
You should be with family. Come on.

780
01:24:00,351 --> 01:24:01,943
Mr. Rush, please.

781
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:06,181
Do you have any idea of the importance
of the concert tomorrow night, for August?

782
01:24:06,991 --> 01:24:08,515
August. Wait, listen.

783
01:24:08,993 --> 01:24:11,860
You gotta tell me right now,
is this man really your father?

784
01:24:16,334 --> 01:24:18,165
You can tell me the truth.

785
01:24:19,337 --> 01:24:21,567
I know your real name.

786
01:24:22,741 --> 01:24:24,140
Evan.

787
01:24:24,743 --> 01:24:26,643
August.

788
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:28,244
Evan.

789
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:32,479
Is he your father?

790
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:39,183
He taught me everything I know.

791
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:53,431
And we are back, we are back.

792
01:24:57,275 --> 01:24:59,607
Don't make it harder for yourself, Aug.

793
01:24:59,778 --> 01:25:02,008
Wizard's not so bad.

794
01:25:03,281 --> 01:25:05,715
You saw the kid, right?
He's a freak of nature. Yeah.

795
01:25:05,884 --> 01:25:09,615
Here's the deal. Thousand a night, two
weeks minimum, three cities guaranteed.

796
01:25:09,788 --> 01:25:12,848
Then we ship him out to your partner
on the West Coast. No.

797
01:25:13,024 --> 01:25:14,889
He just ain't feeling well.

798
01:25:15,894 --> 01:25:19,193
He said you the only one
who gonna make him feel better.

799
01:25:26,304 --> 01:25:29,205
Competition. All right, I'll be back.
You do what you do.

800
01:25:33,111 --> 01:25:35,045
Yo, yo.

801
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:43,547
I'm his representation.
That's why I'm making the deal.

802
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:46,823
Come on. No, there's no parents.

803
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,646
Great sounds, kid.

804
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:23,018
Gibson J-200?

805
01:26:24,562 --> 01:26:26,029
It's beautiful.

806
01:26:26,631 --> 01:26:27,928
Can I see her?

807
01:26:31,369 --> 01:26:34,338
Hey. It's okay.

808
01:26:34,806 --> 01:26:36,865
I'm a musician too.

809
01:26:42,046 --> 01:26:43,570
Yeah.

810
01:26:47,652 --> 01:26:49,347
Oh, yeah.

811
01:27:02,967 --> 01:27:04,298
Nice action.

812
01:27:05,336 --> 01:27:06,667
You're pretty good.

813
01:27:07,872 --> 01:27:09,499
Thanks.

814
01:27:10,441 --> 01:27:12,432
See what you can do with mine.

815
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:08,323
How long you been playing?

816
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,159
Six months.

817
01:29:10,795 --> 01:29:12,592
Six months?

818
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,255
How'd you learn how to play like that
in six months?

819
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:16,491
Juilliard.

820
01:29:18,136 --> 01:29:19,296
Juilliard?

821
01:29:19,804 --> 01:29:21,032
Yes, sir.

822
01:29:21,205 --> 01:29:23,173
I have my own concert tonight.

823
01:29:24,175 --> 01:29:25,836
Do you reckon I should believe you?

824
01:29:26,944 --> 01:29:29,606
Yeah. But I can't go.

825
01:29:30,048 --> 01:29:31,276
Why's that?

826
01:29:32,016 --> 01:29:34,382
It's kind of a long story.

827
01:29:36,721 --> 01:29:41,249
Well, if I went to Juilliard
and I had a concert tonight...

828
01:29:41,426 --> 01:29:43,326
...I wouldn't miss it for the world.

829
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:46,062
Yeah.

830
01:29:51,235 --> 01:29:53,795
But what if something bad
would happen if you did it?

831
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:57,668
You never quit on your music.

832
01:29:58,443 --> 01:30:00,536
No matter what happens.

833
01:30:01,145 --> 01:30:04,842
Because anytime
something bad happens to you...

834
01:30:05,249 --> 01:30:08,548
...it's the one place you can escape to
and just let it go.

835
01:30:10,688 --> 01:30:12,781
I learned that the hard way.

836
01:30:14,425 --> 01:30:16,325
And anyway, look at me.

837
01:30:17,361 --> 01:30:19,693
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

838
01:30:20,398 --> 01:30:22,525
You gotta have a little faith.

839
01:30:33,177 --> 01:30:34,405
I'm Louis.

840
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:37,880
Ev... August.

841
01:30:38,049 --> 01:30:39,710
August Rush.

842
01:30:39,884 --> 01:30:41,943
August Rush.

843
01:30:43,354 --> 01:30:45,686
- Cool name.
- August!

844
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:48,548
Come on!

845
01:30:51,629 --> 01:30:53,426
I gotta go, August.

846
01:30:59,737 --> 01:31:01,227
Bye.

847
01:31:02,006 --> 01:31:03,473
Yeah.

848
01:31:05,309 --> 01:31:06,799
Bye.

849
01:31:16,487 --> 01:31:17,886
Bye.

850
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:39,070
Yes, I made him memorize our number.

851
01:31:41,646 --> 01:31:45,082
I understand. Your department's
doing everything they can.

852
01:32:04,068 --> 01:32:06,628
Do you think anything bad
happened to him?

853
01:32:07,738 --> 01:32:09,000
I'm sure he's fine.

854
01:32:10,074 --> 01:32:12,634
I prayed for him. Did you?

855
01:32:13,411 --> 01:32:15,072
Yeah.

856
01:32:16,247 --> 01:32:22,948
Well, if his father loves him like he should,
then he'll do what's best for his son.

857
01:32:24,855 --> 01:32:26,482
You believe that, don't you?

858
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:30,256
- Yeah.
- Good.

859
01:32:30,561 --> 01:32:32,426
Now go get ready.

860
01:32:43,407 --> 01:32:45,841
<i>Welcome to our Concert in the Park...</i>

861
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:51,373
...and the Mercedes Drive Your Future
Scholarship Celebration.

862
01:32:51,549 --> 01:32:54,211
And now it is with enormous pleasure...

863
01:32:54,385 --> 01:33:01,018
...that I welcome back to the concert stage
one of Juilliard's own, Lyla Novacek.

864
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:07,178
I have to go now.

865
01:35:19,096 --> 01:35:20,893
I'm not coming back this time.

866
01:35:22,533 --> 01:35:23,864
He's just kidding, Wizard.

867
01:35:25,469 --> 01:35:28,199
Me and August have a understanding.
Don't we?

868
01:35:33,344 --> 01:35:35,539
Aug, you can't leave me, man.

869
01:35:35,713 --> 01:35:37,476
Yes, I can.

870
01:35:38,716 --> 01:35:40,843
Because you have to
find your parents, right?

871
01:35:41,018 --> 01:35:43,782
Yeah. My concert's starting.

872
01:35:43,954 --> 01:35:49,017
Well, all my money's on the fact
your folks won't be able to find you.

873
01:35:49,193 --> 01:35:50,524
You know why?

874
01:35:50,928 --> 01:35:52,828
Because they can't hear you.

875
01:35:53,264 --> 01:35:54,595
They're probably dead.

876
01:35:54,765 --> 01:35:56,960
You're not going anywhere.

877
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,238
Nowhere to go, son.

878
01:36:21,292 --> 01:36:23,055
Run, boy.

879
01:36:23,227 --> 01:36:24,751
Run, August, run.

880
01:36:45,883 --> 01:36:48,351
August!

881
01:37:38,469 --> 01:37:40,994
August!

882
01:38:01,358 --> 01:38:03,986
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

883
01:38:04,361 --> 01:38:10,163
Music has always fascinated us
in the way that it communicates.

884
01:38:10,334 --> 01:38:13,360
Without words, without pictures.

885
01:38:14,271 --> 01:38:17,138
And that leads us
to our final performance.

886
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,473
How much longer to the airport?

887
01:38:23,647 --> 01:38:26,138
Man, it jams up the traffic.

888
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:28,808
Bring you back to the old days,
eh, Louis?

889
01:38:46,537 --> 01:38:48,334
"August Rush."

890
01:38:48,505 --> 01:38:50,336
Evan Taylor.

891
01:39:06,056 --> 01:39:10,720
Unfortunately, our last performer
seems to have...

892
01:39:10,894 --> 01:39:13,761
He's here. He's here. He's here.

893
01:39:15,165 --> 01:39:16,257
Excellent.

894
01:39:16,433 --> 01:39:23,362
Perhaps there's no one else who can
better personify the mystery that is music...

895
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:26,270
...than our final composer.

896
01:41:18,021 --> 01:41:19,511
Hey, what's that?

897
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:22,284
Concerts in the Park every spring.

898
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:51,681
Let me out.

899
01:41:52,890 --> 01:41:55,290
Let me out! Let me out!

900
01:46:38,508 --> 01:46:41,033
<i>The music is all around us.</i>

901
01:46:41,211 --> 01:46:44,840
<i>All you have to do is listen.</i>

902
01:52:26,289 --> 01:52:29,918
<i>Bamba, bamba</i>

903
01:52:30,794 --> 01:52:34,286
<i>Oh, bamba, bamba</i>

904
01:52:34,464 --> 01:52:36,523
<i>Para bailar la bamba</i>

905
01:52:36,699 --> 01:52:39,532
<i>Bamba, bamba</i>

906
01:52:39,702 --> 01:52:42,762
- <i>Para bailar la bamba</i>
- <i>Bamba, bamba</i>

907
01:52:42,939 --> 01:52:48,309
<i>Se necesita una poca de gracia</i>

908
01:52:48,478 --> 01:52:49,911
<i>Bamba, bamba</i>

909
01:52:50,079 --> 01:52:55,142
<i>Una poca de gracia pa mi pa ti</i>

910
01:52:55,318 --> 01:52:57,786
<i>Y arriba, y arriba</i>

911
01:52:57,954 --> 01:53:00,354
<i>Bamba, bamba</i>

912
01:53:00,523 --> 01:53:02,718
<i>Yeah, dance with me, baby</i>

913
01:53:02,892 --> 01:53:03,950
<i>Bamba, bamba</i>

914
01:53:04,127 --> 01:53:05,822
<i>Let's dance tonight</i>

915
01:53:05,995 --> 01:53:08,259
<i>Say arriba, y arriba</i>

916
01:53:08,431 --> 01:53:11,093
<i>Bamba, bamba</i>

917
01:53:11,267 --> 01:53:13,462
<i>Say arriba, y arriba</i>

918
01:53:13,636 --> 01:53:16,002
