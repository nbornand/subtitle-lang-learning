1
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:41,403
I shall tell you of William Wallace.

2
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:45,402
Historians from England will say I am a liar.

3
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,909
But history is written by those
who have hanged heroes.

4
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:55,789
The King of Scotland had died without a son.
And the King of England,

5
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:59,712
a cruel pagan known as
Edward the Longshanks,

6
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:03,794
claimed the throne of Scotland for himself.

7
00:02:03,888 --> 00:02:06,759
Scotland's nobles fought him

8
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,935
and fought each other over the crown.

9
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:14,263
So Longshanks invited them
to talks of a truce.

10
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:17,313
No weapons. One page only.

11
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,362
One farmer of that shire was Malcolm
Wallace, a commoner with his own lands.

12
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:29,706
He had two sons: John and William.

13
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,626
I told you to stay.

14
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:42,840
Well, I finished my work.
Where are we going?

15
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:46,136
MacAndrews'. He was supposed
to visit after the gathering.

16
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:48,267
- Can I come?
- No. Go home, boy.

17
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:52,056
- But I want to go.
- Go home, or you'll feel the back of my hand.

18
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:54,903
Away hame, William.

19
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:21,007
MacAndrews.

20
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:37,231
Holy Jesus.

21
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:23,912
William.

22
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:30,426
It's all right, it's all right. Easy, lad.

23
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:48,020
William.

24
00:04:50,284 --> 00:04:52,360
And I say we hit back now.

25
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:55,407
- We cannae fight them.
- Something's got to be done.

26
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:58,662
Wallace is right. We fight them.

27
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:01,539
Every nobleman willing to fight
was at that meeting.

28
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,000
We cannot beat an army.
Not with the 50 farmers we can raise.

29
00:05:05,092 --> 00:05:08,129
We do not have to beat them...
Just fight them.

30
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:11,513
- Now, who's with me?
- I am, Wallace.

31
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:15,306
- All right.
- Aye.

32
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:33,238
- Where do you think you're going?
- With you.

33
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:36,951
Och, are ye? And what are you going to do?

34
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,379
- I'm gonna help.
- Aye, and a good help you'll be, too.

35
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,715
But I need you to stay here

36
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:47,924
and look after the place for me
while I'm away.

37
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:52,178
I can fight.

38
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:57,565
I know. I know you can fight.

39
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:05,321
But it's our wits that make us men.

40
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,492
See ye tomorrow.

41
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:45,903
- English.
- Get down.

42
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:50,328
With your father and brother gone,
they'll kill us and burn the farm.

43
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:53,080
It's up to us, Hamish.

44
00:07:57,787 --> 00:07:59,863
Da?

45
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,956
William.

46
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:26,753
Come here, lad.

47
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:54,327
William.

48
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:59,041
I'm your uncle. Argyle.

49
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:14,092
You have the look of your mother.

50
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:29,030
We'll stay here tonight.
Tomorrow, you'll come home with me.

51
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:32,071
I don't want to leave.

52
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:36,289
You didn't want your father
to die either, did you?

53
00:13:36,377 --> 00:13:38,453
But it happened.

54
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:44,419
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

55
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:47,845
- The Lord bless thee and keep thee...
- It was in Latin.

56
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:50,925
You don't speak Latin?

57
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,761
That's something we shall have to remedy.

58
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,318
The Lord

59
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:02,480
bless thee and keep thee.

60
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,742
The Lord cause his light to shine on thee.

61
00:14:06,244 --> 00:14:09,364
The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee

62
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:11,866
and give thee peace.

63
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:14,702
Amen.

64
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:22,753
Your heart is free.

65
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,173
Have the courage to follow it.

66
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:55,832
What are they doing?

67
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:58,001
Saying goodbye in their own way.

68
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:02,505
Playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.

69
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:17,233
It was the same for me and your daddy
when our father was killed.

70
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:47,683
First, learn to use...

71
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,644
this.

72
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:52,813
Then I'll teach you... to use

73
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:56,442
this.

74
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,602
Many years later,

75
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,945
Edward the Longshanks, King of England,

76
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:35,493
supervised the wedding of his eldest son,
who would succeed him as king.

77
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,950
Amen.

78
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,706
As bride for his son,

79
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:49,215
Longshanks had chosen
the daughter of his rival,

80
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:51,379
the King of France.

81
00:17:14,456 --> 00:17:18,039
It was widely whispered
that for the Princess to conceive,

82
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:21,460
Longshanks would have
to do the honours himself.

83
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,042
That may have been
what he had in mind all along.

84
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:32,049
Scotland...

85
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,636
My land.

86
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:40,559
The French will grovel
to anyone with strength.

87
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:45,991
But how will they believe our strength
when we cannot rule the whole of our island?

88
00:17:57,838 --> 00:18:01,005
- Where is my son?
- Your pardon, my Lord.

89
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:03,464
He asked me to come in his stead.

90
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:05,961
I sent for him and he sends you?

91
00:18:06,723 --> 00:18:08,799
Shall I leave, my Lord?

92
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,226
If he wants his queen to rule when I am gone,

93
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:17,526
then by all means stay and learn how. Please.

94
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:24,358
Nobles.

95
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:27,702
Nobles are the key to the door of Scotland.

96
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:31,489
Grant our nobles lands in the North.

97
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:37,588
Give their nobles estates here in England.
And make them too greedy to oppose us.

98
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:40,795
But, sir, our nobles
will be reluctant to uproot.

99
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:45,383
New lands mean new taxes and they're
already taxed for the war in France.

100
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:47,551
Are they?

101
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,638
Are they?

102
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:10,666
The trouble with Scotland

103
00:19:10,753 --> 00:19:12,663
is that it's full of Scots.

104
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:19,837
Perhaps the time has come

105
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,386
to reinstitute an old custom.

106
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:25,810
Grant them primae noctis.

107
00:19:28,523 --> 00:19:33,815
First night. When any common girl
inhabiting their lands is married,

108
00:19:33,904 --> 00:19:39,279
our nobles shall have sexual rights to her
on the night of her wedding.

109
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,157
If we can't get them out,

110
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,420
we'll breed them out.

111
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:52,335
That should fetch just the kind
of lords we want to Scotland.

112
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,502
Taxes or no taxes.

113
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,634
A most excellent idea, sire.

114
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:58,798
Is it?

115
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:07,851
Now, in Edinburgh were gathered
the council of Scottish nobles.

116
00:20:07,943 --> 00:20:12,190
Among these was Robert,
the 17th Earl of Bruce,

117
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:16,323
a leading contender
for the crown of Scotland.

118
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:25,661
I hear that Longshanks
has granted primae noctis.

119
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:28,958
Clearly meant to draw
more of his supporters here.

120
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:34,086
My father believes we must lull
Longshanks into our confidence

121
00:20:34,181 --> 00:20:37,217
by neither supporting his decree
nor opposing it.

122
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:41,224
- A wise plan.
- How is your father? He missed the council.

123
00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:44,315
His affairs in France keep him long overdue.

124
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:51,232
But he sends his greetings.

125
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:54,404
And he says that I speak
for all of the Bruces

126
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:56,572
and for Scotland.

127
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,600
- You've dropped your rock.
- A test of manhood.

128
00:23:13,902 --> 00:23:16,191
You win.

129
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:19,483
Call it a test of soldiery, then.

130
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:23,533
The English won't let us train with weapons,
so we use stones.

131
00:23:23,622 --> 00:23:27,406
The test of a soldier is not in his arm.
It's here.

132
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:29,790
No. It's here.

133
00:23:36,803 --> 00:23:38,879
Hamish?

134
00:23:51,945 --> 00:23:54,021
Here you go, son. Show him how.

135
00:23:54,114 --> 00:23:56,440
- Come on, Hamish.
- Come on, boy.

136
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,029
Come on.

137
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,295
That's a good throw.

138
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,428
Aye, it was.

139
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:21,642
I was wondering
if you could do that when it matters.

140
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,016
As it... as it matters in battle.

141
00:24:28,528 --> 00:24:30,854
Could you crush a man with that throw?

142
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:33,236
I could crush you... like a worm.

143
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:37,704
- You could?
- Aye.

144
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:41,999
Well, then, do it.
Like to see him crush me like a worm?

145
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:48,505
- Come and do it.
- You'll move.

146
00:24:48,592 --> 00:24:51,677
- I will not.
- Right.

147
00:24:51,763 --> 00:24:53,257
He'll move.

148
00:24:53,348 --> 00:24:55,257
Come on, Hamish.

149
00:24:56,685 --> 00:24:58,761
Come on there, boy.

150
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:07,894
Well done.

151
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:25,204
- A fine display.
- Are you all right?

152
00:25:26,135 --> 00:25:30,263
- You look a wee bit shaky.
- I should have remembered the rocks.

153
00:25:30,348 --> 00:25:31,379
Aye.

154
00:25:37,189 --> 00:25:39,229
Get up, you big heap of...

155
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,187
- It's good to see ye again.
- Aye, welcome home.

156
00:25:45,907 --> 00:25:49,323
- Look what you did to my head.
- You should have moved.

157
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:01,960
William, will you dance with me?

158
00:26:02,968 --> 00:26:05,044
Of course I will.

159
00:26:29,831 --> 00:26:32,952
I've come to claim the right
of primae noctis.

160
00:26:33,043 --> 00:26:39,332
As lord of these lands, I will bless this
marriage by taking the bride into my bed

161
00:26:39,426 --> 00:26:41,999
on the first night of her union.

162
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:43,506
By God you will not!

163
00:26:47,768 --> 00:26:49,845
It is my noble right.

164
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:54,613
- Good evening, sir.
- Ah, young Wallace.

165
00:28:55,704 --> 00:28:58,824
- A grand soft evening.
- Aye, it's that.

166
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:01,158
Might I have a word with your daughter?

167
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:05,913
What do you want to have a word about?

168
00:29:06,007 --> 00:29:07,170
Well...

169
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:10,842
Murron, would you like to ride with me
on this fine evening?

170
00:29:12,974 --> 00:29:16,094
In this? You're out of your mind.

171
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:20,480
It's good Scottish weather, madam.
The rain is falling almost straight down.

172
00:29:20,565 --> 00:29:23,187
- She cannae go with you.
- No?

173
00:29:23,277 --> 00:29:25,733
No. No the now, anyway.

174
00:29:25,821 --> 00:29:27,530
- No the now.
- No the now.

175
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:31,399
- We'll see ye later.
- The weather's fine. It's hardly raining.

176
00:29:31,494 --> 00:29:33,571
Did you no hear what I said?

177
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:36,157
Murron.

178
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:40,745
It's you she takes after.

179
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:13,826
- How did you know me after so long?
- I didn't.

180
00:30:14,877 --> 00:30:18,044
I saw you staring at me
and I didn't know who you were.

181
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,207
I'm sorry. I suppose I was.

182
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:25,882
Are you in the habit of riding off
with strangers?

183
00:30:25,972 --> 00:30:28,380
It was the best way to make you leave.

184
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:35,606
If I ever find the courage to ask ye again,
I'll warn you in writing first.

185
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:38,361
- It wouldn't help. I can't read.
- Can ye not?

186
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:40,604
No.

187
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:46,609
- That's something we shall have to remedy.
- You'll teach me to read?

188
00:30:46,704 --> 00:30:48,780
- Aye, if you like.
- Aye.

189
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,998
- In what language?
- You're showing off now.

190
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:57,296
- That's right. Are you impressed yet?
- No. Should I be?

191
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:09,434
Do that standing on your head,
and I'll be impressed.

192
00:31:09,688 --> 00:31:13,769
- My kilt'll fly up, but I'll try.
- You learnt no manners on your travels.

193
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,861
The French and the Romans
are far worse than I.

194
00:31:16,947 --> 00:31:20,067
- You went to Rome?
- Uncle took me on a pilgrimage.

195
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:22,235
What was it like?

196
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:28,992
What does that mean?

197
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:31,328
Beautiful.

198
00:31:33,882 --> 00:31:35,959
But I belong here.

199
00:32:08,588 --> 00:32:10,664
Murron. Come in now.

200
00:33:22,088 --> 00:33:26,549
Sir, I know it was strange of me
to invite Murron to ride last night, but...

201
00:33:26,634 --> 00:33:29,090
MacClannough's daughter is another matter.

202
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:33,592
- I've come to fetch you to a meeting.
- What kind of meeting?

203
00:33:33,684 --> 00:33:37,053
- The secret kind.
- Your meetings are a waste of time.

204
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:42,017
Your father was a fighter...

205
00:33:42,652 --> 00:33:44,729
...and a patriot.

206
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:48,233
I know who my father was.

207
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,577
I came home to raise crops
and, God willing, a family.

208
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:57,668
- If I can live in peace, I will.
- Go on.

209
00:33:57,753 --> 00:34:00,505
- You want to stay out of the troubles?
- Aye.

210
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:03,756
If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.

211
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:05,919
Until you prove it, the answer is no.

212
00:34:06,012 --> 00:34:08,682
- No.
- No, Wallace. No.

213
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:11,930
- Didn't I just prove it?
- No.

214
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:14,095
- No?
- No!

215
00:34:55,902 --> 00:34:58,856
Of course, running a farm is a lot of work.

216
00:34:58,947 --> 00:35:02,233
But that will all change when my sons arrive.

217
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,236
So, you've got children.

218
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:09,374
Well, not yet. But I was hoping
that you could help me with that.

219
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:10,989
So you want me to marry you, then?

220
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:13,624
Well, it's a bit sudden, but all right.

221
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:15,671
Is that what you call a proposal?

222
00:35:17,509 --> 00:35:20,297
I love you. Always have.

223
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:24,383
I want to marry you.

224
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:38,065
Is that a yes?

225
00:35:38,157 --> 00:35:40,234
- Aye, that's a yes.
- Yeah?

226
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:26,203
- We'd best hurry. He'll be waiting.
- Oh, wait.

227
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:28,371
Where are you going?

228
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:36,005
- What's that?
- You'll see.

229
00:36:55,203 --> 00:36:57,279
Father.

230
00:37:09,385 --> 00:37:11,508
I will love you my whole life.

231
00:37:12,973 --> 00:37:15,049
You and no other.

232
00:37:19,814 --> 00:37:22,056
And I you.

233
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,226
You and no other... for ever.

234
00:40:52,804 --> 00:40:55,342
When will I see ye again? Tonight?

235
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:57,674
- I can't.
- Why not?

236
00:40:57,768 --> 00:40:59,511
My dad's growing suspicious.

237
00:40:59,603 --> 00:41:02,390
Would that have anything to do with...

238
00:41:02,481 --> 00:41:04,557
When?

239
00:41:05,943 --> 00:41:07,521
When?

240
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:09,688
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

241
00:41:16,998 --> 00:41:19,074
Look lively, Sergeant.

242
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:32,547
What are you carrying, lassie?

243
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,807
- That looks heavy. Can we help you?
- That's fine.

244
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:37,970
I'm not going to steal it...

245
00:41:38,981 --> 00:41:42,231
Oh. You remind me
of my daughter back home.

246
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:57,834
Hello, lassie.

247
00:42:17,065 --> 00:42:19,521
Keep quiet, Smythe.

248
00:42:23,072 --> 00:42:24,401
You bitch.

249
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,327
You bitch.

250
00:42:41,676 --> 00:42:43,753
Are you all right?

251
00:42:47,683 --> 00:42:49,759
- Are you all right?
- Aye.

252
00:42:59,822 --> 00:43:01,898
- Can you ride?
- Aye.

253
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,866
Come back here, you bastard!

254
00:43:09,624 --> 00:43:12,376
Ring the alarm. Help!

255
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,709
Meet me at the grove. Ride!

256
00:43:15,798 --> 00:43:17,755
They're getting away.

257
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:02,758
All right, you bitch.

258
00:44:25,668 --> 00:44:27,745
Murron.

259
00:44:44,523 --> 00:44:49,435
All of you know full well
the great pains I've always taken

260
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:54,610
never to be too strict, too rigid,
with the application of our laws.

261
00:44:55,786 --> 00:44:57,862
And, as a consequence,

262
00:44:57,955 --> 00:45:01,075
have we not learned to live together

263
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:03,740
in relative peace and harmony?

264
00:45:03,836 --> 00:45:05,710
Huh?

265
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:15,257
And this... day's lawlessness
is how you repay my leniency.

266
00:45:24,401 --> 00:45:26,478
You leave me with little choice.

267
00:45:34,746 --> 00:45:36,905
An assault on the King's soldiers

268
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:41,292
is the same as an assault
on the King himself.

269
00:45:57,939 --> 00:45:59,766
Now,

270
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:02,693
let this scrapper come to me.

271
00:46:58,466 --> 00:47:00,126
There.

272
00:50:26,617 --> 00:50:29,190
Corporal. Some archers on the tower. Now!

273
00:50:39,715 --> 00:50:42,004
Hold still, Father.

274
00:50:42,093 --> 00:50:44,382
You idiot, boy.

275
00:52:08,356 --> 00:52:10,930
- Father, are you all right?
- Aye.

276
00:53:33,786 --> 00:53:35,446
MacCaulich.

277
00:53:50,638 --> 00:53:53,260
Wallace.

278
00:56:15,844 --> 00:56:17,920
What are you waiting for, boy?

279
00:56:19,014 --> 00:56:21,719
Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.

280
00:56:23,602 --> 00:56:27,185
Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.

281
00:56:27,273 --> 00:56:29,349
Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

282
00:56:29,442 --> 00:56:32,360
I know it seems like
a waste of good whisky. Indulge me.

283
00:56:36,325 --> 00:56:40,157
Hold him. Hold him. Hold him. Now,

284
00:56:40,246 --> 00:56:41,824
let him go.

285
00:56:46,294 --> 00:56:47,872
All right?

286
00:56:47,963 --> 00:56:50,715
That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

287
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,421
- There's somebody coming.
- Arm yourselves.

288
00:57:00,143 --> 00:57:02,220
There's somebody coming.

289
00:57:02,813 --> 00:57:06,348
MacGregors. From the next glen.

290
00:57:11,448 --> 00:57:13,690
We heard about what was happening.

291
00:57:13,784 --> 00:57:18,245
We don't want you amerdans
thinking you can have your fun without us.

292
00:57:19,832 --> 00:57:21,790
Go home.

293
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:23,953
Some of us are in this.

294
00:57:25,046 --> 00:57:28,879
I can't help that now.
But you can help yourselves.

295
00:57:28,968 --> 00:57:30,628
Go home.

296
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,800
We'll have no homes left
when the English garrison burns us out.

297
00:57:36,017 --> 00:57:39,802
- And they will.
- Aye.

298
00:57:41,148 --> 00:57:42,726
Welcome.

299
00:58:12,225 --> 00:58:14,301
Patrol returning, my Lord.

300
00:58:42,133 --> 00:58:43,842
So, what news?

301
00:58:55,482 --> 00:58:59,812
I have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark.
They will be returning now.

302
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,062
Were they dressed like this?

303
00:59:03,824 --> 00:59:06,031
Actually, it was more like 50.

304
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:08,696
Make it quick.

305
00:59:10,957 --> 00:59:13,034
Do you remember me?

306
00:59:14,169 --> 00:59:20,173
- I never did her any harm. It was my right.
- I'm here to claim the right of a husband!

307
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:29,552
I'm William Wallace.

308
00:59:31,189 --> 00:59:33,265
And the rest of you will be spared.

309
00:59:34,234 --> 00:59:36,772
Go back to England.

310
00:59:36,862 --> 00:59:41,857
And tell them there that Scotland's
daughters and her sons are yours no more.

311
00:59:43,995 --> 00:59:46,071
Tell them Scotland is free.

312
00:59:52,004 --> 00:59:53,035
Burn it.

313
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:31,458
The Scottish rebels
have routed one of my garrisons

314
01:00:32,174 --> 01:00:34,500
and murdered the noble Lord.

315
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:38,259
I heard.
This Wallace is a brigand, nothing more.

316
01:00:38,348 --> 01:00:41,799
And how would you deal with this... brigand?

317
01:00:41,893 --> 01:00:46,022
Like any common thief. Have the
local magistrate arrest and punish him.

318
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:51,729
Leave us.

319
01:01:01,707 --> 01:01:06,915
Wallace has already killed the magistrate
and taken control of the town.

320
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:09,377
Stand up.

321
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:11,210
Stand up!

322
01:01:12,219 --> 01:01:14,295
In the morning,

323
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:17,927
I depart for France to press our rights there.

324
01:01:18,017 --> 01:01:21,054
And I leave you here
to quell this little rebellion.

325
01:01:21,146 --> 01:01:24,064
Understood? Is it?

326
01:01:26,902 --> 01:01:29,310
One day you will be a king.

327
01:01:31,157 --> 01:01:33,233
At least try to act like one.

328
01:01:37,581 --> 01:01:39,657
Get away from me.

329
01:01:40,084 --> 01:01:42,540
Convene my military council.

330
01:02:23,508 --> 01:02:24,967
There.

331
01:02:27,345 --> 01:02:28,674
After them.

332
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:59,169
No point resisting.
You're outnumbered and trapped.

333
01:02:59,256 --> 01:03:02,626
Where are the rest of you? Where's Wallace?

334
01:03:14,899 --> 01:03:18,066
- Father.
- Ah, come in. Come in.

335
01:03:19,154 --> 01:03:21,230
A rebellion has begun.

336
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:32,245
- Under whom?
- A commoner... named William Wallace.

337
01:03:43,056 --> 01:03:45,381
You will embrace this rebellion.

338
01:03:45,475 --> 01:03:48,311
Support it from our lands in the North.

339
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,849
I will gain English favour by condemning it

340
01:03:52,942 --> 01:03:56,394
and ordering it opposed
from our lands in the South.

341
01:03:58,281 --> 01:04:00,986
Sit down. Stay awhile.

342
01:04:07,959 --> 01:04:10,035
This Wallace...

343
01:04:11,212 --> 01:04:15,424
He doesn't even have a knighthood.
But he fights with passion.

344
01:04:15,509 --> 01:04:17,549
And he inspires!

345
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:20,721
And you wish to charge off
and fight as he did?

346
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:25,428
- So would I.
- Well, maybe it's time.

347
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,806
It is time... to survive.

348
01:04:28,899 --> 01:04:31,936
You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

349
01:04:32,028 --> 01:04:37,901
The 16 before you passed you land and title
because they didn't charge in.

350
01:04:39,953 --> 01:04:43,239
- Call a meeting of the nobles.
- They do nothing but talk.

351
01:04:43,332 --> 01:04:48,291
Rightly so. They're as rich in English titles
and lands as they are in Scottish, as we are.

352
01:04:48,379 --> 01:04:51,796
You admire this man... this William Wallace.

353
01:04:51,883 --> 01:04:54,505
Uncompromising men are easier to admire.

354
01:04:54,595 --> 01:04:57,003
He has courage. So does a dog.

355
01:04:57,097 --> 01:05:01,725
But it is exactly the ability to compromise
that makes a man noble.

356
01:05:02,604 --> 01:05:04,680
And understand this:

357
01:05:04,773 --> 01:05:09,151
Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless king
ever to sit on the throne of England.

358
01:05:09,236 --> 01:05:11,525
And none of us

359
01:05:11,614 --> 01:05:14,734
and nothing of Scotland will remain

360
01:05:14,826 --> 01:05:16,902
unless we are as ruthless.

361
01:05:18,288 --> 01:05:20,364
Give ear to our nobles.

362
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:23,660
Knowing their minds

363
01:05:23,752 --> 01:05:25,829
is the key to the throne.

364
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:44,891
Wait. Look.

365
01:05:45,819 --> 01:05:47,895
This is out and this is left.

366
01:05:48,489 --> 01:05:50,565
Carry on.

367
01:07:33,857 --> 01:07:38,021
You know, eventually,
Longshanks will send in his northern army.

368
01:07:38,112 --> 01:07:42,157
Heavy cavalry. Armoured horse.
Shake the very ground.

369
01:07:44,369 --> 01:07:48,414
- He'll ride right over us.
- Uncle Argyle used to talk about it.

370
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:51,958
How no army had ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.

371
01:07:52,045 --> 01:07:55,544
- So what do we do?
- Hit. Run. Hide. The Highland way.

372
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:05,973
Or make spears.

373
01:08:06,811 --> 01:08:09,931
Hundreds of 'em.
Long spears. Twice as long as a man.

374
01:08:11,024 --> 01:08:12,732
- That long?
- Aye.

375
01:08:14,194 --> 01:08:16,271
Some men are longer than others.

376
01:08:16,364 --> 01:08:19,614
Your mother been telling you
stories about me again?

377
01:08:21,369 --> 01:08:23,077
Volunteers coming in.

378
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:30,499
William Wallace.
We've come to fight and to die for you.

379
01:08:30,588 --> 01:08:32,664
Stand up, man. I'm not the Pope.

380
01:08:33,466 --> 01:08:35,708
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

381
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:39,424
- I brought you this...
- We checked them for arms.

382
01:08:40,808 --> 01:08:42,931
I brought you this.

383
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:45,344
- My wife made it for you.
- Thank you.

384
01:08:50,277 --> 01:08:52,946
Him! That can't be William Wallace.

385
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:55,106
I'm prettier than this man.

386
01:08:58,786 --> 01:09:01,029
All right, Father. I'll ask him.

387
01:09:04,751 --> 01:09:06,910
If I risk my neck for you,

388
01:09:07,004 --> 01:09:09,080
will I get to kill Englishmen?

389
01:09:09,173 --> 01:09:12,625
Is your father a ghost
or do you converse with the Almighty?

390
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,922
To find his equal,
an Irishman is forced to talk to God.

391
01:09:16,014 --> 01:09:17,473
Yes, Father.

392
01:09:17,558 --> 01:09:21,057
The Almighty says,
"Just answer the fucking question!"

393
01:09:21,145 --> 01:09:23,185
- Mind your tongue.
- Insane Irish!

394
01:09:27,777 --> 01:09:31,478
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.

395
01:09:31,573 --> 01:09:33,566
That's my friend, Irishman.

396
01:09:33,659 --> 01:09:38,322
And the answer to your question is yes.
Fight for me, you get to kill the English.

397
01:09:39,165 --> 01:09:40,624
Excellent.

398
01:09:41,293 --> 01:09:43,369
Stephen is my name.

399
01:09:43,462 --> 01:09:45,834
I'm the most wanted man on my island.

400
01:09:45,923 --> 01:09:48,379
Except I'm not on my island, of course.

401
01:09:48,467 --> 01:09:50,923
- More's the pity.
- Your island?

402
01:09:51,012 --> 01:09:54,049
- You mean Ireland?
- Yeah. It's mine.

403
01:09:58,937 --> 01:10:01,014
You're a madman.

404
01:10:07,823 --> 01:10:09,862
I've come to the right place, then.

405
01:11:30,457 --> 01:11:33,874
Sure, didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?

406
01:11:35,505 --> 01:11:37,581
I didn't like him anyway.

407
01:11:39,843 --> 01:11:41,966
He wasn't right in the head.

408
01:11:55,152 --> 01:11:57,987
William. It's our runners.

409
01:12:09,209 --> 01:12:12,910
The English... are advancing
an army towards Stirling.

410
01:12:13,005 --> 01:12:17,335
- Do the nobles rally?
- Robert the Bruce and others will not fight.

411
01:12:17,427 --> 01:12:21,010
But word has spread. The Highlanders
are coming down on their own.

412
01:12:21,098 --> 01:12:24,348
Aye... In droves of hundreds...
and thousands!

413
01:12:24,435 --> 01:12:26,558
Are you ready for a war?

414
01:12:42,622 --> 01:12:45,623
- What news?
- We're outnumbered, at least three to one.

415
01:12:45,709 --> 01:12:48,034
- How many horse, then?
- 300, maybe more.

416
01:12:48,128 --> 01:12:51,082
- 300 heavy horse!
- We must try to negotiate.

417
01:12:51,173 --> 01:12:54,922
Who was in command?
Did he have a scarlet chevron?

418
01:12:55,011 --> 01:12:57,502
- Aye, he did.
- That'll be Cheltham.

419
01:12:57,597 --> 01:12:59,673
We could still negotiate...

420
01:13:03,687 --> 01:13:05,811
What are they talking about?

421
01:13:05,898 --> 01:13:08,568
I cannae hear, but it doesnae look good.

422
01:13:08,651 --> 01:13:10,728
The nobles will negotiate.

423
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:14,024
They do a deal... and we go home.

424
01:13:14,116 --> 01:13:16,689
If not... we charge.

425
01:13:16,785 --> 01:13:19,537
300 heavy horse. We've no chance.

426
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:19,887
So many.

427
01:14:24,779 --> 01:14:28,113
I didn't come here to fight
so they could own more lands.

428
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:30,275
Then I'd have to work for them.

429
01:14:30,368 --> 01:14:32,445
Nor me.

430
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:36,580
All right, lads.
I'm not dying for these bastards.

431
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,666
Let's go home.

432
01:14:56,523 --> 01:14:58,812
Stop, men!

433
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:02,946
Do not flee. Wait until we've negotiated.

434
01:15:56,215 --> 01:15:59,501
- William Wallace!
- Can't be. Not tall enough.

435
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:25,030
The Almighty says this is a fashionable fight.
It's drawn the finest people.

436
01:16:25,123 --> 01:16:30,544
- Where is thy salute?
- For coming to this battlefield, I thank you.

437
01:16:30,629 --> 01:16:33,713
This is our army. To join it, you give homage.

438
01:16:33,799 --> 01:16:36,207
I give homage to Scotland.

439
01:16:36,302 --> 01:16:38,591
And if this is your army,

440
01:16:39,973 --> 01:16:41,550
why does it go?

441
01:16:41,641 --> 01:16:43,930
We didn't come here to fight for them.

442
01:16:47,982 --> 01:16:50,438
Home. The English are too many.

443
01:16:59,661 --> 01:17:04,039
Sons of Scotland! I am William Wallace!

444
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:07,790
- William Wallace is seven feet tall.
- Yes, I've heard.

445
01:17:08,505 --> 01:17:10,581
He kills men by the hundred.

446
01:17:10,674 --> 01:17:15,004
And if he were here, he'd consume
the English with fireballs from his eyes

447
01:17:15,096 --> 01:17:17,172
and lightning from his arse.

448
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,345
I am William Wallace!

449
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:29,353
And I see a whole army of my countrymen

450
01:17:29,445 --> 01:17:31,734
here in defiance of tyranny.

451
01:17:35,076 --> 01:17:37,650
You've come to fight as free men

452
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:41,866
and free men you are!

453
01:17:44,754 --> 01:17:47,245
What will you do without freedom?

454
01:17:49,384 --> 01:17:51,460
Will you fight?

455
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:56,930
Against that? No.

456
01:17:57,018 --> 01:17:59,141
We will run, and we will live.

457
01:18:00,188 --> 01:18:02,726
Aye. Fight and you may die.

458
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:05,727
Run, and you'll live.

459
01:18:06,737 --> 01:18:09,489
At least a while.

460
01:18:11,659 --> 01:18:14,910
And dying in your beds,
many years from now,

461
01:18:16,248 --> 01:18:18,573
would you be willing to trade

462
01:18:18,667 --> 01:18:21,538
all the days from this day to that

463
01:18:21,629 --> 01:18:24,299
for one chance, just one chance,

464
01:18:24,382 --> 01:18:27,217
to come back here and tell our enemies

465
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:29,591
that they may take our lives

466
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:33,843
but they'll never take our freedom!

467
01:19:00,923 --> 01:19:04,127
They seem quite optimistic.
Maybe they do want to fight.

468
01:19:04,218 --> 01:19:07,136
Confrontation might be
a foregone conclusion.

469
01:19:08,473 --> 01:19:11,391
Nonetheless, we should
deliver the King's terms.

470
01:19:11,477 --> 01:19:14,597
The King's terms?
They'll never live up to them.

471
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:16,516
My Lord, I think...

472
01:19:16,607 --> 01:19:18,731
All right. Offer them the terms.

473
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:26,284
- They're coming out. Should we go to them?
- Let me do the talking. Agreed?

474
01:19:26,368 --> 01:19:27,614
Aye.

475
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,577
Fine speech.

476
01:19:35,379 --> 01:19:37,455
Now what do we do?

477
01:19:38,674 --> 01:19:40,750
Just be yourselves.

478
01:19:41,302 --> 01:19:45,003
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to pick a fight.

479
01:19:51,313 --> 01:19:54,647
Well, we didn't get dressed up for nothing.

480
01:19:57,362 --> 01:19:59,401
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

481
01:20:04,411 --> 01:20:06,488
Here are the King's terms.

482
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:10,080
Lead this army off the field

483
01:20:14,131 --> 01:20:16,966
and he will give you each estates in Yorkshire

484
01:20:18,135 --> 01:20:22,085
including hereditary title,
from which you will pay...

485
01:20:23,474 --> 01:20:26,262
- From which you will pay...
- I have an offer for ye.

486
01:20:26,353 --> 01:20:29,354
Cheltham, this is William Wallace.

487
01:20:31,066 --> 01:20:33,143
From which you will pay the King...

488
01:20:33,235 --> 01:20:36,521
- I said I have an offer.
- You disrespect a banner of truce.

489
01:20:36,614 --> 01:20:38,524
From his King? Absolutely.

490
01:20:39,951 --> 01:20:45,622
Here are Scotland's terms. Lower your flags
and march straight back to England.

491
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:50,951
At every home you pass, beg forgiveness
for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.

492
01:20:52,048 --> 01:20:54,290
Do that, and your men shall live.

493
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:58,297
Do it not and every one of you will die today.

494
01:21:05,188 --> 01:21:08,889
You are outmatched.
You have no heavy cavalry.

495
01:21:08,984 --> 01:21:11,772
In two centuries, no army has won without...

496
01:21:11,862 --> 01:21:13,855
I'm not finished!

497
01:21:15,491 --> 01:21:17,568
Before we let you leave

498
01:21:18,203 --> 01:21:22,699
your commander must cross that field,
present himself before this army,

499
01:21:23,042 --> 01:21:26,245
put his head between his legs
and kiss his own arse.

500
01:21:37,766 --> 01:21:40,174
That was less cordial than he was used to.

501
01:21:40,269 --> 01:21:43,603
You be ready and do exactly as I say.
On my signal

502
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:46,775
ride round behind our position,
and flank them.

503
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:51,321
- We must not divide our forces.
- Do it... and let the English see you do it.

504
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:54,651
They'll think we run away?

505
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:57,366
Take out their archers and meet in the middle.

506
01:21:57,914 --> 01:21:59,990
Right. Come on.

507
01:22:23,902 --> 01:22:27,686
Insolent bastard.
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate!

508
01:22:28,615 --> 01:22:30,110
Archers.

509
01:22:38,585 --> 01:22:41,789
Archers forward.

510
01:23:38,444 --> 01:23:39,773
You bastards.

511
01:24:14,902 --> 01:24:16,100
Loose.

512
01:24:36,134 --> 01:24:40,631
The Lord tells me He can get me out of
this mess but He's pretty sure you're fucked.

513
01:25:01,746 --> 01:25:03,704
Ready... Loose.

514
01:25:21,894 --> 01:25:23,388
Ride.

515
01:25:27,442 --> 01:25:30,112
See? Every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

516
01:25:30,195 --> 01:25:34,525
Our cavalry will ride them down like grass.
Send the horse.

517
01:25:35,367 --> 01:25:37,028
Full attack.

518
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:53,328
Steady...

519
01:26:54,582 --> 01:26:55,910
Hold.

520
01:26:58,002 --> 01:26:59,545
Hold.

521
01:27:04,301 --> 01:27:05,380
Hold.

522
01:27:09,974 --> 01:27:11,766
Hold.

523
01:27:23,489 --> 01:27:25,778
Now!

524
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:13,749
