1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,676
Kobe, Japan
1945

2
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:34,526
Tombstone  Of  The  Fireflies

3
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,166
Seita, my geta...

4
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:09,792
We'll get new ones.

5
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,874
Where's Mommy?

6
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,408
She's waiting in the bomb shelter.

7
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,004
Seita!

8
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,933
This is Aya-chan.

9
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,550
Isn't this Taro?

10
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,018
Mommy wasn't here.

11
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,556
Let's go, she's waiting for us.

12
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:18,123
How could they drop a bomb
on the shelter?

13
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,807
Oh, I forgot.

14
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,751
Dosn't this belong to your mother?

15
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,088
Yes.

16
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,686
Take it for now, okay?

17
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,094
Your mother's in here.

18
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,328
Don't just stand there!

19
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,065
Seita...

20
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,716
Hey, Seita?

21
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,244
Setsuko!

22
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,686
What's wrong, Setsuko?

23
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,355
Setsuko?

24
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,830
What happened?

25
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:48,294
I swallowed it.

26
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,839
Does your tummy ache?

27
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,382
It'll come out soon.

28
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,851
Seita...

29
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,918
It's his fault.

30
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,521
Don't be cranky.

31
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,474
Seita, can you do that
thing that Setsuko loves...?

32
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:40,719
No.

33
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,286
Come on.

34
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,112
Please.

35
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,121
No.

36
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,022
Do it for her.
And for me too.

37
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,354
No.

38
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,660
You've caught a big one!

39
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,271
Seita.

40
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,479
Seita!

41
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,215
I'll take Mother to the hospital.

42
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,276
It's too late.

43
00:09:56,662 --> 00:10:00,598
Seita, run around again, please!

44
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,925
Seita, you've really improved.

45
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,059
Thank you, Father.

46
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:08,198
But he shouldn't push himself
so hard...

47
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,398
Why's that?

48
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,344
Because he's born weak like me...

49
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,535
There's been no sign of asthma.

50
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,679
Mother, don't worry so much.

51
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,047
But you had an attack
the other night.

52
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,278
Seita is over his asthma now.

53
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,684
But...

54
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,551
Mother, I don't have asthma
anymore.

55
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:34,228
I've improved but Mother's heart
condition hasn't.

56
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,263
Medicine doesn't seem to help.

57
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,597
I'll rub your back to
ease your discomfort.

58
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,801
Seita...

59
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,277
No need to worry, he'll
make a fine man one day.

60
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,048
Setsuko, what's wrong?

61
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:16,738
Wait until your father and brother
finish eating.

62
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,840
Look at her, Dear.

63
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,014
Would you like to hold her?

64
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,554
Such a tiny, little hand...

65
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,336
Ah... fireflies.

66
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:09,020
What a big baby I have here!

67
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,234
Seita.

68
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:29,377
Is this my house?

69
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:34,509
Yes, it was our house.

70
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,996
We found it!

71
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:08,652
It's a glorious honor
To fight for the Emperor

72
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:15,153
The roaring cheers of
The whole o Japan

73
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,232
Where's Mommy?

74
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:23,861
In the hospital.

75
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,469
I want to see her.

76
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,667
Let's go visit our aunt
in Nishinomiya.

77
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,073
Mommy will come soon.

78
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:46,449
Wherever I go
In the war of justice

79
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,125
No enemy will intefere
With my heroic advances

80
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,925
Go, strong one!

81
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:12,912
Ma'am, you have nothing at all
to worry about.

82
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:17,179
Dig deeper on the left
there, will you?

83
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,650
Right there.

84
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:28,431
Somebody, move these things
out of way, quickly!

85
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,971
Don't worry!

86
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,618
You over there!

87
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:00,829
You're not from Tateishi Junior High,
are you?

88
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,496
I'm from Kobe 1st Junior High.

89
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:04,761
Where are you from?

90
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,434
Mikage.

91
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,574
I heard there was a
big air-raid there.

92
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,643
Did you lose your house?

93
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,704
I'm visiting my relative here.

94
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,444
In this area?

95
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,474
In the town of Shukugawa.

96
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,916
It's very close.

97
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,252
You play kendo?

98
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:27,656
Yes, sir.

99
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:33,123
After you settle in, come to the
school for a match.

100
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,489
I'm Tateishi's schoolmaster.

101
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,124
Schoolmaster?

102
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,664
Don't I look like one?

103
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,606
Maybe I should grow a mustache!

104
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,125
Hello?

105
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,731
Hello! Anybody home?

106
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,998
Yes, I'm in here!

107
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,133
Who can it be...
Just when I'm busy.

108
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,013
Yes, yes. Who is it?

109
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,148
What's wrong with you?
I didn't tell you to come in!

110
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,352
The gate was open...

111
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,149
That doesn't mean you can come in.

112
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,817
Didn't your parents teach you
any manners? What is it?

113
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,187
My mother sent some things to you
in the event...

114
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,766
Are you Seita from Mikage?

115
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,698
Your father's the Navy Captain?

116
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:51,567
I know you! I remember you.

117
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,510
Is that your sister?

118
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:59,148
I think I saw her once when
she was a baby.

119
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,683
It's Setsuko.

120
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,453
That's right, Setsuko!

121
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,151
We lost our house in the air-raid.

122
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,361
And your father?

123
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,529
He's on a Navy cruiser,
serving the country.

124
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,098
And your mother?

125
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,562
In the hospital.

126
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,105
And...?

127
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,570
Did you get the package?

128
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,973
A package?
I don't know anything about it...

129
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,578
other told us to visit you
in case of an emergency.

130
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:38,379
You're still kids
and you have no place to live.

131
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,981
I commiserate with you.
Do you know commiserate?

132
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,422
Yes, I do.

133
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,656
I'm a widow now...

134
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,359
My husband died in combat
half a year ago.

135
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,698
But I'm not alone.

136
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:59,368
I have a son and a daughter.
They're out working now.

137
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:04,714
It's a small house.
There's no room for you to stay.

138
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:09,514
Sorry. It's just impossible.
Take care now.

139
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,581
Please give me the package then...

140
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:17,261
Stop going on about the package!
I don't know anything about it.

141
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,264
Can we go, Seita?

142
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,265
That's right, off you go.

143
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,200
Seita.

144
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,349
Wait a minute.
What do you have in there?

145
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,919
Look at those delicacies!

146
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:56,432
What luxury a navy officer's
family enjoys!

147
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:01,229
Kindness begets kindness...
Do you know that?

148
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:02,903
Yes, I do.

149
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:10,679
Setsuko, you are so fair!
You're just like a doll.

150
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,504
Good work, Seita.

151
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,838
You can stay in this room.

152
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,904
Thank you very much.

153
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,240
You're so polite.
You've been well brought up.

154
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,679
That's an organ.

155
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:53,451
Know how to play?
Play it any time you want.

156
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,255
And Seita, let me tell you
something...

157
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:03,865
We are distant relatives with
just a slight connection.

158
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:08,597
There's really no reason why
I should take care of you.

159
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:12,401
But I hate to be uncharitable.

160
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,471
Do you know uncharitable?

161
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,441
No, ma'am.

162
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:22,349
Well anyway, I'm taking you in
so I expect you to share too.

163
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,241
What're you doing, Mom?

164
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,542
You startled me!
Hi, son.

165
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,740
I'm hungry.

166
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,477
Is that all you can say?

167
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:59,647
How about helping me clean up
this messy cupboard?

168
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,486
I have to try to get this in.

169
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:05,687
That's the Navy family's package.
Keep it in the hallway.

170
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,558
I can't leave it there.

171
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,495
More importantly, what are those
kids doing here?

172
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,429
They're distant relatives
from Mikage...

173
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,337
You mean, the Navy family?

174
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,909
Shut up! They'll hear you.

175
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:28,676
Those who've lost homes in the war
are entitled to tin rations.

176
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,653
I want to eat tinned beef.

177
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,483
Mom would do anything for food...

178
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,989
Quiet! How ill mannered you are!

179
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,670
I'm done, thank you.

180
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:57,412
You know your manners, Setsuko.
Are you full?

181
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,411
Eat up or you won't become
a big girl.

182
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,894
Girls that age are cute!
You were once cute like that.

183
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,296
Really?

184
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,735
I'm done, thank you.

185
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,674
Can I have a word with you?

186
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,918
Your mother's dead?

187
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,457
I have her bones in here.

188
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,131
You're lucky you have her bones.

189
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:55,270
I don't even know where
my husband died...

190
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:01,943
I have to ask you a favor.
Don't tell Setsuko about Mother.

191
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,078
She believes that Mom's
in the hospital.

192
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:11,544
All right. I'm well known for
my discretion.

193
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,049
Seita...

194
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,659
Seita?

195
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,195
Can't you sleep?

196
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,604
Did you have a dream?

197
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:05,739
I'm scared...

198
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:12,042
What's all the noise?
And at this time of night too...

199
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,312
I'm sorry.

200
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,113
I'll be the one who's blamed for
the noise.

201
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,125
Seita.

202
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:27,660
I want Mommy. I want to see her.

203
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,667
Get snappy and move it!

204
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:44,079
Pour it properly or it won't
do any good.

205
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:49,818
Put your soul in it and pour
as if you're attacking the enemy!

206
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:53,355
We'll keep doing it till
you get it right.

207
00:29:53,558 --> 00:30:00,157
Seita, don't just stand there.
You're in the neighbors group now.

208
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:06,429
This is a distant relative of mine.
Oh, the poor boy...

209
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:12,899
Their house burnt down while his dad,
a Navy Captain was away.

210
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,179
His mother died too...

211
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:21,551
He escaped with his little sister
and came to us.

212
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,654
Aunt, don't talk about mother...

213
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:31,123
I have two children to take care
but how could I turn them away?

214
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:36,999
Kids eat a lot so it's difficult
to provide for them.

215
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,863
As for me, I don't mind if I eat
twice or only once a day.

216
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,736
As long as the kids
have enough to eat...

217
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,203
Atta Lady!

218
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,212
Most of us can only afford to
take care of ourselves.

219
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:54,341
How incredible of you to take care
of somebody else's kids!

220
00:30:54,886 --> 00:31:00,415
Oh, I'm just doing
what seems right.

221
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:01,684
Hello.

222
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,241
Everyone, let's do it again.

223
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:30,477
There's a variety of incendiary bombs.

224
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,714
Electrons have sparks flying out
of them.

225
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,619
So cover yourself with
a wet straw mat to...

226
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:37,955
Excuse me, Sir...

227
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:42,055
If you want to know anything
about incendiary bombs, ask me.

228
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,734
There's no time to put out fires
in a raid, you should just run.

229
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:50,663
Don't be foolish!
You're not supposed to run.

230
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,571
Houses are the foundation
of the nation.

231
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:57,477
You extinguish the fire so it doesn't
spread to other houses, you fool!

232
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,211
Come on, let's go!

233
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:14,297
Why did you have to talk
back to the Leader?

234
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:18,293
I felt so ashamed that I
wanted to hide.

235
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:27,974
The schoolmaster.

236
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,874
I can offer you nothing but tea.

237
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:37,112
That's fine. I appreciate it.

238
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:42,322
What was it that you came to
talk about?

239
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,391
It's about Seita.

240
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,660
Did the boy do something wrong?

241
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,427
Not at all.
I came across him the other day

242
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,868
and he told me that he lost
his house in an air-raid.

243
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,540
When I heard about him
moving into this town

244
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,410
I somehow thought of him as being
my responsibility too.

245
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:09,544
Did he mention to you how long
he was planning to stay?

246
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,882
No, he didn't.

247
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:17,352
Do you intend to continue
taking care of them...?

248
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,027
Oh, I think so...

249
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,742
Seita, I'm scared.

250
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:22,019
Seita, don't scare Setsuko.

251
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,190
Seita, do you like to sing?

252
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,596
I love songs.

253
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,475
I love songs too.

254
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:44,508
But I'm not allowed to make a
noise at home, so I can't sing.

255
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:51,754
The foal's mane
Is wet with morning dew

256
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:56,357
Both my hands get wet
When I stroke it

257
00:34:56,627 --> 00:35:01,428
It neighs back to me
When I call its name

258
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:10,664
Shall we run up
The hill path?

259
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:15,311
Giddyup, Whoa
Going up the hill

260
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:20,016
I raised you from
A foal in the hay

261
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:24,212
Now you're a horse
With shiny fur

262
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:29,188
Don't get a stomachache
Don't catch a cold

263
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,560
Aunt...

264
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,287
Where's your brother?

265
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,828
He's pumping water.

266
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,358
What are you doing?

267
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,900
I'm tidying up because it's so messy.

268
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,701
That's Mommy's.

269
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,339
Such an important thing shouldn't
just be left here.

270
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,239
Some bad person might steal it.

271
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:38,352
Setsuko, do you know why
your mommy's bag is here?

272
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:42,024
Setsuko.

273
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:46,728
Do you want me to tell you where
your mommy's gone?

274
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,889
Sorry.

275
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,958
Where do you think you're going?

276
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,533
Come up here.

277
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:24,399
Then I'll help you with that.

278
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:31,447
"War hero's house"

279
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,683
Come in.

280
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:45,018
You a junior high student?
Where from?

281
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,958
Mikage.

282
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:52,129
Wasn't there an air-raid there?
Is your family okay?

283
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,103
Did they die?

284
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:03,445
Father's on a Navy cruiser,
serving the country.

285
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:08,042
Navy. Will you join the Navy
like your dad?

286
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,718
I don't know.

287
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,449
Why not?

288
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:14,322
I have asthma.

289
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:19,761
That's good. You can serve the
nation right here, like me.

290
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,256
I'm leaving.

291
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,459
Don't get upset.

292
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,408
Beanbags. Take all you want.

293
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,483
You can cook the beans inside
when you're hungry.

294
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,348
For my sister...

295
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:50,887
What are you doing here?

296
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:52,820
Me?

297
00:38:54,465 --> 00:39:01,064
I suffer from bad asthma
just like you.

298
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:02,528
It's not true!

299
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,937
I'm lying.

300
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:08,870
Do you...

301
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,381
Do you want to end up like this?

302
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,890
It's her husband.

303
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:28,861
He died when he was 24...
What a waste of a young life.

304
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,475
What's your name?

305
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,468
Seita.

306
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:48,884
Seita, get down and keep still.

307
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:50,750
Cover up like this.

308
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:56,487
Let the bad weather pass
over your head.

309
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:01,497
Look up when you think
the storm's gone.

310
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,366
There may be a blue sky
with no clouds.

311
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,439
But just when you thought
it was sunny

312
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:13,504
rain might come,
and a storm and lightening.

313
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,443
Hide under the blanket again.

314
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:20,375
No! I won't just hide quietly
under a blanket.

315
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,719
Seita, you're in no hurry.

316
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,780
Your turn will come anyway.

317
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:28,517
My turn?

318
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:32,590
Did you see that woman
run out of here?

319
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,930
We had a fight.

320
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:39,191
It was over something
embarrassingly trivial.

321
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:45,334
You get two people in a room,
they'll end up arguing.

322
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,878
That's what humans are like.

323
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:54,677
We end up killing each other.
It's always been like that.

324
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,879
Since the day that humans
were first on Earth.

325
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:05,822
It'll never change.
We'll keep on killing each other.

326
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,159
Wherever we are.

327
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:11,224
One day, it'll be your turn.

328
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,636
What will you do?

329
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:21,439
I'm going to get down like this
and hide like a mole.

330
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,705
You coward!

331
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,110
It's the best way.

332
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:31,116
Don't get upset, Seita.

333
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:35,525
Lucky you have asthma.
You can lay low like me.

334
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:41,721
No! I'd never do such a thing!

335
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,861
That's it, Seita.
That's just the way it is.

336
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:51,535
You have asthma.
Go home and lie down.

337
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:55,601
Take care of your sister for
the rest of your life.

338
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,875
That's the way to go.

339
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,074
No, I won't!

340
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:04,546
I'm going to go to war!

341
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,579
Supper.

342
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,245
It's suppertime.
What are you doing?

343
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,349
Supper, Setsuko.

344
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,855
Aren't you going to eat?

345
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:48,796
Go and eat.

346
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,257
I don't want to.

347
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,601
Go and eat.

348
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:06,608
Seita, if you don't come and eat,
I'll take yours off the table.

349
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,549
That's okay.

350
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:14,355
Did you go and visit
the university student?

351
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:17,420
You shouldn't talk to that man.

352
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:24,493
First you talk back to the Leader...
It's so embarrassing!

353
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:29,770
Behave more like the son of
an lmperial Navy Captain!

354
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:54,227
- It will get worse if you scratch.
- It's itchy.

355
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:55,960
Just don't scratch.

356
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,698
Someone's sleeping...

357
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:10,174
Turn this way.

358
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,854
Mommy.

359
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:36,461
Let's go back.

360
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,821
Mother.

361
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,762
Mother, what's wrong?

362
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,038
It's a letter from your father.

363
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:14,442
A letter? But Dad died
half a year ago...

364
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,376
It was written
before he died.

365
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:30,786
"I trust that you all
are doing well."

366
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:36,865
"As for me, there's no need
to worry as I'm quite healthy..."

367
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,865
It's so hard...

368
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,931
It really gets me down.

369
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:53,215
The foal's mane
Is wet with morning dew

370
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:58,387
Both my hands get wet
When I stroke it

371
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:02,751
It neighs back to me
When I call its name

372
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:05,157
Stop it, stop that right now!

373
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:08,221
Who said that you could play that?

374
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:12,829
If you don't like it here,
why don't you get out now!

375
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,232
Don't cry.

376
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:24,242
I want to go home. I don't want
to stay here anymore.

377
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,583
Our house burned down.

378
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:39,952
"Schoolmaster's Office"

379
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:56,436
You're courageous to challenge me,
young man. I accept it.

380
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,373
Are you very good, sir?

381
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,776
Don't worry, I'm only so-so.

382
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:07,687
Tell me if you need anything.

383
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,520
Thank you, schoolmaster.

384
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:19,533
They lost their house just like you.

385
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,700
It's your turn, Seita.

386
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,641
I can't play.

387
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:10,706
You don't have to play the piano.

388
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:11,973
How about a song?

389
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,275
Seita, do that one, please.

390
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,444
Be quiet!

391
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:20,454
What's that?

392
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,917
You do it well.

393
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,456
What's he good at, Setsuko?

394
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,790
Setsuko, don't answer.

395
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:33,962
We have to go.

396
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,602
Wait, it's still early...

397
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:57,891
This kimono is too good for me.

398
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:01,188
Come on, just try it on and see.

399
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:04,094
It looks great on you.

400
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,402
That's Mother's!

401
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:19,208
No! As I told you,
I bought it years ago.

402
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,350
It's Mother's. I know it.

403
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:26,821
Kids can't recognize different
kimono patterns.

404
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,321
Give it back to me.

405
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,049
Don't be silly!

406
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:43,171
It is true that your mother asked me
to take care of you.

407
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:48,300
I received the package she sent me
but there wasn't much in it.

408
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:51,913
I've been making the most of
what she sent

409
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:55,950
so that you wouldn't have
an empty stomach.

410
00:50:56,086 --> 00:51:00,523
It's all been for you.
Don't you see what I've been doing?

411
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,290
Give it back to me!

412
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:08,726
Right then!

413
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,459
From now on, I won't take care of
you anymore.

414
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:17,767
Does that suit you? Can you cook
for yourselves?

415
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:22,745
Just give me rice and we'll
look after ourselves.

416
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:24,947
I see.

417
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:28,215
Just as you say,
if that's what you want.

418
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,201
Does it cook rice well?

419
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,273
Cooking outside looks like a lot
of fun.

420
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,612
Did you have an argument with Mom?

421
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,482
Supper.

422
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:03,218
Come and eat.

423
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,889
I've made a delicious supper.

424
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:25,769
Is it done yet, Seita?

425
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,442
Just a minute.

426
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:45,460
Here, it's done.

427
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,194
It's done!

428
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:56,197
It's soggy...

429
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,275
Don't eat if you don't want to.

430
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,945
Is it yummy?

431
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,720
Seita, I can't sleep.

432
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,793
Shut up and sleep.

433
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:26,864
I said I can't.

434
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:28,195
Keep trying.

435
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:33,601
Be quiet.

436
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:40,409
What's all the noise?
Seita, make her be quiet.

437
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,233
Setsuko, look. Fireflies.

438
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:30,555
Setsuko. Haven't you had your
breakfast yet?

439
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:35,962
You can sit down here.
I'm on my way out now.

440
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,575
I'm done. See you later.

441
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,900
Me, too. Off I go.

442
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,273
Have a nice day.

443
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:49,816
They've gone to work for
the country.

444
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,817
Nobody can afford to sit around
doing nothing all day.

445
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,222
Aunt.

446
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:02,993
Can I sit down?

447
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,259
Of course you can, but I won't
serve you any food.

448
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:13,901
Setsuko.

449
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:17,905
Come on, breakfast is ready.

450
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:25,244
Ooh! What's for breakfast?
I wish I could have a taste!

451
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:31,286
The junior high school is on fire.

452
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:36,088
Look! The fire's getting bigger.

453
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:39,158
Schoolmaster, the school!

454
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,054
The schoolmaster ran away?

455
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:09,529
The neighbors' leader was the one
who found they'd disappeared.

456
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:11,432
The whole family?

457
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:14,036
Because the Emperor's photo
got burned.

458
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:15,935
How did it start?

459
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:19,940
Well, you know people were
staying at the school

460
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,703
who'd lost their homes.

461
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:25,713
Did they cause the fire?

462
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:29,043
Maybe they left a fire smoldering...

463
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,134
Seita.

464
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:27,304
What's the big panic?

465
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:30,804
The schoolmaster is dead!
And his family...

466
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:34,315
Just hide under a blanket.

467
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:06,879
"No Entry"

468
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:59,994
Hey, old man
Where are you going?

469
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:08,471
With that bamboo basket
Tied to your waist

470
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:15,875
I'm just going to the creek
To catch some loaches...

471
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:34,963
The foal's mane
Is wet with morning dew

472
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:39,265
Both my hands get wet
When I stroke it

473
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:44,869
It neighs back to me
When I call its name

474
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:49,380
Shall we run up

475
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:54,184
the hill path?

476
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:58,791
Giddyup, Whoa
Going up the hill

477
01:00:03,096 --> 01:00:04,927
Give it back, it's Mother's!

478
01:00:05,065 --> 01:00:07,499
Are you out of your mind?

479
01:00:07,634 --> 01:00:11,400
This belongs to me!
I'll do whatever I want with it.

480
01:00:11,538 --> 01:00:12,835
Give it back, you thief!

481
01:00:12,973 --> 01:00:16,704
What did you call me?
After all I've done for you!

482
01:00:16,843 --> 01:00:20,108
Where is the package?
Where did you hide it?

483
01:00:22,082 --> 01:00:24,209
Wait, Seita! Stop there!

484
01:00:25,852 --> 01:00:28,412
Okay, you win.

485
01:00:28,922 --> 01:00:33,222
I'll give all your mother's
kimonos back.

486
01:00:39,232 --> 01:00:41,359
That's everything.

487
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:49,274
Is this Mother's...?

488
01:00:50,176 --> 01:00:51,837
I don't know.

489
01:00:51,978 --> 01:00:56,881
But she sent me things in case
there wasn't enough food.

490
01:00:58,818 --> 01:01:00,809
I've never seen this kimono...

491
01:01:01,621 --> 01:01:03,885
She was fashionable, wasn't she?

492
01:01:06,092 --> 01:01:07,616
Is that all there is?

493
01:01:08,528 --> 01:01:11,463
You really are a greedy boy,
aren't you?

494
01:01:11,598 --> 01:01:14,761
Well, there were more things
in the beginning.

495
01:01:15,068 --> 01:01:19,402
But I had to provide for
you and Setsuko, didn't I?

496
01:01:19,539 --> 01:01:25,171
Ineluctably I had to
exchange kimonos for food.

497
01:01:26,012 --> 01:01:28,310
You know the word,
ineluctably?

498
01:01:28,448 --> 01:01:30,245
Seita.

499
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,951
Mommy is dead.

500
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:41,254
She doesn't need kimonos anymore.

501
01:01:56,343 --> 01:01:57,708
Get out of here.

502
01:01:57,844 --> 01:02:01,336
How dare you call me a thief!
I don't want to see you anymore!

503
01:02:04,084 --> 01:02:05,346
We're moving out.

504
01:04:28,661 --> 01:04:30,356
Seita.

505
01:04:32,665 --> 01:04:35,429
This is our house from now on.

506
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:41,238
Nobody will bother us here.
We'll be safe.

507
01:05:05,198 --> 01:05:07,723
This is the kitchen.

508
01:05:08,835 --> 01:05:10,735
That's the entrance.

509
01:05:11,237 --> 01:05:13,330
Setsuko, give me a hand.

510
01:05:16,643 --> 01:05:21,342
Seita, where's the toilet?

511
01:05:22,248 --> 01:05:23,272
Outside.

512
01:05:23,783 --> 01:05:26,274
Don't worry. I'll come with you.

513
01:05:49,175 --> 01:05:51,575
Look, fireflies.

514
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:47,595
Seita.

515
01:06:53,272 --> 01:06:54,398
The firefly.

516
01:06:55,308 --> 01:06:56,798
It's dead.

517
01:07:29,475 --> 01:07:30,840
What are they for?

518
01:07:31,678 --> 01:07:33,236
For the graves.

519
01:07:33,379 --> 01:07:37,179
Write the fireflies' names on them.

520
01:07:39,052 --> 01:07:41,179
Do they have names?

521
01:07:41,554 --> 01:07:42,646
They do.

522
01:07:43,423 --> 01:07:45,391
They all have one.

523
01:07:50,863 --> 01:07:52,956
"Fusako."

524
01:07:58,738 --> 01:08:00,603
Jirokichi.

525
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:14,215
Kotaro.

526
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:30,298
Kuranosuke.

527
01:08:45,318 --> 01:08:46,444
Yoshiko.

528
01:08:48,688 --> 01:08:53,284
The foal's mane
Is wet with morning dew

529
01:08:53,659 --> 01:08:57,925
Both my hands get wet
When I stroke it

530
01:08:58,297 --> 01:09:03,064
It neighs back to me
When I call its name

531
01:09:03,636 --> 01:09:11,236
Shall we run up
The hill path?

532
01:09:13,045 --> 01:09:16,913
Giddyup, Whoa
Going up the hill

533
01:09:18,184 --> 01:09:22,518
I raised you from
A foal in the hay

534
01:09:22,955 --> 01:09:27,051
Now you're a horse
With shiny fur

535
01:09:27,393 --> 01:09:32,626
Don't get a stomachache
Don't catch a cold

536
01:09:33,065 --> 01:09:40,767
Come on, be strong
And give a big neig

537
01:09:41,974 --> 01:09:45,603
Giddyup, Whoa
Give a big neigh

538
01:10:25,785 --> 01:10:27,878
Setsuko, breakfast.

539
01:10:40,132 --> 01:10:42,566
It's watery.

540
01:10:43,569 --> 01:10:45,833
Don't eat if you don't want to.

541
01:11:13,466 --> 01:11:15,866
I'm still hungry.

542
01:11:39,292 --> 01:11:41,920
You do nothing for the country.

543
01:11:43,763 --> 01:11:44,923
You traitor!

544
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,298
Let's go.

545
01:13:13,853 --> 01:13:15,514
What's wrong, Setsuko?

546
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:19,817
My pooh's runny.

547
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,390
It's a kamikaze mission.

548
01:13:29,769 --> 01:13:33,865
It looks like a firefly.

549
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:36,002
Yes, it does.

550
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:56,617
Setsuko, this is the last kimono.

551
01:13:59,065 --> 01:14:00,498
Stop scratching.

552
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:02,997
It's itchy.

553
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,830
Don't scratch it!

554
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:11,309
Seita.

555
01:14:14,246 --> 01:14:15,838
Have some.

556
01:14:16,849 --> 01:14:17,975
What's this?

557
01:14:18,117 --> 01:14:19,641
It's supper.

558
01:14:22,521 --> 01:14:24,853
And some tea, too.

559
01:14:26,992 --> 01:14:32,430
I'll fry some soy pulp for you too.

560
01:14:35,134 --> 01:14:39,002
Eat as much as you like.

561
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:44,338
Won't you eat some?

562
01:15:04,697 --> 01:15:07,291
You thief!

563
01:15:09,902 --> 01:15:11,096
Setsuko.

564
01:15:11,437 --> 01:15:13,337
Setsuko, I got an apple!

565
01:15:17,176 --> 01:15:19,371
It's not an apple.

566
01:15:19,745 --> 01:15:21,508
It's a potato.

567
01:15:22,047 --> 01:15:24,515
Who cares what it is? Eat it.

568
01:15:26,752 --> 01:15:27,912
I don't want it.

569
01:15:31,524 --> 01:15:33,515
I'II eat it then.

570
01:16:14,099 --> 01:16:15,464
You have to eat this.

571
01:16:17,069 --> 01:16:20,800
Seita, where's Mommy?

572
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:24,342
I want to see Mommy.

573
01:16:26,845 --> 01:16:27,812
Eat it.

574
01:16:28,547 --> 01:16:29,878
I want a candy.

575
01:16:31,417 --> 01:16:32,406
The tin's empty.

576
01:16:32,785 --> 01:16:33,809
No.

577
01:16:35,087 --> 01:16:36,213
You, fool!

578
01:16:53,739 --> 01:16:56,173
Remember the cake from Juchheim?

579
01:16:57,776 --> 01:16:59,971
That was only half a year ago.

580
01:17:08,554 --> 01:17:12,285
And the chocolate Father sent us
from Shanghai...

581
01:17:13,158 --> 01:17:17,993
It feels like it was ages ago but
it was only a year ago.

582
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:25,666
Mommy used to make peach compote.

583
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,338
Oh, yeah...

584
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:35,873
When I had diarrhea, she made
apple puree for me.

585
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:55,826
You said you didn't want any sweets.

586
01:17:56,135 --> 01:17:58,831
You didn't eat the yokan.

587
01:18:04,777 --> 01:18:10,113
I couldn't even swallow dumpling
soup the first time I had it...

588
01:18:13,952 --> 01:18:15,317
Even that's a treat now.

589
01:18:20,092 --> 01:18:22,856
What do you want to eat, Setsuko?

590
01:18:23,495 --> 01:18:27,261
I want tempura.
A platter of sashimi...

591
01:18:27,566 --> 01:18:29,124
And tokoroten jelly.

592
01:18:32,104 --> 01:18:33,128
Great.

593
01:18:36,342 --> 01:18:38,936
When we went out to eat
fish sukiyaki,

594
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:46,274
there was only one egg each but
Mother gave hers to me.

595
01:18:49,955 --> 01:18:52,014
Chinese food from Nanking Town...

596
01:18:52,624 --> 01:18:54,615
Lemonade on an excursion...

597
01:18:59,431 --> 01:19:00,830
It sounds like a dream now.

598
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:11,236
Seita.

599
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:13,037
Yes?

600
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,512
Diarrhea...

601
01:19:21,954 --> 01:19:23,046
Okay.

602
01:20:28,754 --> 01:20:30,415
What are you doing here?

603
01:21:05,424 --> 01:21:06,721
Who's there?

604
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:13,865
What're you doing in my field?
Hey, you!

605
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,932
Stop right there!

606
01:21:17,069 --> 01:21:18,263
I'm sorry.

607
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:21,767
You, thief!

608
01:21:22,941 --> 01:21:23,805
I'm sorry.

609
01:21:43,896 --> 01:21:45,830
Seita?

610
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:46,983
Seita.

611
01:23:47,519 --> 01:23:51,250
Would you care for a candy?

612
01:24:04,703 --> 01:24:06,068
Delicious.

613
01:24:09,875 --> 01:24:11,069
Diarrhea...

614
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:18,209
Oh, no. We have to call the doctor
and give you a shot.

615
01:25:21,379 --> 01:25:24,473
Shosuke Suzuki...

616
01:25:37,996 --> 01:25:43,696
The foal's mane
Is wet with morning dew

617
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:50,636
Both my hands get wet
When I stroke it

618
01:25:52,244 --> 01:26:00,982
It neighs back to me
When I call its name

619
01:26:01,887 --> 01:26:11,592
Shall we run up
The hill path?

620
01:26:14,099 --> 01:26:20,663
Giddyup, Whoa
Going up the hill

621
01:26:31,016 --> 01:26:36,010
I, the Emperor, understand
your apprehension.

622
01:26:36,154 --> 01:26:40,318
However, as world conditions
demand

623
01:26:40,458 --> 01:26:45,054
I have to repress my emotions
and endure the shame

624
01:26:45,197 --> 01:26:49,725
to bring peace to
the world now and forever.

625
01:26:49,868 --> 01:26:54,134
I, the Emperor, shall be with
his nation as long as...

626
01:27:10,555 --> 01:27:11,647
Setsuko.

627
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:14,557
Setsuko.

628
01:27:21,266 --> 01:27:23,029
Seita.

629
01:27:23,435 --> 01:27:26,302
You can have this.

630
01:27:27,606 --> 01:27:29,836
It's yours.

631
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:08,565
Setsuko.

632
01:29:14,512 --> 01:29:15,570
Setsuko.

633
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:26,318
Don't go without me!

634
01:31:48,099 --> 01:31:53,230
"Setsuko's grave"

635
01:36:14,298 --> 01:36:19,258
