1
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,480
Mozart.

2
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,060
Mozart.

3
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,628
Forgive your assassin.

4
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,630
I confess, I killed you.

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,759
Si, I killed you, Mozart.

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,615
Mozart, pieta.
Forgive your assassin.

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,434
Forgive me, Mozart.

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,215
Signore Salieri,
open the door, be good now.

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,900
Signore, 
we have something special for you.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,230
Something you're going to love.

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
Is that good.

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,460
Signore, believe me,

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,500
this is the most delicious thing
I ever ate in my life.

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,595
Really, you don't know
what you're miss...

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,515
All right, that's enough Signore.
Open the door.

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,860
Signore, if you don't open this door...

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,820
we`re gonna eat everything and
we're gonna leave nothing for you.

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,340
And I'm never gonna come
see you again.

19
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,100
Good morning, Father.

20
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Herr Salieri?

21
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,916
Leave me alone.

22
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,717
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.

23
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,160
Do you know who I`am?

24
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,420
That makes no difference.

25
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,835
All men are equal in God's eyes.

26
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
Are they?

27
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,200
Offer me your confession.

28
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,958
I can offer you God's forgiveness.

29
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,860
How well are you trained in music?

30
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,880
I know a little.
I studied it in my youth.

31
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,428
- Where?
- Here in Vienna.

32
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,511
Then you must know this.

33
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,069
I can't say that I do.

34
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
What is it?

35
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,700
It was a very popular tune in its day.

36
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
I wrote it.

37
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,230
Here, how about this?

38
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,405
This one brought down the house
when we played the first.

39
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
Well?

40
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,829
I regret it is not too familiar.

41
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,140
Can you recall no melody of mine?

42
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,873
I was the most famous composer

43
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:12,420
in Europe.

44
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,988
I wrote 40 operas alone.

45
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,380
Here.

46
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,755
What about this one?

47
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,620
Yes, I know that.

48
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,154
That's charming.

49
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,900
I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote that.

50
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I didn't.

51
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,920
That was Mozart.

52
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,760
Wolfgang...

53
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,549
Amadeus Mozart.

54
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,105
The man you accuse yourself of killing.

55
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,596
You've heard that?

56
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Is it true?

57
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,953
For God's sake, my son...

58
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,596
if you have something to confess,
do it now.

59
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,720
Give yourself some peace.

60
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
He...

61
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
was my idol.

62
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,230
Mozart.

63
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,940
I can't think of a time
when I didn't know his name.

64
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,860
I was playing childish games,

65
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,180
when he was playing music
for kings and emperors.

66
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,840
Even the pope in Rome.

67
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,795
I admit, I was jealous,

68
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,300
when I heard the tales they told about him.

69
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,780
None of the brilliant little prodigy,

70
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,556
but of his father,
who had taught him everything.

71
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,991
My father, he did not care for music.

72
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,100
When I told him,

73
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,685
how I wished I could be like Mozart,

74
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,140
he would say, 
"Why? Do you want to be a trained monkey?

75
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,020
You'd like me to drag you around Europe,
doing tricks like a circus freak?".

76
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,900
How could I tell him

77
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,250
what music meant to me?

78
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,300
While my father prayed earnestly to God,

79
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,960
to protect commerce,

80
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
I would offer up,

81
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,510
secretly...

82
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,220
the proudest prayer a boy could think of.

83
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,438
"Lord, make me a great composer.

84
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,468
Let me celebrate your glory through music,

85
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,353
and be celebrated myself.

86
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,420
Make me famous through the world, 
dear God.

87
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,080
Make me immortal.

88
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
After I die...

89
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,700
let people speak my name forever
with love for what I wrote.

90
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
In return...

91
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,920
I will give you my chastity...

92
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,230
my industry...

93
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,300
my deepest humility,
every hour of my life.

94
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Amen".

95
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,990
And do you know what happened?

96
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
A miracle.

97
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,798
My life changed forever.

98
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,220
Of course I knew God had arranged it all.
That was obvious.

99
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,500
One minute I was a frustrated boy
in an obscure little town.

100
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,420
The next I was here...

101
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,005
in Vienna, city of musicians...

102
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,195
and Emperor Joseph, the musical king.

103
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,260
In a few years, I was his court composer. 
Isn't that incredible?

104
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,580
Night after night I sat right next
to the emperor of Austria

105
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,540
playing duets with him,

106
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,870
correcting the royal sight-reading.

107
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,095
Actually, the man had no ear at all.

108
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,245
But what did it matter?

109
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,431
He adored my music.

110
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Tell me.

111
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,620
If you had been me,

112
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,965
wouldn't you have thought
God had accepted your vow?

113
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,740
And believe me, I honored it.

114
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,340
I was a model of virtue.

115
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,740
I kept my hands off women.

116
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,220
I worked hours every day teaching students, 
many of them for free.

117
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,420
Sitting on endless committees
to help poor musicians.

118
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,140
Work and work and work, 
that was all my life.

119
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,276
And it was wonderful.

120
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,875
Everybody liked me.

121
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,910
I liked myself.

122
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,280
Until he came.

123
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,340
He came to Vienna to play
some of his music,

124
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,798
at the residence of his employer,
the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg.

125
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,271
Eagerly, I went there to seek him out.

126
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,276
That night...

127
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,155
changed my life.

128
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,860
As I wandered through the salon,

129
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,660
I played a little game with myself.

130
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,100
This man had written
his first concerto at the age of 4,

131
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,955
his first symphony at 7,
a full-scale opera at 12.

132
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,510
Did it show?

133
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,720
Is talent like that

134
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,593
written on the face?

135
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,354
Which one of them

136
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,152
could he be?

137
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,109
Mozart is not here.

138
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,460
- Stop it.
- I`am.

139
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,940
- Stop it.
- I`am stopping it.

140
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,953
I`am. I'm stopping it. Slowly.

141
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,438
There. You see? I've stopped.

142
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,660
- Now we're going back.
- No.

143
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,420
Yes, yes.
Listen, you don't know where you are.

144
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,240
Here, everything goes backwards.

145
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,076
People walk backwards, and dance backwards, 
and sing backwards and even talk backwards.

146
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,930
- That's stupid.
- Why? People fart backwards.

147
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,840
Ssa-ym-ssik.

148
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,740
Ssa-ym-ssik.

149
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,220
Yes, you are. You are very sick.

150
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,596
No. Say it backwards, shitwit.

151
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Ssa-ym-ssik.

152
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,560
Ssik, kiss.

153
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,029
Ym, my. Ssa.

154
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,674
Kiss my ass.

155
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,940
Em-yrram.

156
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,740
- No, I'm not playing this game.
- Say it, it's serious.

157
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,840
It's very serious.

158
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Yrram.

159
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,120
Marry me.

160
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,860
No... I'm not gonna marry you.
You're a fiend.

161
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,960
Uoy-evol-I-tub.

162
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,700
Tub.

163
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
But I...

164
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,260
love...

165
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,715
But I love you?

166
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,438
- Tihs-ym-tae.
- What?

167
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,620
- Eat.
- Eat.

168
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,598
- Ym, my.
- My.

169
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,925
Tihs. Eat my shit.

170
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,156
You filthy fiend.

171
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,158
You filthy...

172
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,470
My music.

173
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,530
They've started without me.

174
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,509
That was Mozart.

175
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,285
That giggling, dirty creature
I'd just seen crawling on the floor.

176
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,100
- I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
- Indeed.

177
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,660
The Viennese certainly know good music
when they hear it, don't you think?

178
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Certainly.

179
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,310
Your Grace.

180
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,558
Ah, Mozart.

181
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,513
- Why?
- Why what, sir?

182
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,580
Why do I have to be humiliated
in front of my guests,

183
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,020
by one of my own servants?

184
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,620
The more license I allow you,
the more you take.

185
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,020
If His Grace is not satisfied with me,
he can dismiss me.

186
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,660
I wish you to return immediately
to Salzburg.

187
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,940
- Your father is waiting for you there, patiently.
- No, Your Grace.

188
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,995
I mean, with all humility,
I would prefer you dismissed me.

189
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:13,940
It's obvious I don't satisfy.

190
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,300
I have no intention of dismissing you.
You will remain in my service

191
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,960
and learn your place.

192
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,780
On the page it looked...

193
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,700
Nothing.

194
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,560
The beginning was simple, almost comic.

195
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,500
Just a pulse.

196
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,070
Bassoons, basset horns...

197
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,158
like a rusty squeezebox.

198
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,428
And then, suddenly,

199
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,756
high above it...

200
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,595
an oboe.

201
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,040
A single note, hanging there, unwavering.

202
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,820
Until...

203
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,718
a clarinet took it over...

204
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,272
sweetened it into a phrase of such delight.

205
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,815
This was no composition
by a performing monkey.

206
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,115
This was a music I had never heard.

207
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,180
Filled with such longing,
such unfulfillable longing.

208
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,900
It seemed to me I was hearing
the voice of God.

209
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Excuse me.

210
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,500
But why?

211
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,879
Why would God choose an obscene child
to be his instrument?

212
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,530
It was not to be believed.

213
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,117
This piece had to be an accident.
It had to be.

214
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,120
It better be.

215
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,100
How good is he, this Mozart?

216
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,700
He's remarkable, Majesty. 
I heard an extraordinary serious opera of his last month.

217
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,031
- Idomeneo, King of Crete.
- That?

218
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,780
A most tiresome piece. I heard it too.

219
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Tiresome?

220
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,180
A young man trying to impress
beyond his abilities.

221
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,555
Too much spice.

222
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Too many notes.

223
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,700
Majesty...

224
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,205
I thought it was 
the most promising work

225
00:24:04,305 --> 00:24:05,300
I've heard in years.

226
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,980
Well then, we should make some effort 
to acquire him.

227
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,093
We could use a good German composer

228
00:24:12,193 --> 00:24:13,380
in Vienna, surely?

229
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,620
I'm sure he could be tempted
with the right offer. Say...

230
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,100
an opera in German
for our National Theater.

231
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Excellent, sire.

232
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,300
But not German. I beg, Your Majesty.

233
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,598
Italian is the proper language for opera.

234
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,690
All educated people agree on that.

235
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,100
What do you think, Chamberlain?

236
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,820
In my opinion, sire, 
it's time we had a piece in our own language.

237
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,833
Plain German for plain people.

238
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,154
Kapellmeister?

239
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,980
Majesty...

240
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,990
I must agree with Herr Direttore.

241
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,750
German is...

242
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,396
too brute for singing.

243
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,960
Court composer...

244
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,920
what do you think?

245
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,820
I think it's an interesting notion
to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty.

246
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,065
It should really infuriate the archbishop
beyond measure,

247
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,780
if that is Your Majesty's intention.

248
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,875
You are cattivo, court composer.

249
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,838
I want to meet this young man.

250
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:40,660
Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.

251
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,274
Well, there it is.

252
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,720
This is a beautiful wig for you.

253
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,668
It looks so marvelous and I love it.

254
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,880
The other one.

255
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,075
Here is the other one.
I think you will love it.

256
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,180
Here's the third one. 
So? Here we go.

257
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,900
- How do you like it?
- They're all so beautiful.

258
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,720
Why don't I have three heads?

259
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,916
This is funny.

260
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,160
Three heads.

261
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,900
Gentlemen.

262
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,655
- Good morning.
- Morning, Your Majesty.

263
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,500
What do you have for me today?

264
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,460
- Your Majesty, Herr Mozart.
- Yes, what about him?

265
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,560
He's here.

266
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,540
Well, there it is. Good.

267
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,020
Your Majesty, I hope you won't find it improper,
but I've written a little march of welcome in his honor.

268
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,041
What a charming idea, court composer.

269
00:27:16,141 --> 00:27:17,100
May I see?

270
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,620
Just a...

271
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,280
Just a trifle, of course.

272
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,920
- May I try it?
- Majesty!

273
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,055
Let's have some fun.

274
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,912
Delightful, court composer.

275
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,540
May I play it when he comes in?

276
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,340
- You do me too much honor, sire.
- Bring in Herr Mozart, please.

277
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,140
But... slowly, slowly.

278
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,215
I need a minute to practice.

279
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,280
Good, continue.

280
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,076
G, Majesty.

281
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Excellent.

282
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,636
Good, Majesty.

283
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,156
Continue. Very good.

284
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,879
Very good, Majesty.

285
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,434
Tempo. Up.

286
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,300
Lightly, then strongly.
It's a march, Majesty.

287
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Again.

288
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Bravo, Majesty.

289
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,780
Gentlemen, please.
A little less enthusiasm, I beg you.

290
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,349
No, please, please. 
It's not a holy relic.

291
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,900
You know, we have met before.
In this very room.

292
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,260
Perhaps you don't remember it, you were only 6 years old.
He was giving the most delightful concert here.

293
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,980
As he got off the stool, 
he slip and fell.

294
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,900
My own sister Antoinette helped him up.
And you know what he did?

295
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,530
He jumped into her arms and said,

296
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:15,380
"Will you marry me?
Yes or no?".

297
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,220
You know all these gentlemen, I`m sure.
The Baron Van Swieten.

298
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,020
- I'm a great admirer of yours, young men.
- Thank you.

299
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,415
Kapellmeister Bonno.

300
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,940
My pleasure.

301
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,620
The Director of Opera,
Count Orsini-Rosenberg.

302
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,630
Sir, yes. 
The honor is mine, absolutely.

303
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,140
Here is our illustrious court composer,

304
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Maestro Salieri.

305
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,717
At last, such immense joy.

306
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,360
I know your work well, signore.

307
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,454
Do you know, 
I actually composed some variations

308
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:55,060
on a melody of yours.

309
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,100
- Really? Which one?
- "Mio Caro Adone".

310
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,620
I'm flattered.

311
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,820
A funny little tune,
but it yielded good things.

312
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,780
And now he has returned the compliment.

313
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,420
Herr Salieri composed
this little march of welcome for you.

314
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Really?

315
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,900
Well, there it is.
Now...

316
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,091
Down to business. 

317
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:20,220
Young man, we're going to commission 
an opera from you.

318
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
What do you say?

319
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,220
Did we vote in the end for German 
or Italian?

320
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,420
Well actually sire, if you remember,
we did finally incline to Italian.

321
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
Did we?

322
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,725
I don't think it was really decided,
Your Majesty.

323
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,972
German. 
Please let it be German.

324
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:44,740
Why so?

325
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,020
Because I've already found
the most wonderful libretto.

326
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
Have I seen it?

327
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,740
I don't think you have, Herr Direktor,
not yet. It's quite new.

328
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,140
- I'll show it to you immediately, of course.
- I think you'd better.

329
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,980
Well tell us about it.

330
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,914
Tell us the story.

331
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,869
Well, it's quite amusing, Majesty.

332
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,596
It's set... 
The whole thing is set in a...

333
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,394
Yes? Where?

334
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,434
In a harem, Majesty. In a seraglio.

335
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,295
- You mean in Turkey?
- Yes, exactly.

336
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,780
Then why especially
does it have to be in German?

337
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,180
It doesn't, especially. 
It could be in Turkish if you really want.

338
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,820
No, my dear fellow, 
the language is not finally the point.

339
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:53,380
Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate 
for a national theater?

340
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,710
Why not? It's charming.

341
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,511
I mean, I won't actually show concubines 
exposing their...

342
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,580
It's not indecent.
It's highly moral, Majesty.

343
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,460
It's full of proper German virtues.

344
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,820
Excuse me, Majesty, 
but what do you think these could be?

345
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,065
Being a foreigner, I'd love to learn.

346
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,351
Well, tell him, Mozart.

347
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,100
Name us a German virtue.

348
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,033
- Love, sire.
- Oh, love.

349
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,150
Of course, 
in Italy we know nothing about love.

350
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,445
No, I don't think you do.

351
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,060
Watching Italian opera,
all those male sopranos screeching,  

352
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:46,790
stupid fat couples rolling their eyes about. 
That's not love. It's just rubbish.

353
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,476
Majesty, you choose the language.

354
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,140
I'll be my task to set it to the finest music 
ever offered a monarch.

355
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,810
Well, there it is.
Let it be German.

356
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,220
This is yours.

357
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,020
Keep it.
It's already here in my head.

358
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,265
What? On one hearing only?

359
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,517
I think so, sire. Yes.

360
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,760
Show us.

361
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,950
The rest is just the same, isn't it?

362
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,505
That doesn't really work, does it?

363
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,360
Did you try...?

364
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,460
Shouldn't it be a bit more...?

365
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,300
Or this?

366
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
This. Yes.

367
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,785
Better? What do you think?

368
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,474
Grazie, Signore.

369
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,594
All I ever wanted was to sing to God.

370
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,997
He gave me that longing...

371
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,820
and then made me mute. 
Why?

372
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,920
Tell me that.

373
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,580
If he didn't want me 
to praise him with music,

374
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,655
why implant the desire...

375
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,740
like a lust in my body?

376
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,190
And then deny me the talent?

377
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,060
Madame Cavalieri is here 
for her lesson, sir.

378
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,160
Maestro.

379
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,120
Well...?

380
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,554
How do you like it?

381
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,380
It's Turkish.

382
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,980
My hairdresser said everything this year's 
is going to be Turkish.

383
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Does he?

384
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,837
What else did he tell you today?

385
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,020
Come, come. 
Give me some gossip.

386
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,860
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.

387
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,060
News travels fast in Vienna.

388
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,300
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. 
Is it true?

389
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,580
- Yes.
- Is there a part in it for me?

390
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,274
- No.
- How do you know?

391
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,457
Do you know where it's set, my dear?

392
00:37:32,557 --> 00:37:33,100
Where?

393
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
In a harem.

394
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,071
- What's that?
- A brothel.

395
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Come.

396
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,360
Let's begin.

397
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,990
- What does he look like?
- Mozart?

398
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,500
- You might be disappointed.
- Why?

399
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,935
Looks and talent 
don't always go together, Katerina.

400
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,740
Looks don't concern me, maestro.

401
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,913
Only talent interests a woman of taste.

402
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,550
Shall we continue?

403
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
There she was.

404
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,700
I don't know where they met or how.
There she stood.

405
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,075
On stage, for all to see.

406
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,159
Showing off like the greedy songbird she was.

407
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:36,039
Ten minutes of ghastly scales.
Arpeggios.

408
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,575
Whizzing up and down
like fireworks at a fairground.

409
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,789
Understand, I was in love with the girl.

410
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,680
Or at least in lust.

411
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,912
And I swear to you,
I never laid a finger on her.

412
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:11,300
All the same, I couldn't bear
to think of anyone else touching her.

413
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,198
Least of all, "the creature".

414
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,180
Brava, madame.
You are an ornament to our stage.

415
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,280
Your Majesty.

416
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,940
Well, Herr Mozart. A good effort.

417
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,780
Well, decidedly that.

418
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,725
An excellent effort.
You have shown us something quite new tonight.

419
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,157
It is new.

420
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,940
- It is, isn't it, sire?
- Yes, indeed.

421
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,340
So then, you liked it?
You really liked it, sire?

422
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,420
Well, of course I did. It's very good.

423
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,399
Of course, now and then,
just now and then,

424
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,235
it seemed a touch...

425
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,340
What do you mean, sire?

426
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,140
Well, I mean, occasionally,
it seems to have...

427
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,549
How shall one say...?

428
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,580
How shall one say, direktor?

429
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,180
- Too many notes, Your Majesty?
- Exactly. Very well put.

430
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,319
- Too many notes.
- I don't understand.

431
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,980
There are just as many notes, Majesty, 
as I required, neither more nor less.

432
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,740
My dear fellow, there are in fact

433
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,855
only so many notes the ear can hear 
in a course of an evening.

434
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,420
I think I'm right in saying that,
aren't I, court composer?

435
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,876
Yes. On the whole, yes, Majesty.

436
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,100
This is absurd.

437
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,380
Young man, don't take it too hard.
Your work is ingenious.

438
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,180
It's quality work.

439
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,450
And there are simply too many notes,
that`s all.

440
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,820
Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.

441
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,780
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?

442
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,880
Wolfgang.

443
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,233
Wolfgang, my dear.

444
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,719
- Wolfgang.
- Majesty, this is Frau Weber.

445
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,309
She's my landlady.

446
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:57,113
- Enchanted, madame.
- Sire, such an honor.

447
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,820
This is my dear daughter, Constanze.

448
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,915
- She's the fiancée of Herr Mozart.
- Really?

449
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,877
How charming. Please.

450
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,480
Well...

451
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,435
When do you marry?

452
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,660
We haven't exactly received
my father's consent yet.

453
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,548
Not entirely. Not altogether.

454
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,631
- Excuse me, but how old are you?
- 26.

455
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,540
Well, my advice is for you to marry
this charming young lady

456
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,900
- and stay with us in Vienna.
- You see?

457
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,100
I told him that, Your Majesty.
but he won't listen to me.

458
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,829
Your Majesty,
you give such wonderful...

459
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,552
such royal advice. 
May I...?

460
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,239
Well, there it is.

461
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,850
Wolfie, will you get some water?

462
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,010
Will you get some water, please?

463
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,870
Wolfie, get some water.

464
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,695
Excuse me. Excuse me.

465
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,680
Did you know?

466
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,225
- What?
- The marriage.

467
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,060
What does it matter to you?

468
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,850
Nothing. 
He can marry who he pleases,

469
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,245
I don't give a damn.

470
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,876
How was I?

471
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,280
You were sublime.

472
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,390
And what did you think of the music?

473
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,596
Extremely clever.

474
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,600
Katerina, I...

475
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,760
Excuse me.

476
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,580
Is that woman still lying
on the floor?

477
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,834
- No, she's fine.
- Oh, I'm so relieved.

478
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,100
Dear Mozart,
my sincere congratulations.

479
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,940
- Did you like it then?
- How could I not?

480
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,900
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today, 
don't you agree?

481
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,992
She must be dazzling in bed.

482
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,580
I assume she's the virtuoso
in that department.

483
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:05,780
There can`t be any other reason 
why you'd marry someone like that.

484
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,880
Come in.

485
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,740
Excuse me.
Wolfie, Mom isn't feeling very well.

486
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,540
- Can we go home, now?
- Yes.

487
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,860
No, no, no.
You can't take him away now.

488
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,599
This is his night.

489
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,380
Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?

490
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,390
Excuse us, Fraulein.
Good night, signore.

491
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,395
At that moment I knew,
beyond any doubt,

492
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,600
he'd had her.

493
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,540
The creature had had my darling girl.

494
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,155
It was incomprehensible.

495
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,160
What was God up to?

496
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,670
Was it possible I was being tested?

497
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,917
Was God expecting me to offer forgivenes,

498
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,900
in the face of every offense?

499
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,720
No matter how painful?

500
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,920
It's very possible.

501
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,396
But why him?

502
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,816
Why choose Mozart

503
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:20,980
to teach me lessons in humility?

504
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,900
My heart was filling up

505
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,995
with such hatred for that little man.

506
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,140
For the first time in my life,
I began to know

507
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,240
really...

508
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,556
violent thoughts.

509
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,549
Every day, sometimes for hours,
I would pray.

510
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,800
Lord...

511
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,400
please...

512
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,780
send him away,

513
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,519
back to Salzburg.

514
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,475
For his sake...

515
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,629
as well as mine.

516
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,500
- No. I won't have him back.
- But, Your Grace...

517
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:10,754
Your son is an unprincipled,
spoiled, conceited brat.

518
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,080
Yes, sir,

519
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,830
that is the truth.

520
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,140
But don't blame him.
The fault is mine, entirely.

521
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,300
I was too indulgent with him.

522
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,433
Please, Your Grace?

523
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,380
Give him one more chance?

524
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,869
You have leave to try.

525
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:40,073
God bless, Your Grace.
I thank Your Grace.

526
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,280
I thank you.

527
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,020
I write to you with urgent news.
I'm coming to Vienna.

528
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,940
Take no further steps towards marriage 
until we meet.

529
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,100
As you honor the father 
who has devoted his entire life to yours,

530
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,260
do as I bid and await my coming.

531
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,540
I now join you
in the holy bonds of matrimony.

532
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,420
Those whom God hath joined together,

533
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,432
let no man put asunder.

534
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,860
Most beloved father:

535
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,340
Remember how you always told me Vienna is the city of musicians.
To conquer here is to conquer Europe.

536
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,180
With my wife I can do it.
One day soon, when I'm wealthy man,

537
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,190
you'll come and live with us,
and we'll be so happy.

538
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,380
Good morning court composer.
This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.

539
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,780
Your Highness.

540
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,180
She's asked me to advise her  
in a suitable musical instructor.

541
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,980
- I think I've come up with an excellent idea.
- Your Majesty.

542
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,980
It would be such a tremendous honor.

543
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,670
I was thinking of Herr Mozart.
What is your view?

544
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,125
It's an interesting idea,
Majesty, but...

545
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Yes?

546
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,276
My concern is to protect you

547
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,305
from any hint of favoritism.

548
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,140
Favoritism.

549
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,860
- What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
- What is what?

550
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,446
Why must I submit samples of my work
to some stupid committee

551
00:51:48,546 --> 00:51:50,660
just to teach a thirteen-year-old girl?

552
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,399
Because His Majesty wishes it.

553
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,820
Is the emperor angry with me?

554
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,138
Quite the contrary.

555
00:51:58,238 --> 00:52:01,260
Then why doesn`t he simply appoint me 
to the post?

556
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,540
Mozart, you are not 
the only composer in Vienna.

557
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,791
No. But I'm the best.

558
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,680
Mozart.

559
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,885
A little modesty might suit you better.

560
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,260
Who is on this committee?

561
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:28,900
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini-Rosenberg 
and, of course, court composer Salieri.

562
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,675
Naturally, the Italians.
Of course, always the Italians.

563
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,690
They're all musical idiots.

564
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,156
And you want them to judge my music?

565
00:52:41,256 --> 00:52:44,500
Young man,
the issue is quite simple.

566
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,540
If you want this position,

567
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,980
you must submit your stuff,
along with all your colleagues.

568
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,080
Must I?

569
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,100
Well, I won't.

570
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,835
How are we supposed to live, Wolfie?

571
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,940
Do you want me to go 
in the streets and beg?

572
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,040
Don't be stupid.

573
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,740
- All they want to see is your work.
- Shit.

574
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,550
- What's wrong with that?
- Shut up. Just shut up.

575
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,980
One royal pupil,
and all of Vienna will come flocking.

576
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,375
They'll come anyway.

577
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,205
- No, they won't.
- They love me here.

578
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,435
- I know how things work in this city.
- You always know everything, don't you?

579
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,060
- Yes?
- Excuse me, sir.

580
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,100
- There is a lady who insists on talking to you.
- Who is she?

581
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,600
She didn't say,
but she says it's urgent.

582
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,525
Excuse me, my dear.

583
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,320
Your Excellency.

584
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,716
How can I help you?

585
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,266
Frau Mozart?

586
00:54:24,366 --> 00:54:27,500
I've come on behalf of my husband.

587
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,980
I brought you some samples of his work,

588
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,460
so he can be considered 
for the royal appointment.

589
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,081
How charming,

590
00:54:36,181 --> 00:54:39,980
but why did he not come himself?

591
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,878
Well, he's terribly busy, sir.

592
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,200
I understand.

593
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,100
I will look at them of course, 
the moment I can.

594
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,396
It will be an honor.

595
00:54:54,496 --> 00:54:57,500
Please give him my warmest regards.

596
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,980
Would it be too much trouble, sir,
to ask you to look at them now?

597
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,700
- While I wait.
- I'm afraid I'm not at leisure

598
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,340
this precise moment.

599
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:13,020
Just leave them with me.
I assure you, they will be quite safe.

600
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,078
I really cannot do that, sir.

601
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,205
You see, he doesn't know I'm here.

602
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,035
Then he didn't send you?

603
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,755
No, sir. This was my own idea.

604
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,589
- I see.
- Sir, we're desperate.

605
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,478
We really need this job.

606
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,220
My husband spends far more
than he can ever earn.

607
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:45,580
I don't mean that he's lazy because he`s not at all, 
he works all day long.

608
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,912
It's just that he's not practical.

609
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,550
Money simply slips through his fingers. 
It's ridiculous.

610
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,980
Let me offer you some refreshment.

611
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,630
Do you know what these are?

612
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,405
Capezzoli di Venere.
Nipples of Venus.

613
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:13,060
They're Roman chestnuts in brandied sugar. 
Try one. Go on, try one.

614
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,594
They're quite surprising.

615
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,240
They're wonderful.

616
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,980
Thank you very much,
Your Excellency.

617
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,970
Don't keep calling me that.

618
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,375
Keeps me at such a distance.

619
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,780
I wasn't born a court composer,
you know.

620
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,020
I'm from a small town.

621
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,156
Just like your husband.

622
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,273
Are you sure you can't leave this 

623
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,220
and come back again?

624
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,918
It's very tempting, sir.

625
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,580
But it's impossible, I'm afraid.

626
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,820
Wolfgang would be frantic
if he found those were missing.

627
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,639
You see, they're all originals.

628
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:09,110
- Originals?
- Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.

629
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,820
These...

630
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,920
are originals?

631
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,140
Astounding.

632
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,555
It was actually... It was beyond belief.

633
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,834
These were first and only

634
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,476
drafts of music.

635
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:15,078
But they showed no corrections of any kind. 
Not one.

636
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,951
He had simply written down music,

637
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,993
already finished in his head.

638
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:29,559
Page after page of it.
As if he were just taking dictation.

639
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And music...

640
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:42,355
finished as no music is ever finished.

641
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,520
Displace one note,

642
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,540
and there would be diminishment.

643
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,805
Displace one phrase,
and the structure would fall.

644
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,674
It was clear to me.

645
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:06,140
That sound I had heard
in the archbishop's palace

646
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,073
had been no accident.

647
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,670
Here again was the very voice of God.

648
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,380
I was staring through the cage

649
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,220
of those meticulous ink strokes,

650
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,114
at an absolute beauty.

651
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,189
Is it not good?

652
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,760
It is miraculous.

653
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,192
Yes, he's very proud of his work.

654
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,590
So you will help us?

655
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,620
I dine with the emperor
tomorrow evening.

656
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,140
One word from me and the post is his.

657
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,385
Thank you, Your Excellency.
Thank you.

658
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,595
Come back tonight.

659
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,155
- Tonight?
- Alone.

660
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,640
What for?

661
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,310
Some service deserves service in return.

662
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,600
No?

663
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:40,680
- What do you mean?
- Isn't it obvious?

664
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,191
It's a post all Vienna seeks.

665
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,580
If you wish it for your husband,
come tonight.

666
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,380
I'm a married woman, sir.

667
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,480
Then don't.

668
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,600
It's up to you.

669
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,270
And not to be vague,
that is the price.

670
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,997
There is no God of mercy, Father.

671
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,998
Just a God of torture.

672
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,920
Evening came.

673
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,680
I sat there, 
not knowing whether she would return or not.

674
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,676
I prayed as I had never prayed before.

675
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,790
Dear God...

676
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,275
enter me now.

677
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:47,917
Fill me with one piece of true music.

678
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:53,220
One piece with your breath in it,
so I know that you love me.

679
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:59,157
Show me one sign of your favor,
and I will show mine to Mozart.

680
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,759
I will get him the royal position.

681
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,940
Enter me.

682
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,040
Please.

683
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,270
Please.

684
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,680
Yes?

685
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,599
That lady is back, sir.

686
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,840
Show her in.

687
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,240
Well?

688
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,360
I'm here.

689
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,871
My husband has gone to a concert.

690
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,393
He didn't think I would enjoy it.

691
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,393
Well, where shall we go?

692
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,199
Should we stay here?

693
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,680
Well...

694
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,870
Do you still want to look at these?

695
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,905
Or don't we need to bother anymore?

696
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,798
Suppose we don't, really.

697
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,735
Show this woman out.

698
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,080
Stanzi.

699
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,160
Stanzi.

700
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,520
What is it?

701
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,365
What's the matter?
Tell me.

702
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,760
Tell me.

703
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,950
I love you.

704
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,995
I love you.

705
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,770
From now on, we are enemies.

706
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,620
You and I.

707
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,540
Because you choose for your instrument

708
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:58,270
a boastful, lustful, smutty, 
infantile boy,

709
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:04,555
and give me for reward only the ability 
to recognize the incarnation.

710
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,633
Because you are unjust...

711
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
unfair...

712
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,670
unkind...

713
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,700
I will block you.

714
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,800
I swear it.

715
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,740
I will hinder and harm 
your creature on earth,

716
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,070
as far as I`am able.

717
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,940
Majesty, I don't like to talk 
against a fellow musician.

718
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,580
Of course not.

719
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,796
I have to tell you.

720
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,780
Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone 
with young ladies.

721
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,920
Really?

722
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:42,900
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils,
a very young singer,

723
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,060
Maria Theresa Paradis,

724
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,625
told me she was...

725
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,916
Well...

726
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,990
Well, what?

727
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,995
Molested, Majesty.

728
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:02,110
Twice, in the course of the same lesson.

729
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:10,430
Sir, there is a Herr Mozart
waiting for you in the salon.

730
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,940
- Whom did they choose?
- Herr Zummer.

731
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,040
Herr Zummer?

732
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,820
But the man's a fool.
He's a total mediocrity.

733
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:27,596
No, no. 
He has yet to achieve mediocrity.

734
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:33,479
I can't lose this post.
I simply can't.

735
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,720
Excellency, please.

736
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:40,780
Let's go to the palace.
And you can talk to the emperor

737
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,980
and tell him that Herr Zummer
is an awful choice.

738
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:48,100
He could actually do musical harm 
to the Princess Elizabeth.

739
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,939
Between you and me, 
no one in the world

740
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:55,459
could do musical harm 
to the Princess Elizabeth.

741
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,900
Look...

742
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,860
I must have pupils.

743
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,060
Without pupils, I can't manage.

744
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,580
You don't mean to tell me
that you're living in poverty?

745
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,877
No, but I'm broke.

746
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,180
Well, how is this possible?

747
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,380
You give concerts, don`t you?
I hear they`re quite successful.

748
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,392
They're stupendously successful.

749
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,300
You can't get a seat.
The only trouble is no one will hire me.

750
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,220
They want to hear me play,

751
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:31,610
but they won't let me teach their daughters, 
as if I was some kind of a fiend.

752
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,920
Seriously,

753
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,860
is there any chance
you could manage a loan?

754
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:45,100
Only for six months.
Eight, at the most.

755
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,420
You expect your fortunes to change
in six or eight months?

756
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,325
As a matter of fact, I do.

757
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,665
I`am working on something that is

758
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:58,060
going to explode like a bomb shell 
all over Europe.

759
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:03,340
After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna.
I'll pay you back double. Anything.

760
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,460
You name the terms.

761
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,596
Well, how exciting.

762
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,215
Tell me more.

763
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,973
I better not,
it's a bit of a secret.

764
01:09:13,073 --> 01:09:15,660
Come, come, Mozart,
I'm interested.

765
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:18,565
This is delicious. What is it?

766
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,980
It's cream cheese mixed with 
granulated sugar,

767
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:26,380
suffused with rum.
Crema Mascarpone Speciale.

768
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,100
Italian.

769
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:32,660
Forgive me. 
We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.

770
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,580
Two thou...

771
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,036
Two hundred florins.
That's all I need.

772
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,880
A hundred.

773
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,600
Fifty.

774
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,071
What exactly are you working on?

775
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,671
Really, I can't say.

776
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,149
I don't think you should become known

777
01:09:59,249 --> 01:10:01,799
in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.

778
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,760
However...

779
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,240
However, I know a very 
distinguished gentleman

780
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,960
I can recommend to you.

781
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:15,960
And he has a daughter.

782
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,400
Quiet. Quiet.

783
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,600
Herr Mozart.

784
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,460
Welcome. Pay no attention, they're impossible.
Just ignore them.

785
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,340
I treat them just like my own children.

786
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:37,115
Which of them do you wish me to teach?

787
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,670
That's funny.

788
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,993
You're a funny fellow.

789
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:48,620
This is the instrument, Herr Mozart,
I hope it's to your satisfaction.

790
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,740
Of course it'll be to his satisfaction.

791
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,100
Come, we're going to listen to some music. 
Come.

792
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,200
Good boy.

793
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,060
Now.

794
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:10,020
Please play me something,
just to give me an idea.

795
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,236
Anything will do.

796
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,860
Just go ahead.

797
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,758
Just as if we weren't here.

798
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,860
Part of music, getting used to an audience. 
Am I right, Herr Mozart?

799
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,460
Perhaps it would be better
if we were left alone.

800
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,600
I think we're both a little shy.

801
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:30,980
Play.

802
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,152
- I said play.
- Michael, please.

803
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:38,860
Perhaps if I would play something first,
it might encourage the Fraulein.

804
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,935
Why don't you let me try the instrument?

805
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,458
Stop it. Stop.

806
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:54,420
He always howls when he hears music.

807
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,340
We've got to break him of that habit.

808
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,860
We've got to break them of their habit.

809
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,540
Play. Please.

810
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,713
Herr Mozart, play. Please, I beg you.

811
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,876
That's it. That's it.

812
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,915
Keep playing.

813
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,518
Keep playing. That's it.

814
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,277
Mozart, that's wonderful.
Wonderful.

815
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:55,056
Well, next time you wish me 
to instruct another one of your dogs, 

816
01:12:55,156 --> 01:12:56,260
please let me know.

817
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,070
Goodbye, Fraulein.
Goodbye, madam.

818
01:12:58,071 --> 01:12:58,970
Goodbye, sir.

819
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,760
Papa?

820
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,200
Papa.

821
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,720
Why are you here?

822
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,500
Am I not welcome?

823
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,955
Of course, welcome.
Papa, welcome. Welcome.

824
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,380
You're very thin.
Doesn't she feed you, that wife of yours?

825
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:43,580
Feed? Of course she feeds me.
She stuffs me like a goose all day long.

826
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:47,340
- Is she not here?
- No, she had to help her mother.

827
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,260
Yes, she's like that.

828
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:53,950
Her mother's a very sweet woman, 
you'Il...

829
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,872
I didn't know you were home.

830
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,445
Stanzi, this is my father.

831
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,590
We'll wait. We'll wait.

832
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,435
Why don't you get up now,
my darling?

833
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:26,900
She's very tired, poor creature.
You know me. I'm such a pig.

834
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,460
It's not easy cleaning up after me.

835
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,660
Don't you have a maid?

836
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:36,309
Oh. No. We could if we wanted,

837
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:40,685
but Stanzi wouldn`t hear it,
she insists on doing everything herself.

838
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,270
How is your...

839
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,429
financial situation?

840
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,680
Couldn't be better.

841
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,480
That's not what I hear.

842
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,620
What do you mean?
It's wonderful.

843
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:59,340
Really, it's marvelous.
People love me here.

844
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,079
They say you have debts.

845
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,440
Who?

846
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,440
Who says that?

847
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,860
That's a malicious lie.

848
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,076
Do you have pupils?

849
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,518
I don't want pupils.

850
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,069
They get in the way.

851
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:21,100
I have to have time for composition.

852
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,100
Composition doesn't pay.
You know that.

853
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,200
That one will.

854
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,680
What's that?

855
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,620
It's a secret.

856
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,800
Secret?
You don't have secrets from me.

857
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,300
No. Please. I don't want you to see it.
I don't want anyone to see it.

858
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,460
But you are going to be 
so proud of me, Papa.


859
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,830
It`s going to be the best thing that I've ever done. 
The best thing anyone...

860
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,500
There she is.

861
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,700
Look at her. Isn't she beautiful?
Come on now, Papa, confess it.

862
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:00,475
- Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
- Stop it, Wolfie.

863
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,076
I look dreadful.

864
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,780
Are you...

865
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,950
expecting?

866
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,265
Yes, I`am.

867
01:17:09,365 --> 01:17:12,780
Isn't it marvelous?
We're delighted.

868
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:17,220
- May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
- Who wants tea? Let's go out.

869
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:21,060
This calls for a feast.
You don't want tea, do you Papa?

870
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:25,380
I know. Let's go dancing.
Papa loves parties, don't you?

871
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:28,710
How can you be so boring? Tea.

872
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,660
Come on, Papa. Hurry.

873
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,760
Here we go. Good day.

874
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,360
Now.

875
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:28,717
I name the penalty.
I name the penalty.

876
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:32,153
And the penalty is...

877
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:36,273
- Give her a good one.
- Show us your legs.

878
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,115
Come on, come on.

879
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,310
It's just a game, Papa.

880
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,520
Thank you.

881
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:40,755
Herr Mozart, why don't you name 
your son's penalty? 

882
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,872
Yes, Papa. Name it.

883
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:48,610
Name it. 
I'll do anything you say. Anything.

884
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:53,620
I want you to come back 
to Salzburg with me, my son.

885
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:57,220
The rule is you can only give me a penalty 
that can be performed in the room.

886
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,460
I'm tired of this game.
I don`t wanna play anymore.

887
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:03,917
But my penalty.
I've got to have a penalty.

888
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,390
I name a penalty.

889
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,900
The penalty is,

890
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,220
you shall play our little tune

891
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:21,757
in the manner of
Johann Sebastian Bach.

892
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,620
- Turn him over.
- Over? 

893
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,879
Now you play it backwards.

894
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:25,580
- Another one. Give me another one.
- Play it like Gluck.

895
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,319
- Boring. Another.
- Handel.

896
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:31,260
I don't like him. Another one.

897
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,476
Play Salieri.

898
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,940
Now that is a challenge.
That is a challenge.

899
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,719
Please. Please.

900
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,593
Go on. Mock me. Laugh.

901
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,220
That was not Mozart laughing, Father.

902
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,980
That was God.

903
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:31,350
That was God laughing at me
through that obscene giggle.

904
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,230
Go on, Signore. Laugh.

905
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:40,360
Show my mediocrity for all to see.

906
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,393
One day I will laugh at you.

907
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:50,158
Before I leave this earth...

908
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,033
I will laugh at you.

909
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,480
- Wolfie?
- What?

910
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:20,380
There's a young girl here to see you.

911
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,020
What does she want?

912
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:27,305
She won't talk to me.
She says she has to speak to you.

913
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,840
Damn.

914
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Yes?

915
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,185
- Are you Herr Mozart?
- That's right.

916
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:45,340
My name is Lorl, sir.
I'm a maidservant.

917
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:49,340
I was asked to come here
and offer my services to you.

918
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:54,500
They'll be paid for, by a great admirer of yours 
who wishes to remain...

919
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,600
anonymous.

920
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,873
Is this your idea, Papa?

921
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,100
Mine?

922
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:07,140
- Are you playing a trick on me?
- I've never seen this girl in my life.

923
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:10,820
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Not at all, sir.

924
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,300
Young woman, this won't do at all.

925
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:17,740
My son cannot possibly accept such an offer,
no matter how generous,

926
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:22,260
- unless he knows who's behind it.
- But I really can't tell you that, sir.

927
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,540
- This is ridiculous.
- What is ridiculous?

928
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:28,340
Wolfie has many admirers in Vienna.

929
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:31,180
They love him here.
People send us gifts all the time.

930
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,300
You cannot possibly accept her 
without references.

931
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,340
Well, this is none of your business.

932
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:41,140
- Whoever sent you is going to pay?
- That's right, ma'am.

933
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:45,540
Splendid. Now we're going
to let a perfect stranger into our house.

934
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:49,295
Who is we? Who is letting who...?

935
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,980
- Could you please wait outside?
- Yes, ma'am.

936
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,460
Look, old man.

937
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:01,980
We spend a fortune on you,
and all you can do is criticize from morning to night.

938
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,380
- And now...
- Stanzi.

939
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:07,900
No. It's right that he should hear.
I'm sick to death of it.

940
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,460
We can't do anything right for you, 
can we?

941
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:15,340
You won't have to do anything for me 
ever again.

942
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,140
I'm leaving.

943
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:20,340
- No, Papa.
- Don`t worry, I won't stay here to be a burden to anyone.

944
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,440
No one calls you that.

945
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,790
She does. She says I sleep all day.

946
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And so you do.

947
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:32,140
The only time you come out is to eat.

948
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,620
Well, what do you expect?

949
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:41,260
Do you expect anyone to walk out 
into a mess like this every day?

950
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:46,060
- So now I'm a bad housekeeper.
- So you are. This place is like a pigsty all day.

951
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,276
When can you start?

952
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,710
- Right away, ma'am.
- Good.

953
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,279
They're out every night, sir.

954
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,560
Thank you, sir.

955
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:27,610
Do any pupils come to the house?

956
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,040
Not that I've seen.

957
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:34,345
Then how does he pay for all this?

958
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,070
Does he work at all?

959
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:42,957
Yes, sir. All day long. 
He never leaves the house till evening.

960
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:46,180
He just sits there,
writing and writing.

961
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,280
Really?

962
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,575
What is it he's writing?

963
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,794
I wouldn't know that, sir.

964
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,820
Of course not.

965
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,920
You're a good girl.

966
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,420
You're very kind to do this.

967
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:10,360
The next time you're sure 
they'll be out of the house, let me know.

968
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,034
Thank you, sir.

969
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:56,235
I think I found out about the money, sir.

970
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,674
Yes? What?

971
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:04,020
He kept seven snuffboxes in here.
I could swear they were all gold.

972
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,120
And now look.

973
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,316
There's only one left.

974
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,669
Where does he work?

975
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,270
In there, sir.

976
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:04,420
Gentlemen, I've just heard some news
that may be of interest you.

977
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:05,580
What?

978
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:09,878
Mozart is writing a new opera.
An Italian opera.

979
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:12,430
Italian?

980
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:17,665
That's not all.
He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.

981
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,513
The Marriage of Figaro.

982
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:24,290
He's setting that play to music?

983
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,520
Yes.

984
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:30,230
What is this Marriage of Figaro?

985
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:33,925
It's a French play, Kapellmeister.

986
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:37,140
It has been banned by the emperor.

987
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,450
You're absolutely sure?

988
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,870
Herr Mozart.

989
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,095
Gentlemen, sit down.

990
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:54,440
Mozart.

991
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:59,420
Are you aware that I have declared
the French play of Figaro

992
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,325
unsuitable for our theater?

993
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,220
Yes, sire.

994
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:11,525
Yet we hear you're making an opera from it. 
Is this true?

995
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,980
Who told you this, Majesty?

996
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:20,551
It is not your place to ask questions.
Is it true?

997
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:22,760
Yes, I...

998
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:25,275
I admit it is.

999
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,000
Would you tell me why?

1000
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:34,140
Majesty, it is only a comedy.

1001
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:37,020
What you think, Herr Mozart, 
is scarcely the point.

1002
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:40,715
It's what His Majesty thinks that counts.

1003
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,040
But, Your Majesty...

1004
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,200
Mozart...

1005
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,420
I`am a tolerant man.

1006
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:52,705
I do not censor things lightly.
When I do, I have good reason.

1007
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,958
Figaro is a bad play.

1008
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:59,260
It stirs up hatred between the classes.

1009
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:02,380
In France, it has caused nothing but bitterness.

1010
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:07,700
My own dear sister, Antoinette, writes me that 
she is beginning to be frightened of her own people.

1011
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:11,340
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, 
there's nothing like that in the piece.

1012
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:16,260
I've taken out everything that could give offense. 
I hate politics.

1013
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,900
I'm afraid you're rather innocent, my friend.

1014
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,020
In these dangerous times I cannot afford 
to provoke our nobles or our people,

1015
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,460
simply over a theater piece.

1016
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:31,395
Majesty, this is just a frolic.
Is a piece about love.

1017
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,600
"Love". Again.

1018
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,580
And it's new.

1019
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:39,660
It's entirely new.
So new, the people will go mad for it.

1020
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,910
I have scenes...

1021
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:45,140
The end of the second act, for example.

1022
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:49,180
It starts out as a simple duet.
Just a husband and a wife quarreling.

1023
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:52,615
Suddenly, the wife scheming little maid comes in.

1024
01:32:52,715 --> 01:32:54,300
It's a very funny situation.

1025
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,260
Duet turns into trio.

1026
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:59,220
Then the husband's valet comes in.
He`s plotting with the maid.

1027
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:01,140
Trio turns into quartet.

1028
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:04,180
Then a stupid old gardener comes in.
Quartet becomes quintet.

1029
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,280
And so on, on and on.

1030
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,868
Sextet, septet, octet.

1031
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:12,820
How long do you think I can sustain that, Majesty?

1032
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,940
I have no idea.

1033
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,040
Guess.

1034
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,780
Guess, Your Majesty.

1035
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:24,380
Imagine the longest time such a thing could be sustained, 
and then double it.

1036
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,480
Well...

1037
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,040
Six...

1038
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:32,015
seven minutes?

1039
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:38,820
- Eight minutes?
- Twenty, sire. Twenty minutes.

1040
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,315
Twenty minutes of continuous music.

1041
01:33:41,415 --> 01:33:43,420
No recitatives.

1042
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,985
Sire, only opera can do this.

1043
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,860
In a play, if more than one person 
speaks at the same time it´s...

1044
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:51,960
just noise, 
no one can`t understand a word.

1045
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:54,580
But with opera, with music...

1046
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:58,780
with music, you can have 20 individuals,
all talking at the same time.

1047
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:02,060
And it's not noise.
It's a perfect harmony.

1048
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:05,260
Mozart, music is not the issue here.

1049
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:10,540
No one doubts your talent. 
It's your judgment of literature that's in question.

1050
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:16,540
Even with the politics taken out,
this thing it would still remain a vulgar farce.

1051
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:19,460
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?

1052
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:23,540
Surely you can choose 
more elevated themes.

1053
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:26,780
Elevated.
What does that mean, elevated?

1054
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:31,475
I`am fed to the teeth 
with all these elevated things. 

1055
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,825 
Old dead legends.

1056
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,060
Why must we go on forever
writing only about gods and legends?

1057
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:40,160
Because they do.

1058
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,949
They go on forever.

1059
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:47,675
At least what they represent:
The eternal in us.

1060
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:50,420
Opera is here to ennoble us, Mozart.

1061
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:55,110
You and me,
just the same as His Majesty.

1062
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:02,275
"Bello, bello, bello".
Come on now, be honest.

1063
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:07,900
Which one of you would rather listen to your hairdresser
than Hercules, or Horatius or Orpheus.

1064
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,540
People so lofty, 
they sound as if they shit marble.

1065
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,640
What?

1066
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:18,519
Govern your tongue, Mozart.
How dare you.

1067
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,519
Forgive me, Majesty.

1068
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:29,100
I'm a vulgar man.

1069
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:33,535
But I assure you, my music is not.

1070
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:38,832
You are passionate, Mozart.

1071
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:42,828
But you do not persuade.

1072
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:48,915
Sire, the whole opera is finished.

1073
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:52,460
Do you know how much work
went into it?

1074
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:57,680
His Majesty has been
more than patient, Signore.

1075
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:02,020
How can I persuade Your Majesty
if you won´t let me show it?

1076
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:05,032
That will do, Herr Mozart.

1077
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,700
Just let me tell you how it begins.

1078
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,385
May I just do that, Majesty?

1079
01:36:12,485 --> 01:36:16,310
Show you how it begins?
Just that?

1080
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,800
Please.

1081
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,080
Look...

1082
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:26,500
There's a servant down on his knees.
And do you know why?

1083
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:29,980
Not from any oppression, no,
because he's measuring a space.

1084
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,120
And do you know what for?

1085
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,834
His bed. His wedding bed.

1086
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,235
To see if it will fit.

1087
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,520
Late.

1088
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,780
Late.

1089
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,540
On the beat.

1090
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,640
Good.

1091
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,200
Yes.

1092
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Early.

1093
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:13,275
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.

1094
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:21,815
In that case, gentlemen, I think...

1095
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:28,725
I think we should help Mozart all we can.

1096
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:34,620
And do our best to protect him 
against the emperor's anger.

1097
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,720
What anger?

1098
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:38,870
About the ballet.

1099
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:41,790
What ballet?

1100
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:44,310
Excuse me but,

1101
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:50,680
didn't His Majesty specifically forbid 
the ballet in his opera?

1102
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:27,350
- Herr Mozart.
- Yes?

1103
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:30,660
- A word with you, please.
- Certainly, Herr Direktor.

1104
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:32,800
Now, Herr Mozart.

1105
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,340
Five minutes, please.

1106
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,440
Five minutes.

1107
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:39,620
Yes?

1108
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:45,340
Do you not know that His Majesty 
has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?

1109
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:50,150
- Yes but this is not a ballet, this is a dance of Figaro`s wedding.
- Exactly, a dance.

1110
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:54,940
Surely, His Majesty didn't mean prohibit a dance
when it's part of the story, Herr Direktor.

1111
01:38:55,040 --> 01:39:01,245
It's dangerous to interpret His Majesty edicts. 
Give me your score, please.

1112
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,800
Thank you.

1113
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:16,460
What are you doing, Herr Direktor?

1114
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,300
Taking out what you should
never have put in.

1115
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,714
Please. Please.

1116
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,630
I have no one else to turn to.

1117
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:29,300
- What is it?
- It's unbelievable.

1118
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:33,500
The direktor has actually torn up
a huge section of my music.

1119
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,745
They say I have to rewrite the opera.

1120
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:39,669
But it's perfect as it is.

1121
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,180
I can't...

1122
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,748
rewrite what's perfect.

1123
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,900
Please.

1124
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,275
Can't you talk to him?

1125
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,060
Please.

1126
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:53,940
Why bother with Rosenberg?
He's obviously no friend of yours.

1127
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:59,395
I could kill him.
I mean, really. Kill him.

1128
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:03,580
I actually threw the entire score into the fire, 
he made me so angry.

1129
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:09,715
- You burned the score?
- No, my wife took it out in time.

1130
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:12,280
Thank God.

1131
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:19,275
It's not fair that a man like that
should have power over our work.

1132
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:23,610
But there are those
who have power over him.

1133
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:28,365
I think I'll take this up
with the emperor.

1134
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,820
Excellency...

1135
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:32,920
would you?

1136
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:36,525
With all my heart, Mozart.

1137
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,909
Thank you.

1138
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:45,050
Please, Herr Mozart.
"Please, it's not a holy relic".

1139
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,660
I don't need to tell you I said nothing, 
whatever, to the emperor.

1140
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:57,285
I went to the theater ready 
to tell Mozart something, anything.

1141
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:02,236
When suddenly,
in the middle of the third act

1142
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:05,670
to my astonishment, the emperor,

1143
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:10,100
who never attended rehearsals,
suddenly appeared.

1144
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,036
What is this?

1145
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,400
I don't understand.

1146
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,280
Is it modern?

1147
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:39,420
Majesty...

1148
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,260
the Herr Direktor,

1149
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,260
he has removed un balletto

1150
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:48,638
that would have occurred at this place.

1151
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,180
Why?

1152
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:53,460
It is your regulation, sire.

1153
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:56,472
No ballet in your opera.

1154
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Salieri.

1155
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Do you like this?

1156
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:12,589
It's not a question of liking, Majesty.

1157
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:16,455
Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.

1158
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,610
Well, look at them.

1159
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,672
No. This is nonsense.

1160
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,146
Let me see the scene with the music.

1161
01:42:27,246 --> 01:42:28,860
But, sire.

1162
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,460
Oblige me.

1163
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,560
Yes, Majesty.

1164
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:44,460
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?

1165
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,215
Certainly. Certainly, Herr Direktor.

1166
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:56,265
Bring the palace set back in, please.

1167
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:34,020
The restored third act

1168
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:36,429
was bold, brilliant.

1169
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:39,240
The fourth...

1170
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,520
was astounding.

1171
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:52,620
I saw a woman,

1172
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:58,380
disguised in her maid's clothes,
hear her husband speak the first

1173
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:01,860
tender words he has offered her in years.

1174
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:06,476
Simply because he thinks
she is someone else.

1175
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:12,353
I heard the music of true forgiveness
filling the theater,

1176
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:17,150
conferring on all who sat there,
perfect absolution.

1177
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:20,740
God was singing through this little man,

1178
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:23,274
to all the world.

1179
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:25,880
Unstoppable.

1180
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:31,159
Making my defeat more bitter
with every passing bar.

1181
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:11,115
And then, do you know what happened?

1182
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:15,480
A miracle.

1183
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:23,420
With that yawn,

1184
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:27,308
I saw my defeat turn into a victory.

1185
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:34,785
And Mozart was lucky
the emperor yawned only once.

1186
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,300
Three yawns...

1187
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,420
and the opera would fail the same night.

1188
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:42,920
Two yawns, within a week at most.

1189
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:47,675
With one yawn, 
the composer could still get...

1190
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:54,020
Nine performances. Nine.
That's all it's had. And withdrawn.

1191
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:56,315
I know, I know.

1192
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,560
It's outrageous.

1193
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:03,620
Still, if the public doesn't like one's work,

1194
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:06,260
one has to accept the fact gracefully.

1195
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:09,675
But what is it that they don't like?

1196
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:12,180
I can speak for the emperor.

1197
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:13,590
You make too many demands

1198
01:46:13,690 --> 01:46:15,460
on the royal ear.

1199
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:18,128
The poor man can't concentrate 
for more than an hour.

1200
01:46:18,228 --> 01:46:20,308
You gave him four.

1201
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,580
What did you think of it yourself?

1202
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:31,069
Did you like it at all?

1203
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:35,220
I thought it was marvelous.

1204
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:38,890
Of course.
It's the best opera yet written.

1205
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:41,120
I know it.

1206
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:46,035
Why didn't they come?

1207
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:51,460
I think you overestimate
our dear Viennese, my friend.

1208
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:55,020
Do you know you didn't even give them 
a good bang at the end of songs,

1209
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:58,100
to let them know when to clap.

1210
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,555
I know, I know.

1211
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:04,980
Maybe you should give me some lessons in that.

1212
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:07,469
I wouldn't presume.

1213
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:13,500
Nevertheless, at the risk of imposing...

1214
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:17,255
I'd like you to see my new piece.

1215
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:19,900
It would be a tremendous honor for me.

1216
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,315
No, the honor would be all mine.

1217
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:47,200
I believe...

1218
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:49,940
I believe

1219
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:54,630
it is the best opera yet written, 
my friends.

1220
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,840
Salieri.

1221
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:02,740
You are the brightest star
in the musical firmament.

1222
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:06,240
You do honor to Vienna and to me.

1223
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,720
Herr Mozart.

1224
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:37,060
- It was good of you to come.
- How could I not?

1225
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:39,160
Bravo, maestro.

1226
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:42,965
Did my work please you?

1227
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:48,745
I never knew that music like that 
was possible.

1228
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:51,794
- You flatter me.
- No.

1229
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:54,955
One hears such sounds...

1230
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:58,436
and what can one say but: 
Salieri.

1231
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:07,940
Everybody's here and we've got guests.

1232
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:10,980
Bravo. 
Well, I've got some more.

1233
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:14,780
Stanzi, you remember my excellent friend Schikaneder. 
Come in.

1234
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,220
Don't be shy.

1235
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:20,359
- This is a very nice girl, and this...
- Wolfie?

1236
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:23,320
Yes, my love?

1237
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:27,302
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.

1238
01:50:27,402 --> 01:50:28,260
Salzburg?

1239
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:31,420
We were just talking about Salzburg.

1240
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:35,709
Your father is dead.

1241
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:59,708
So rose the dreadful ghost,

1242
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:04,112
from his next and blackest opera.

1243
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:13,500
There on the stage,
stood the figure of a dead commander.

1244
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,220
I knew.

1245
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:17,100
Only I understood,

1246
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:20,500
that the horrifying apparition
was Leopold,

1247
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:23,235
raised from the dead.

1248
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:54,500
Wolfgang had actually summoned up 
his own father,

1249
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:58,170
to accuse his son before all the world.

1250
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:01,440
It was...

1251
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:04,716
terrifying and wonderful to watch.

1252
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:08,200
And now...

1253
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:16,365
the madness began in me.

1254
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:22,460
The madness of a man splitting in half.

1255
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,500
Through my influence, I saw to it.

1256
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:31,420
Don Giovanni was played
only five times in Vienna.

1257
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:35,957
But, in secret,
I went to every one of those five.

1258
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:40,870
Worshiping sound I alone seemed to hear.

1259
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:29,125
And as I stood there,
understanding how

1260
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:32,700
that bitter old man 
was still possessing his poor son,

1261
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:35,520
even from beyond the grave,

1262
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:37,540
I began to see a way,

1263
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:39,460
a terrible way,

1264
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:42,500
I could finally triumph

1265
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:44,600
over God.

1266
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:48,600
Herr Mozart?

1267
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:55,300
I have come to commission
work from you.

1268
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:59,598
- What work?
- A Mass for the dead.

1269
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:01,800
What dead?

1270
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:04,080
Who is dead?

1271
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:06,597
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass

1272
01:58:06,697 --> 01:58:07,860
and never got one.

1273
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:12,460
- Who are you?
- I`am only a messenger.

1274
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:14,676
Do you accept?

1275
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:17,269
You will be well paid.

1276
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:26,670
Do you accept?

1277
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:38,340
Work fast.

1278
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:41,180
And be sure tell no one what you do.

1279
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:44,170
You will see me again soon.

1280
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:20,640
Wolfie?

1281
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:33,479
My plan was so simple...

1282
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:37,115
that it terrified me.

1283
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:43,215
First, I must get the death Mass,
and then...

1284
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:47,535
I must achieve his death.

1285
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:50,920
What?

1286
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,316
His funeral.

1287
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:55,460
Imagine it.

1288
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:58,660
The cathedral,
all Vienna sitting there.

1289
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:03,880
His coffin.
Mozart's little coffin in the middle.

1290
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:06,520
And then...

1291
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,950
in that silence...

1292
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:13,040
music.

1293
02:00:14,160 --> 02:00:16,355
A divine music,

1294
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:19,535
bursts out over them all.

1295
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:23,509
A great Mass of death.

1296
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:28,548
Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart.

1297
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:32,833
Composed by his devoted friend,

1298
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:35,879
Antonio Salieri.

1299
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,540
What sublimity.

1300
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:41,108
What depth.

1301
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:44,278
What passion in the music.

1302
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:48,714
Salieri has been touched by God at last,

1303
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:51,434
and God forced to listen.

1304
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:56,230
Powerless to stop it.

1305
02:00:56,440 --> 02:01:00,435
I, for once, in the end,
laughing at him.

1306
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:11,100
The only thing that worried me
was the actual killing.

1307
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:13,475
How does one do that?

1308
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:17,090
How does one kill a man?

1309
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:20,040
It's one thing

1310
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:22,540
to dream about it.

1311
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:25,757
Very different when you...

1312
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,275
When you have to do it...

1313
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:35,069
with your own hands.

1314
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:46,873
Come in.

1315
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:06,151
Don Giovanni,
I've come to dinner.

1316
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:09,140
Dinner. Are you mad?
I'm a nobleman.

1317
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:12,660
I only ever dine with people 
of my own height.

1318
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:14,760
Stop it.

1319
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:17,120
Be careful. Be careful.

1320
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:20,113
Hold tight.

1321
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:22,750
I'm a famous

1322
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:25,633
horseman.

1323
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:29,958
And we're a famous horsy.

1324
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:35,708
Give me a hoof, my darling.

1325
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:40,869
And I'll give you my heart.

1326
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:45,392
Take me to your stable.

1327
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:48,751
And never more we'll part.

1328
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:58,472
Kill me. Kill me.

1329
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:23,550
We're going to make a soprano stew.

1330
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:28,231
We're going to make a soprano stew.

1331
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:32,035
And when you make a soprano stew.

1332
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:34,240
Shut up.

1333
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:37,470
I'm sick to death of that tune.

1334
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:58,436
Give me some hay, my darling.

1335
02:03:58,680 --> 02:04:02,070
And I'll give you my heart.

1336
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:04,575
Leporello. Some hay.

1337
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:55,200
We hope

1338
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:59,439
you're contented.

1339
02:05:00,640 --> 02:05:03,154
With what

1340
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:07,353
we've presented.

1341
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:14,554
And love our dove of peace...

1342
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:41,460
- What did you think of that?
- It was wonderful.

1343
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:45,725
- He liked the little people. Didn`t you?
- It's all in good fun.

1344
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:48,870
I liked the horse.

1345
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:03,180
I tell you, 
if you played Don Giovanni here,

1346
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:06,220
you would've had a wonderful success.

1347
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:08,100
You belong here.

1348
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:12,340
Not at the snobby court.
You could do anything you like.

1349
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:17,140
The more fantastic, the better.
That's what people want: Fantasy.

1350
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:20,420
You write a proper part for me,

1351
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:22,820
a couple of catchy songs.

1352
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:27,118
I guarantee you a triumph deluxe.

1353
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:32,480
- What do you say?
- How much will you pay him?

1354
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:37,940
Well. I see you brought
your manager with you.

1355
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:40,900
Well, madame,

1356
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,037
how about half the receipts?

1357
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:46,060
Half the receipts.

1358
02:06:46,160 --> 02:06:48,500
- Stanzi.
- I'm talking about now.

1359
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:50,949
How much will you pay him now?

1360
02:06:51,049 --> 02:06:52,020
Down payment.

1361
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:54,120
Down payment?

1362
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:59,260
Who do you think I`am,
the emperor?

1363
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:00,980
I have to go.

1364
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:04,310
Stay here, you'll enjoy this next one.

1365
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:06,980
You not going to do this.

1366
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:09,460
- Why not? Half the house.
- When?

1367
02:07:09,560 --> 02:07:13,540
We need money now. 
Either he pays you now, or you don't do it.

1368
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:15,300
I don't trust that man.

1369
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:18,980
And I don't like what he did with your opera. 
It was common.

1370
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:22,140
Wll, you liked it. Didn`you?
Monkey, punky, flunky.

1371
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:23,740
Half the house.

1372
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:27,860
You'll never see a penny.
I want it here in my hand.

1373
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:31,475
- I'll put it here in your hand.
- Shut up.

1374
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:36,580
You won't put a thing in my hand
until I see some money.

1375
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:39,126
It's embarrassing. 
Can't you think of anyone 

1376
02:07:39,226 --> 02:07:41,620
who could do something for him?

1377
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:45,715
I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause, baron.

1378
02:07:46,040 --> 02:07:50,220
He has succeeded in alienating practically 
the whole of Vienna.

1379
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:52,220
He never pays his debts.

1380
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:56,300
I can't think of anyone
to whom I'd dare recommend him.

1381
02:07:56,400 --> 02:08:00,473
Herr Mozart. What a surprise.

1382
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:03,755
What can I do for you?

1383
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:10,740
Is my pupil still interested
in learning the art of music?

1384
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:12,791
Your pupil is married

1385
02:08:12,891 --> 02:08:15,940
and living in Mannheim, young man.

1386
02:08:16,040 --> 02:08:18,040
Really?

1387
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:28,700
Perhaps your dear wife might care
to profit from my instruction.

1388
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:30,995
What is it, Mozart?

1389
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:33,860
What's the matter with you?

1390
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:35,540
Well,

1391
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:40,380
since it appears no one is eager 
to hire my services...

1392
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:44,090
could you favor me
with a little money instead?

1393
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
What for?

1394
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:54,215
If a man cannot earn, 
he must borrow.

1395
02:08:57,120 --> 02:09:00,265
That's hardly the way to go about it.

1396
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:04,191
You are right, sir. You are right.

1397
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:08,780
But you see, I`am endowed with talent, 
and you with money.

1398
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:10,820
If I offer mine...

1399
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:13,480
you should offer yours.

1400
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:18,590
I'm sorry, no.

1401
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:23,280
Please.

1402
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:27,148
My answer is no, Mozart.

1403
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:35,120
Please.

1404
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,070
Please!

1405
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:18,476
Don't answer it.

1406
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:22,280
Why?

1407
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Tell him...

1408
02:10:26,720 --> 02:10:29,140
Tell him I'm not here.

1409
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:31,240
Tell him...

1410
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:35,340
Tell him I'm working on it.

1411
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:37,476
Come back later.

1412
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:55,703
Am I interrupting something?

1413
02:10:55,803 --> 02:10:55,940
No.

1414
02:10:56,040 --> 02:10:58,759
Good. Where's our friend?

1415
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:00,960
He's not here.

1416
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:05,500
But he's working on it,
he told me to tell you.

1417
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:07,600
Is that it?

1418
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:15,469
Is he happy with it?

1419
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:21,340
What's this? 
A Requiem Mass?

1420
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:24,447
You think I'm in the funeral business?

1421
02:11:24,547 --> 02:11:25,580
Leave that alone.

1422
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:30,100
- Put it down. It's nothing for you.
- I'm sorry.

1423
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:33,020
What have you got for me?

1424
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:35,120
Finished?

1425
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:40,471
- What?
- The vaudeville, what do you think?

1426
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,740
Yes.

1427
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:44,910
- Can I see it?
- No.

1428
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:48,100
Why not?

1429
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:50,835
Because there's nothing to see.

1430
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:00,720
Look...

1431
02:12:01,120 --> 02:12:07,070
I asked you if we could start rehearsals next week 
and you said yes.

1432
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:12,710
- Well, we can.
- So let me see it. Where is it?

1433
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:15,080
Here.

1434
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:20,980
It's all right here in my noodle.
The rest is just scribbling.

1435
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:25,160
Scribbling and bibbling.
Bibbling and scribbling.

1436
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:30,100
- Do you like a drink?
- Look, you little cunt!

1437
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:32,860
Do you know how many people I've hired?

1438
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:35,460
- Leave him alone!
- I'm paying this people! Do you realize that?

1439
02:12:35,560 --> 02:12:39,780
- He's doing his best.
- I`m paying this people to wait. For you it's ridiculous!

1440
02:12:39,880 --> 02:12:43,340
You know what's ridiculous?
Your libretto, that what's ridiculous!

1441
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:46,580
Only an idiot would ask Wolfie
to work on that stuff!

1442
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:49,220
Twelve-foot snakes, magic flutes?

1443
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:52,180
What's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?

1444
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:55,078
Money. Money.

1445
02:12:57,880 --> 02:12:59,880
You're mad.

1446
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:01,900
She's mad Wolfie.

1447
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,993
- Oh, yes?
- Wolfie, write it down.

1448
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:08,200
Just write it down.

1449
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:10,240
On paper.

1450
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:17,500
It's no use to anybody in your head.
To hell with your death mass!

1451
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:20,820
Calm yourself.
What's the matter with you?

1452
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:25,180
- I won't work there anymore.
- Why, what has happened?

1453
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:28,192
You don't know what it's like.

1454
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:31,460
Herr Mozart frightens me.

1455
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:33,340
He drinks all day,

1456
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:37,100
then takes all that medicine
and it makes him worse.

1457
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:39,200
Is he working?

1458
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:43,420
Oh, I`am frightened, sir, really.

1459
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:48,535
- When he speaks, he doesn`t make any sense.
- Is he working?

1460
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:52,190
I suppose so.

1461
02:13:52,720 --> 02:13:57,300
He sits there all the time,
doing some silly opera.

1462
02:13:57,400 --> 02:14:00,540
- Opera?
- Please, don't ask me to go back again.

1463
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:03,860
I'm frightened.
I'm very, very frightened!

1464
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:06,997
Are you sure it's an opera?

1465
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:48,788
I don't have it yet.

1466
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:52,720
Are you neglecting my request?

1467
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:55,952
No. No, I...

1468
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:58,955
I promise you...

1469
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:03,580
I'll give you a wonderful piece,
the best I ever...

1470
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:09,797
This is my wife, Stanzi.

1471
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:13,900
I've been sick,
but I'm all right now, aren't I?

1472
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,125
Yes, sir. He's all right.

1473
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:19,192
And he's working on it very hard.

1474
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:23,980
Give me two more weeks. Please.

1475
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:28,198
The sooner you finish,
the greater your reward.

1476
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:30,440
Work.

1477
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:40,920
Wolfie.

1478
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:46,000
I think you really are going mad.

1479
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:51,580
You work like a slave for that idiot actor
who won't give you a penny.

1480
02:16:51,680 --> 02:16:54,353
And here, this is not a ghost.

1481
02:16:54,560 --> 02:16:59,490
This is a real man,
who puts down real money.

1482
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:03,380
Why on earth won't you finish it?

1483
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:08,625
Can you give me one reason
I can understand?

1484
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:11,796
It's killing me.

1485
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:17,940
You're drunk, aren't you?

1486
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:21,955
Be honest, tell me.
You've been drinking.

1487
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:28,111
It's not fair.
I worry about you all the time.

1488
02:17:28,560 --> 02:17:31,791
I do everything I can to help you.

1489
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:36,300
And all you do is drink
and talk nonsense, and frighten me.

1490
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:38,789
Go back to bed.

1491
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:49,680
Please.

1492
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:53,989
Let me...
Let me sit here.

1493
02:17:56,880 --> 02:17:59,685
Let me stay here with you.

1494
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:28,980
I did it.
And I was proud to do it.

1495
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:32,980
"Leave." I said. 
"Right away. Clear out and take the child with you.

1496
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:37,500
Here is the money and go to the spa 
and get your health back." I was shocked.

1497
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:40,380
Shocked to my foundation when I saw her.

1498
02:20:40,480 --> 02:20:43,780
I couldn't believe my eyes,
poor little thing.

1499
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:47,300
You monster.
No one exists but you, do they?

1500
02:20:47,400 --> 02:20:50,060
You and your music. I warned her.

1501
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:52,980
"Choose a man, not a baby" I said.

1502
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:56,170
"You marry him, you won't have a pot
to piss in." 

1503
02:20:56,270 --> 02:20:58,140
You selfish thing.

1504
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:00,655
Selfish, that's what you are.

1505
02:21:00,755 --> 02:21:04,835
Simply selfish. 
Do you hear me?

1506
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:38,260
Pick him up.

1507
02:24:38,360 --> 02:24:40,360
Pick him up.

1508
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:44,380
Be careful. Come with me.

1509
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:46,480
You, follow me.

1510
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:16,195
- Is it over?
- Yes, it's over. It's over.

1511
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:19,600
Go.

1512
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:01,160
Go, go. Go.

1513
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:03,800
Go. Go.

1514
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:33,320
Where is your wife?

1515
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:38,595
Where is your wife?

1516
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:44,799
She's not well either.
She went to the spa.

1517
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:48,625
You are so good to me.

1518
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:51,792
Truly. Thank you.

1519
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:54,240
Please, please.

1520
02:26:54,680 --> 02:26:58,660
No, I mean to come to my opera.

1521
02:26:58,760 --> 02:27:04,030
You, you are the only colleague of mine 
who came.

1522
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:08,400
Mozart.

1523
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:13,300
I would never miss anything
you had written.

1524
02:27:13,400 --> 02:27:16,676
- It's just a vaudeville.
- No, no.

1525
02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:19,260
It's a sublime piece.

1526
02:27:19,960 --> 02:27:22,340
The grandest operone.

1527
02:27:30,760 --> 02:27:32,760
I tell you...

1528
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:37,850
you are the greatest composer
known to me.

1529
02:27:40,600 --> 02:27:42,725
Do you mean it?

1530
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:49,680
- It's him.
- Who?

1531
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
The man.

1532
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:54,080
He's here.

1533
02:27:56,720 --> 02:27:58,780
Tell him to go away.

1534
02:27:58,880 --> 02:28:03,700
Tell him I'm still working on it.
Don't let him in.

1535
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:05,950
No, no. Wait.

1536
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:07,675
Ask him if he would give me...

1537
02:28:07,775 --> 02:28:10,100
some money now.

1538
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:15,640
Tell him if he would,
it will help me to finish it.

1539
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:33,990
- Salieri?
- Yes.

1540
02:28:35,800 --> 02:28:40,220
- Can we come in?
- Better not. He's sleeping.

1541
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:44,180
- He's all right, though?
- Yes, he's just exhausted.

1542
02:28:44,280 --> 02:28:47,272
He became dizzy, that's all.

1543
02:28:47,480 --> 02:28:51,361
Well, tell him we came by, 
won't you?

1544
02:28:51,461 --> 02:28:52,140
Of course.

1545
02:28:52,240 --> 02:28:55,555
Give him this. That's his share.

1546
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:58,820
- That should cheer him up.
- Indeed.

1547
02:28:58,920 --> 02:29:02,320
And now, good night to you all.
It was...

1548
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:04,400
perfection, truly.

1549
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:06,440
Thank you.

1550
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
What happened?

1551
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:28,400
He said to give you this.

1552
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:33,065
And if you finish by tomorrow night,

1553
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:36,700
he will pay you another hundred ducats.

1554
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:38,800
Another...?

1555
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:42,650
That's too soon. Tomorrow night...

1556
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:45,680
It's impossible.

1557
02:29:48,760 --> 02:29:51,718
- Did he say a hundred?
- Yes.

1558
02:29:57,080 --> 02:29:59,080
It's too soon.

1559
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:04,120
Can I...?
Could I help you?

1560
02:30:07,640 --> 02:30:09,640
Would you?

1561
02:30:12,975 --> 02:30:14,747
Actually you could.

1562
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:24,188
- I wanna go.
- Where?

1563
02:30:24,480 --> 02:30:27,597
- I wanna go back to Vienna.
- Now?

1564
02:30:27,800 --> 02:30:29,800
- Yes.
- Why?

1565
02:30:31,640 --> 02:30:33,640
I feel wrong.

1566
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:37,189
I feel wrong being here.

1567
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:43,540
- Where did I stop?
- The end of the Recordare.

1568
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:45,680
So now Confutatis...

1569
02:30:51,800 --> 02:30:54,180
How would you translate that?

1570
02:30:54,280 --> 02:30:57,850
"Consigned to flames of woe".

1571
02:30:59,080 --> 02:31:01,885
- Do you believe in it?
- What?

1572
02:31:02,880 --> 02:31:06,793
A fire which never dies,
burning you forever.

1573
02:31:08,080 --> 02:31:10,080
Oh, yes.

1574
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:12,920
Possible.

1575
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:17,900
- Come, let's begin.
- We ended in F major.

1576
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:21,197
- Yes.
- So, now, A minor.

1577
02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:31,592
- A minor.
- Yes.

1578
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:37,198
Confutatis. A minor.

1579
02:31:39,400 --> 02:31:41,400
Start with the voices.

1580
02:31:41,440 --> 02:31:44,700
- Basses first. Second beat of the...
- Time?

1581
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:49,460
Common time.
Second beat of the first measure.

1582
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:51,560
On A.

1583
02:31:53,240 --> 02:31:56,020
Second measure, second beat.

1584
02:31:56,120 --> 02:31:57,420
You see?

1585
02:31:57,520 --> 02:31:59,340
- Yes. G-sharp?
- Of course.

1586
02:31:59,440 --> 02:32:03,265
Second beat of the third measure, 
on E.

1587
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:13,190
Do you have me?
Show me.

1588
02:32:30,480 --> 02:32:32,948
Good. Good.

1589
02:32:33,160 --> 02:32:34,780
Now the tenors.

1590
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:38,790
Fourth beat of the first measure, 
on C.

1591
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:43,276
Second measure, fourth beat. D.

1592
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:47,860
- All right?
- Yes, continue.

1593
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:51,790
Second beat of the fourth measure, 
on F.

1594
02:32:57,520 --> 02:33:01,460
Now the orchestra.

1595
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:04,450
Identical notes and rhythm.

1596
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:11,550
First bassoon, tenor trombones,
with the tenors.

1597
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:19,315
- You go too fast.
- Do you have it?

1598
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:22,700
- First bassoon to the trombone what?
- With the tenors.

1599
02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:26,180
- Identical?
- Of course, the instruments doubling the voices.

1600
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:29,900
Now, trumpets and timpani. Trumpets in D. 
Listen to me.

1601
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,355
- I don't understand.
- Listen.

1602
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:34,034
Trumpets in D, tonic and dominant.

1603
02:33:34,134 --> 02:33:35,700
First and third beats.

1604
02:33:37,800 --> 02:33:40,520
It goes with the harmony.

1605
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:48,195
Yes. Yes, yes.

1606
02:33:56,960 --> 02:33:59,340
I understand. And that's all?

1607
02:33:59,440 --> 02:34:02,780
No, now for the real fire.
Strings in unison.

1608
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:05,519
Ostinato, on A. Like this:

1609
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:10,750
Next measure is rising.

1610
02:34:11,880 --> 02:34:15,195
Do you have it? Show me.

1611
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:24,398
- It's wonderful.
- Yes, yes. Go on.

1612
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:33,090
- Write that down.
- Yes, yes.

1613
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:39,700
"Call me among the blessed".

1614
02:34:39,800 --> 02:34:41,460
C major.

1615
02:34:41,560 --> 02:34:46,320
Sopranos and altos in thirds.
Altos on C, sopranos above.

1616
02:34:58,240 --> 02:35:01,020
Sopranos up to F on the second voca?

1617
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:06,558
And on dictus. 
And underneath, just violins. Arpeggios.

1618
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:10,420
Descending scale in eighth notes,
then back to ostinato again.

1619
02:35:10,520 --> 02:35:12,700
- And that`s it. Do you have it?
- You go too fast.

1620
02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:17,220
- Do you have it?
- You go too fast. One moment, please, one moment!

1621
02:35:19,720 --> 02:35:24,990
Good. Show me the whole thing
from the beginning.

1622
02:37:21,640 --> 02:37:24,105
Do you want to rest a bit?

1623
02:37:24,360 --> 02:37:27,080
No, I'm not tired at all.

1624
02:37:32,080 --> 02:37:34,820
We'll stop for a moment.

1625
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:39,900
- Then we'll finish the Lacrimosa.
- I can keep going. I assure you.

1626
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:44,590
Will you stay with me
while I sleep a little?

1627
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:47,135
I'm not leaving you.

1628
02:37:54,160 --> 02:37:56,625
I'm so ashamed.

1629
02:37:57,640 --> 02:37:59,640
Of what?

1630
02:38:00,080 --> 02:38:02,389
I was foolish.

1631
02:38:02,600 --> 02:38:07,615
I thought you did not care for my work, 
or me.

1632
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:12,520
Forgive me.

1633
02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:18,800
Forgive me.

1634
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:16,595
What are you doing here?

1635
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:21,792
Your husband took sick.

1636
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:25,685
I brought him home.

1637
02:39:26,480 --> 02:39:28,480
Why you?

1638
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:33,105
Because, madame, I was at hand.

1639
02:39:36,040 --> 02:39:40,120
Well, thank you very much.
You can go now.

1640
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:43,780
He needs me, ma'am.

1641
02:39:43,880 --> 02:39:45,880
No, he doesn't.

1642
02:39:45,880 --> 02:39:49,793
And I don't want you here.
Just go, please.

1643
02:39:50,480 --> 02:39:54,560
- He asked me to stay.
- And I'm ask...

1644
02:40:22,160 --> 02:40:24,160
I'm back.

1645
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:30,095
I missed you so much.

1646
02:40:33,480 --> 02:40:35,480
If you'd just...

1647
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:40,170
show me that you need me.

1648
02:40:45,160 --> 02:40:48,277
And I'll try to do better too.

1649
02:40:59,560 --> 02:41:01,560
What is this?

1650
02:41:04,360 --> 02:41:08,558
No, Wolfie, not this. Not this.

1651
02:41:12,080 --> 02:41:15,675
You're not to work on this ever again.

1652
02:41:16,720 --> 02:41:18,720
I've decided.

1653
02:41:22,120 --> 02:41:24,680
This is not his handwriting.

1654
02:41:26,360 --> 02:41:28,360
It's mine.

1655
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:31,335
I was assisting him.

1656
02:41:32,200 --> 02:41:35,300
He's not to work on this anymore.

1657
02:41:35,400 --> 02:41:38,800
- It's making him ill.
- But...

1658
02:41:40,200 --> 02:41:42,270
Good night.

1659
02:41:44,680 --> 02:41:49,180
I regret we have no servants
to show you out, Herr Salieri.

1660
02:41:49,280 --> 02:41:52,220
Please respect my wish and go.

1661
02:41:52,320 --> 02:41:54,140
Madame...

1662
02:41:54,240 --> 02:41:56,674
I will respect his.

1663
02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:53,839
Your merciful God.

1664
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:02,180
He destroyed his own beloved,
rather than let a mediocrity

1665
02:46:02,280 --> 02:46:06,445
share in the smallest part
of his glory.

1666
02:46:07,480 --> 02:46:09,480
He killed Mozart.

1667
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,740
And kept me alive to torture.

1668
02:46:12,840 --> 02:46:15,020
Thirty-two years of torture.

1669
02:46:15,120 --> 02:46:17,241
Thirty-two years of slowly

1670
02:46:17,341 --> 02:46:20,660
watching myself become extinct.

1671
02:46:20,760 --> 02:46:22,910
My music...

1672
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:25,120
growing fainter.

1673
02:46:25,160 --> 02:46:27,879
All the time fainter,

1674
02:46:28,080 --> 02:46:30,878
till no one plays it at all.

1675
02:46:31,800 --> 02:46:33,800
And his...

1676
02:46:34,840 --> 02:46:39,500
Good morning, professor.
Time for the water closet.

1677
02:46:39,600 --> 02:46:44,780
Then we have your favorite breakfast.
Sugar rolls. He loves those.

1678
02:46:44,880 --> 02:46:47,440
Fresh sugar rolls.

1679
02:46:47,640 --> 02:46:50,105
I will speak for you, Father.

1680
02:46:50,240 --> 02:46:53,620
I speak for all mediocrities
in the world.

1681
02:46:53,720 --> 02:46:56,460
I`am their champion.

1682
02:46:56,560 --> 02:46:59,195
I`am their patron saint.

1683
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:11,873
Mediocrities everywhere.

1684
02:47:13,280 --> 02:47:15,669
I absolve you.

1685
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:19,360
I absolve you.

1686
02:47:20,160 --> 02:47:22,469
I absolve you.

1687
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:27,274
I absolve you.

1688
02:47:27,960 --> 02:47:30,872
I absolve you all.

1689
02:52:56,640 --> 02:52:57,700
