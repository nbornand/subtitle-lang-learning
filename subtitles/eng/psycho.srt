1
00:01:57,604 --> 00:01:59,856
Our pasta this evening...

2
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,524
is squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth...

3
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:06,820
with goat cheese profiteroles,
and I also have an arugula Caesar salad.

4
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:10,281
For entrees this evening, I have
swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade,

5
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:13,701
rare roasted partridge breast in
raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale.

6
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:16,996
...and grilled free-range rabbit
with herbed french fries.

7
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,874
Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth.

8
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,590
God, I hate this place. It's a chick's
restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia ?

9
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:31,676
Because Bateman won't give
the maitre d' head.

10
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:36,763
Is that Reed Robinson
over there ?

11
00:02:36,846 --> 00:02:39,891
- Are you freebasing or what ?
That's not Robinson. Well, who is it then ?

12
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:42,935
- It's Paul Allen.
- That's not Paul Allen.

13
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:45,396
Paul Allen's on the other side
of the room over there.

14
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,481
Who's he with ?
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

15
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:49,400
They don't have a good bathroom
to do coke in.

16
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:52,360
Are you sure that's Paul Allen over there ?
Yes, McDufus, I am.

17
00:02:52,443 --> 00:02:54,946
- He's handling the Fisher account.
- Lucky bastard.

18
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:59,449
- Lucky Jew bastard.
- Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything ?

19
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,451
I've seen that bastard
sitting in his office...

20
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:03,620
talking on the phone to the C.E.O.s,
spinnin' a fuckin' menorah.

21
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:06,164
Not a menorah.
You spin a dreidel.

22
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:08,165
Oh, my God, Bateman.

23
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:11,252
Do you want me to fry you up some
fucking potato pancakes ? Some latkes ?

24
00:03:11,335 --> 00:03:15,006
No, just... cool it with
the anti-Semitic remarks.

25
00:03:15,089 --> 00:03:19,217
Oh, I forgot. Bateman's dating someone
from the A.C.L.U.

26
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:22,178
He's the voice of reason.
The boy next door.

27
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:25,723
Speaking of reasonable--
Only $570.

28
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,767
That's not bad.

29
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:30,895
A little something
for the purse.

30
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,896
Give her the 50.

31
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,890
Stoli on the rocks.

32
00:04:13,973 --> 00:04:17,310
These aren't good anymore.
It's a cash bar.

33
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:19,687
That'll be $25.

34
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:24,900
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

35
00:04:24,983 --> 00:04:27,611
I wanna stab you to death...

36
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:30,238
and play around
with your blood.

37
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:43,124
What can I get
for you two ?

38
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:09,982
I live in the
American Gardens building...

39
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:12,567
on West 81st Street
on the 11th floor.

40
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,778
My name is Patrick Bateman.

41
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,780
I'm 27 years old.

42
00:05:19,197 --> 00:05:21,157
I believe in
taking care of myself,

43
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,162
in a balanced diet,
in a rigorous exercise routine.

44
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:28,622
ln the morning,
if my face is a little pufffy,

45
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:31,792
I'll put on an icepack
while doing my stomach crunches.

46
00:05:31,876 --> 00:05:33,794
I can do a thousand now.

47
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:55,354
After I remove the icepack,
I use a deeppore cleanser lotion.

48
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,691
In the shower, I use
a water-activated gel cleanser.

49
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:03,361
Then
a honey-almond bodyscrub.

50
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:07,199
And on the face,
an exfoliating gelscrub.

51
00:06:16,748 --> 00:06:19,209
Then I apply
an herb mint facialmasque,

52
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,296
which lleave on forten minutes
while I prepare the rest of my routine.

53
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:29,885
I always use an aftershave lotion
with little or no alcohol,

54
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:33,721
because alcohol dries your face out
and makes you look older.

55
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:35,765
Then moisturizer,

56
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:37,808
then an anti-aging eye balm,

57
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:41,394
followed by a final
moisturizing protective lotion.

58
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:46,066
There is an idea
of a Patrick Bateman.

59
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:50,277
Some kind of abstraction,
but there is no real me.

60
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:53,280
Only an entity--
something illusory.

61
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:55,908
And though I can hide
my cold gaze...

62
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,160
and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours...

63
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:04,040
and may be you can even sense
our life styles are probably comparable,

64
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:07,417
I simply am not there.

65
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:32,314
Good morning.

66
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:35,568
Good morning, Hamilton.
Nice tan.

67
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:44,325
Late.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages ?

68
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:47,911
Ricky Harrison has to cancel.
He didn't say what he was cancelling or why.

69
00:07:47,995 --> 00:07:51,415
I occasionally box with Ricky
at the Harvard Club. Anyone else ?

70
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:54,750
Spencer wants to meet for drinks
at Fluties, Pier 17. When ?

71
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:57,879
After 6:00.
And what should I say ? Negative. Cancel it.

72
00:07:57,962 --> 00:08:01,799
Just say "no"
Just say "no" ?

73
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:03,592
Okay, Jean.

74
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:06,178
I need reservations for three
at Camols at 12:30,

75
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:08,180
and if not there
try Crayons.

76
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:10,764
Allright ?
Yes, sir.

77
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:16,228
Oh, wait. And I need reservations
for two at Arcadia at 8:00 on Thursday.

78
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:18,230
Something romantic ?

79
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:21,399
No.

80
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:24,944
Silly. Forget it.
I'll make them.

81
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:26,988
No, I'll do it.
No, no.

82
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:31,241
Be a doll and just get me a mineral
water, okay ? You look nice today.

83
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:33,911
Don't wear that outfit again.

84
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:35,953
What ? I didn't hear you.

85
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:38,664
I said, do not wear
that outfit again.

86
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:41,751
Wear a dress, a skirt or something.
You don't like this, I take it.

87
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:45,086
Come on.
You're prettier than that.

88
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,590
- Thanks, Patrick.
- I'm not here.

89
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:53,427
And high heels.
I like high heels.

90
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:02,227
Feathered friends for 600.

91
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,604
During courtship,
the male frigate bird...

92
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:07,524
inflates to enormous size
the red pouch found here.

93
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:24,372
And I want
hundreds of thousands of roses.

94
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:26,790
And lots of
chocolate truffles,

95
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:29,251
Godiva, and oysters
in the halfshell.

96
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:32,254
I'm trying to listen to
the new Robert Palmer tape,

97
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:36,757
but Evelyn, my supposed fiance,
keeps buzzing in my ear.

98
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,219
Annie Leibovitz.
We'll get Annie Leibovitz.

99
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:42,595
And we'll have to get
someone to videotape.

100
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:45,890
Patrick,
we should do it.

101
00:09:45,932 --> 00:09:49,393
Do what ?
Get married. Have a wedding.

102
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:51,645
No. I can't take
the time off work.

103
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:54,147
Your father practically owns the company.
You can do anything you like, silly.

104
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:56,942
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I hate that job anyway.

105
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:58,943
I don't see why
you just don't quit.

106
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:03,531
Because I want to fit in.

107
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,750
Williams party.

108
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:19,795
I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace,

109
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:22,839
since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.

110
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:27,427
But we do, and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.

111
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:31,763
Patrick, this is my cousin Vanden
and her boyfriend Stash.

112
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:34,141
They're both artists.
The menu's in braille.

113
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:37,769
I see you've met everyone.
You look awful.

114
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:41,105
Okay. Allright.

115
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:43,232
I'm fairly certain that...

116
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:46,693
Timothy Bryce and Evelyn
are having an affair.

117
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:49,613
Timothy is the only
interesting person I know.

118
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:53,158
I'm almost completely indifferent
as to whether Evelyn knows...

119
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,287
I'm having an affair with Courtney
Rawlinson, her closest friend.

120
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:00,331
Courtney is almost
perfect looking.

121
00:11:00,414 --> 00:11:03,958
She's usually operating on
one or more psychiatric drugs.

122
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:06,461
Tonight, I believe, it's Xanax.
Mmm. Oh.

123
00:11:06,503 --> 00:11:09,672
More disturbing than her drug use,
though, is the fact that she's engaged...

124
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:13,300
to Luis Carruthers, the biggest doofus
in the business.

125
00:11:13,342 --> 00:11:15,636
Tell me, Stash.

126
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:19,263
Do you think Soho is becoming too...
commercial ?

127
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:22,642
- Yes. I read that.
- Oh, who gives a rat's ass ?

128
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,685
Hey, that affects us.

129
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:28,730
Well, what about the massacres in Sri
Lanka, honey ? Doesn't that affect us too ?

130
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,732
Do you know anything about
Sri Lanka ?

131
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,901
How, like, the Sikhs are killing
tons of Israelis over there ?

132
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,986
Come on, Bryce.

133
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,405
There are a lot more important problems
than Sri Lanka to worry about.

134
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:42,076
- Like what ?
- Well, we have to end apartheid, for one,

135
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,497
slow down the nuclear arms race,
stop terrorism and world hunger.

136
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,376
We have to provide food and shelter
for the homeless...

137
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:55,671
and oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights,

138
00:11:55,712 --> 00:11:58,549
while also promoting
equal rights for women.

139
00:11:58,632 --> 00:12:01,008
We have to encourage
a return...

140
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,719
to traditional moral values.

141
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:06,180
Most importantly,

142
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:10,559
we have to promote
general social concern...

143
00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:14,521
and less materialism
in young people.

144
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:18,357
Patrick,
how thought provoking.

145
00:12:54,764 --> 00:12:56,725
Hello.

146
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,519
Hello.

147
00:13:18,494 --> 00:13:21,246
Bleaching ? Are you
trying to say "bleaching" ?

148
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,247
Oh, my God.
Two things.

149
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:25,249
One: You can't bleach a Cerruti.
Out of the question.

150
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,252
Two: I can only get
these sheets in Santa Fe.

151
00:13:28,294 --> 00:13:30,296
These are very expensive sheets,
and I really need them cleaned.

152
00:13:30,378 --> 00:13:33,924
Lady, if you don't shut your
fucking mouth, I will kill you.

153
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:35,550
Now, listen.

154
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:38,178
I have a lunch meeting at Hubert's
in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison.

155
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:40,179
I need those sheets
cleaned by this afternoon.

156
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:43,599
Listen, I can't understand you !
This is crazy ! You're a fool.

157
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:45,643
I can't cope with this
stupid "bitchee" !

158
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:48,228
Understand ?
Christ. Patrick ?

159
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:50,772
Hi, Patrick.

160
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:53,983
I thought that was you.
Hello. This is--

161
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,402
Isn't it ridiculous, coming all the way up here ?
They really are the best.

162
00:13:57,444 --> 00:13:59,488
Then why can't they
get these stains out ?

163
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:02,991
I mean, can you talk to these people
or something ? I'm not getting anywhere.

164
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,993
- Oh, what are those ?
- Well, it's--

165
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:09,247
- Cranberry juice. Cranapple.
- Really ?

166
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:12,082
Listen, if you could talk to them,
I would really appreciate it.

167
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:15,252
I'm really late. I have a lunch
appointment at Hubert's in 15 minutes.

168
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:17,629
Hubert's ?
That moved uptown, right ? Oh, boy.

169
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:19,964
Listen, I've gotta go.
Thank you, Victoria.

170
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:22,007
Maybe we could do lunch
one day next week.

171
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:25,678
I'm downtown quite often. What about
a Saturday ? I'm at work all the time.

172
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:29,347
Next Saturday ?
Can't, I'm afraid. Sure.

173
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,599
At a matinee of LesMis.
Listen, I really gotta go.

174
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:35,478
Oh, Christ.
I'll call you. Okay. Do.

175
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:37,563
Listen, you're dating Lewis,
he's in Arizona.

176
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:39,565
You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans.

177
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:41,483
What could you possibly
be up to tonight ?

178
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:44,402
Stop it. I'm--
On a lot of lithium ?

179
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:47,780
Waiting for Luis to call me.
He said he'd call tonight.

180
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:51,451
Pumpkin ? Pumpkin,
you're dating an asshole.

181
00:14:51,534 --> 00:14:55,328
Mm-hmm. Pumpkin, you're dating the
biggest dickweed in New York.

182
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:59,541
Pumpkin, you're dating
a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.

183
00:14:59,624 --> 00:15:02,710
Patrick, stop calling me
pumpkin, okay ?

184
00:15:02,793 --> 00:15:06,172
I have to go.
Courtney ?

185
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:08,174
Hmm ?
Dinner.

186
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:10,800
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.

187
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:16,222
Dorsia's nice.
Wear something fabulous.

188
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:18,307
Oh,yeah !

189
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:30,568
Dorsia.

190
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:32,820
Um, yes, I know
it's a little late,

191
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:37,532
but is it possible to reserve a
table for two at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps ?

192
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:58,175
...a facialat Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing.

193
00:15:58,217 --> 00:16:01,470
And then,
to the Pottery Barn,

194
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:04,890
where I got this little...

195
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:08,351
silver muffin dish.
Is that Donald Trump's car ?

196
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:10,436
God, Patrick.
Shut up.

197
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,272
You know, Courtney, you should
take some more lithium or have a Diet Coke.

198
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:16,233
Some caffeine might get you
out of this slump.

199
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:19,027
I just want a child.

200
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:21,696
Just two...

201
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,323
perfect...

202
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:26,742
children.

203
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:33,456
Are we here ?
Yeah.

204
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:44,424
This is Dorsia ?
Yes, dear.

205
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:47,218
Courtney, you're gonna have
the peanut butter soup...

206
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:49,887
with smoked duck
and mashed squash.

207
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:53,850
New York Matinee called it
"a playful but mysterious little dish."

208
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:57,769
You'll love it. And then the red
snapper with violets and pine nuts.

209
00:16:57,853 --> 00:16:59,771
I think that'll
follow nicely.

210
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:03,649
Mmm.
Thanks, Patrick.

211
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:12,699
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.

212
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,618
Dorsia.
How impressive.

213
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,912
How on Earth did you get
a reservation there ?

214
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,247
Lucky, I guess.

215
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,291
That's a wonderful suit.

216
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,668
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

217
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:27,754
Mmm, Valentino Couture ?

218
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,922
Uh-huh.
Hmm.

219
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:33,092
It looks so soft.
Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.

220
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:40,015
Hello, Halberstram. Nice tie.
How the hell are you ?

221
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:43,393
Allen has mistaken me for this
dickhead, Marcus Halberstram.

222
00:17:43,477 --> 00:17:46,061
It seems logical because
Marcus also works at P&P,

223
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:48,606
and in fact does
the same exact thing I do.

224
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:52,651
He also has a penchant for Valentino suits
and Oliver Peoples glasses.

225
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:54,652
Marcus and I
even go to the same barber,

226
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:56,946
although I have
a slightly better haircut.

227
00:17:56,988 --> 00:18:00,366
- How's the Ransom account going, Marcus ?
- It's, uh, all right.

228
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,785
Really ? That's interesting.
It's not, uh, not great.

229
00:18:02,826 --> 00:18:05,537
- Oh, well, you know.
- So, how's Cecilia ?

230
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:08,290
- She's a great girl.
- Oh, yeah. I'm very lucky.

231
00:18:08,373 --> 00:18:11,459
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Allen, congratulations on the Fisher account.

232
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:15,004
- Thankyou, Baxter.
- Listen, Paul. Squash.

233
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:22,344
Call me.
How about Friday ?

234
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:26,847
No can do.
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.

235
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:30,392
Greatsea urchin ceviche.

236
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,478
Dorsia on Friday night ?
How'd he swing that ?

237
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:34,562
I think he's lying.

238
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:40,360
- Is that a gram ?
- New card.

239
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:43,362
What do you think ?

240
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:46,031
Whoa-ho.
Very nice.

241
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:50,035
Look at that. Picked them up from
the printer's yesterday.

242
00:18:50,118 --> 00:18:52,036
Good coloring.
That's bone.

243
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,664
And the lettering is something
called Silian Rail.

244
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:58,209
It's very cool, Bateman,
but that's nothing. Look at this.

245
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,669
That is really nice.

246
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,673
Eggshell with Romalian type.
What do you think ?

247
00:19:04,714 --> 00:19:07,591
Nice.

248
00:19:07,675 --> 00:19:12,179
Jesus. That is really super.
How'da nitwit like you get so tasteful?

249
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:14,764
I can't believe that Bryce...

250
00:19:14,848 --> 00:19:17,767
prefers Van Patten's card
to mine.

251
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:20,728
But wait.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

252
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,068
Raised lettering,
pale nimbus... white.

253
00:19:28,152 --> 00:19:30,696
Impressive.
Very nice.

254
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:32,822
Hmm.

255
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,116
Let's see Paul Allen's card.

256
00:19:49,712 --> 00:19:51,547
Look at that subtle
off-white coloring.

257
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:54,508
The tasteful thickness of it.

258
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:57,802
Oh, my God.
It even has a watermark.

259
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:05,058
Is something wrong,
Patrick ?

260
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:07,102
You're sweating.

261
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:38,213
Hello. Pat Bateman.

262
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:40,298
You want some, uh, money ?

263
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:42,300
Some food ?

264
00:20:44,636 --> 00:20:47,137
- Is this what you need ?
- I'm-I'm hungry.

265
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,139
Yeah.
Cold out too, isn't it ?

266
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:57,271
Why don't you get a job ?
If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job ?

267
00:20:57,313 --> 00:20:59,315
I lost my job.

268
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:01,358
Why ? You drinking ?

269
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:05,153
Is that why you lost it ?
Insider trading ?

270
00:21:05,237 --> 00:21:07,447
Just joking.

271
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:10,616
Listen, what's your name ?
Al.

272
00:21:10,699 --> 00:21:12,660
Hmm ? Speak up.
Come on. Al.

273
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:14,954
Get a goddamn job, Al.

274
00:21:15,037 --> 00:21:18,164
You got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you.

275
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:21,793
You gotta get your act together.
I'll help you.

276
00:21:21,876 --> 00:21:25,672
You are so kind, mister.
You're a kind-- You're a kind man.

277
00:21:25,755 --> 00:21:27,673
It's okay.
I can tell.

278
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:31,093
Please, you gotta tell me
what to do. You gotta help me.

279
00:21:31,176 --> 00:21:34,137
I'm so cold,
I'm hungry.

280
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:36,806
You know how bad you smell ?

281
00:21:36,848 --> 00:21:39,976
You reek of shit.
Do you know that ?

282
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,395
Al.

283
00:21:43,478 --> 00:21:46,481
I'm sorry.
It's just that--

284
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:48,483
I don't know.

285
00:21:49,735 --> 00:21:52,111
I don't have anything
in common with you.

286
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:02,996
Oh. Oh, thankyou, mister.
Thankyou.

287
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:06,207
I'm cold out here.

288
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,208
You know what a fucking loser you are ?
What ?

289
00:22:33,773 --> 00:22:36,525
What beautiful skin you have,
Mr. Bateman.

290
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:39,819
So fine,
so smooth.

291
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,870
I have all the characteristics
of a human being--

292
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:53,540
flesh, blood, skin, hair--

293
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:56,876
but not a single, clear,
identifiable emotion,

294
00:22:56,918 --> 00:23:00,379
except for greed and disgust.

295
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,091
Something horrible
is happening inside of me,

296
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:05,092
and I don't know why.

297
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:10,305
My nightly bloodlust
has overflowed into my days.

298
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,100
I feel lethal,
on the verge of frenzy.

299
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:17,395
I think my mask of sanity
is about to slip.

300
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,699
Hey, Mc Cloy,
what do you say ?

301
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:35,244
Hey, Hamilton.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas.

302
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:39,580
Is Allen still handling the Fisher account ?
Ofcourse. Who else ?

303
00:23:39,664 --> 00:23:42,625
Mistletoe alert.
Merry Xmas, Patrick.

304
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:45,252
Merry Xmas, Harry.
Merry Christmas.

305
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:47,587
You're late, honey.
Oh, yes, you are. I'm not late.

306
00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:50,757
I've been here the entire time.
You just didn't see me.

307
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:54,927
Say hello to Snowball.
Snowball says, "Merry Christmas, Patrick."

308
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,472
What is it ?
It's a little baby piggly-wiggly, isn't it ?

309
00:23:58,514 --> 00:24:00,975
It's a Vietnamese
potbellied pig.

310
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:03,393
They make darling pets.
Don't you ?

311
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:05,770
Don't you ?

312
00:24:05,854 --> 00:24:08,898
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a grinch.

313
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:11,191
And what does Mr. Grinch
want for Christmas ?

314
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:13,527
And don't say
breast implants again.

315
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:19,115
Allen. Marcus.
Merry Christmas.

316
00:24:19,198 --> 00:24:22,285
How you been ? Workaholic, I suppose ?
Haven't seen you in a while.

317
00:24:22,368 --> 00:24:26,455
Hey, Hamilton. We're goin' to Nell's.
Limo's out front.

318
00:24:26,496 --> 00:24:29,791
We should have dinner.
Maybe you could bring--

319
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:32,753
Cecilla ?
Yes, Cecilla.

320
00:24:32,836 --> 00:24:35,129
Oh, Cecilla would adore it.

321
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:37,840
Well, then,
let's do it, Marcus.

322
00:24:37,923 --> 00:24:39,925
Great party.
Thanks.

323
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:42,178
Patrick, why is he
calling you Marcus ?

324
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:44,888
Mistletoe alert.

325
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:55,731
Marcus Halberstram
for two at 7:00.

326
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,486
No, l want to know, okay ?
I came here for the cilantro crawfish gumbo,

327
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:05,156
which is, after all, the only excuse
one could have for being in this restaurant,

328
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:07,657
which is, by the way,
almost completely empty.

329
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:11,203
I'm very sorry, sir.
J&B straight, and a Corona.

330
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:13,997
Would you like to hear--
Double Absolut martini.

331
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:16,123
Yes, sir.
Would you like to hear the specials ?

332
00:25:16,207 --> 00:25:18,626
Not if you want
to keep your spleen.

333
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:25,715
This is a real beehive of activity, Halberstram.
This place is hot.

334
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,677
Very hot.
Listen, the mud soup and charcoal arugula...

335
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:31,679
are outrageous here.

336
00:25:31,721 --> 00:25:34,056
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child ofdivorce.

337
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:36,683
Give me a break.

338
00:25:36,725 --> 00:25:42,021
I see they've omitted the pork loin
with lime Jell-O. We should've gone to Dorsia.

339
00:25:42,063 --> 00:25:44,774
I could've gotten us a table.
Nobody goes there anymore.

340
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:49,528
Is that Ivana Trump ?

341
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:53,490
Oh, geez, Patrick. I mean, Marcus.
What are you thinking ?

342
00:25:53,573 --> 00:25:57,326
Why would Ivana
be at Texarkana ?

343
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:01,414
So, uh, wasn't Rothchild originally
handling the Fisher account ?

344
00:26:01,497 --> 00:26:06,084
How'd you get it ?
Well, I could tell you that, Halberstram,

345
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:08,503
but then I'd have to
kill you.

346
00:26:15,175 --> 00:26:19,054
I like to dissect girls.
Did you know I'm utterly insane ?

347
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,350
Great tan, Marcus.
I mean, really impressive.

348
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:26,227
Where do you tan ?
Salon.

349
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:28,563
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.

350
00:26:28,604 --> 00:26:31,898
And, uh, Cecilla.

351
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:34,276
How is she ?
Where is she tonight ?

352
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,279
Cecilla's, uh--
Well, you know Cecilla.

353
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:40,031
I think she's having dinner
with, um, Evelyn Williams.

354
00:26:40,114 --> 00:26:42,950
Evelyn ?
Great ass.

355
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:46,703
Goes out with that loser
Patrick Bateman. What a dork.

356
00:26:46,786 --> 00:26:49,914
Another martini, Paul ?

357
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:57,629
You like
Huey Lewis and the News ?

358
00:26:57,671 --> 00:26:59,882
Um, they're okay.

359
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:05,678
They're early work was a little
too new wave for my taste.

360
00:27:05,762 --> 00:27:08,723
But when Sports
came out in '83,

361
00:27:08,806 --> 00:27:11,808
I think they really came into their own,
commercially and artistically.

362
00:27:15,062 --> 00:27:17,773
The whole album has
a clear, crisp sound,

363
00:27:17,856 --> 00:27:20,524
and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism...

364
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:23,819
that really gives the songs
a big boost.

365
00:27:33,078 --> 00:27:35,537
He's been compared
to Elvis Costello,

366
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:40,292
but I think Huey has a far more bitter,
cynical sense of humor.

367
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:42,294
Hey, Halberstram ?
Yes, Allen ?

368
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:45,254
Why are there copies of the Style
section all over the place ?

369
00:27:45,338 --> 00:27:50,176
Do you-- Do you have a dog ?
A little chow or something ?

370
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:53,136
- No, Allen.
- Is that a raincoat ?

371
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:55,472
Yes, it is.

372
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:58,100
In '87, Huey released this--

373
00:27:58,183 --> 00:28:00,101
Fore, their most
accomplished album.

374
00:28:00,184 --> 00:28:03,854
I think their undisputed
masterpiece is "Hip To Be Square."

375
00:28:03,938 --> 00:28:06,691
The song's so catchy, most people
probably don't listen to the lyrics.

376
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:09,234
But they should,
because it's not just about...

377
00:28:09,317 --> 00:28:12,195
the pleasures of conformity
and the importance of trends.

378
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:16,490
It's also a personal statement
about the band itself. Hey, Paul !

379
00:28:21,912 --> 00:28:25,039
Try getting a reservation
at Dorsia now,

380
00:28:25,123 --> 00:28:28,209
you fuckin' stupid bastard !

381
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:32,254
You fucking bastard !

382
00:29:31,514 --> 00:29:35,101
He was completely naked
and standing up on the table.

383
00:29:35,185 --> 00:29:37,645
He had no clothes on
what so ever, and he--

384
00:29:37,729 --> 00:29:39,646
Patrick ?
Patrick.

385
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,316
Is that you ?

386
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,652
No, Luis, it's not me.
You're mistaken.

387
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:47,820
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.

388
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:52,075
Where are you going ? We're going to Nell's.
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

389
00:29:52,116 --> 00:29:54,910
Ooh.

390
00:29:56,453 --> 00:29:58,372
Where did you get
that overnight bag ?

391
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:02,833
Jean-Paul Gaultier.

392
00:30:14,094 --> 00:30:16,012
When I get
to Paul Allen's place,

393
00:30:16,096 --> 00:30:18,056
I use the keys
I took from his pocket...

394
00:30:18,139 --> 00:30:20,140
before disposing
of the body.

395
00:30:20,224 --> 00:30:23,352
There is a moment
of sheer panic...

396
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:27,814
when I realize that Paul's
apartment overlooks the park...

397
00:30:27,897 --> 00:30:30,566
and is obviously
more expensive than mine.

398
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,530
I calm myself
and move into the bedroom,

399
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:39,783
where I find his suitcase
and start to pack.

400
00:30:39,825 --> 00:30:42,661
It's time for Paul
to take a little trip.

401
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:47,790
Where do I send the bastard ?

402
00:30:47,832 --> 00:30:49,834
Dallas ?

403
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:52,419
Paris ? Singapore ?

404
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:55,630
London ? I'll send
the asshole to London.

405
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:04,138
Hi. This is Paul.

406
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:06,306
I've been called away
to London for a few days.

407
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:09,642
Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.

408
00:31:35,206 --> 00:31:37,167
What is it ?

409
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:40,919
Patrick.
Yes, Jean ?

410
00:31:41,003 --> 00:31:44,173
There's a Mr. Donald Kimball
here to see you. Who ?

411
00:31:44,256 --> 00:31:46,842
Detective Donald Kimball.

412
00:31:49,886 --> 00:31:51,929
Tell him I'm at lunch.

413
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:56,476
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.

414
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,894
Send him in, I guess.

415
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,779
Now, John, you've gotta wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.

416
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:13,698
There are definite do's and don'ts, good buddy,
of wearing a bold-striped shirt.

417
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,117
A bold-striped shirt
calls for solid-colored...

418
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,620
or discreetly patterned
suits and ties.

419
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:22,122
Yes, always tip the stylist
15 percent.

420
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:26,001
Listen,John, I've gotta go.
T. Boone Pickens just walked in.

421
00:32:26,085 --> 00:32:30,755
Just joking. No, don't tip
the owner of the salon.

422
00:32:30,838 --> 00:32:32,757
Okay, John ? Right.

423
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,052
Got it.
Sorry about that.

424
00:32:36,094 --> 00:32:38,720
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.

425
00:32:38,762 --> 00:32:40,722
Was that anything important ?

426
00:32:40,764 --> 00:32:43,850
Oh, that ?
Just mulling over business problems,

427
00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:48,312
examining opportunities, exchanging rumors,
spreading gossip.

428
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:51,565
Hi.

429
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:54,609
I'm Donald Kimball.
Hi. Pat Bateman.

430
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:56,903
Nice to meet you. Sorry to barge
in on you like this.

431
00:32:56,945 --> 00:32:58,989
I know how busy
you guys can get.

432
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,744
So, what's the, uh,
topic of discussion ?

433
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:08,288
I've been hired
by Meredith Powell...

434
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:11,416
to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.

435
00:33:13,334 --> 00:33:15,753
I see, yeah.
Paul's disappearance, yeah.

436
00:33:15,795 --> 00:33:17,922
So it's nothing
that official.

437
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:21,174
- I just have some questions about
Paul Allen and yourself. - Coffee ?

438
00:33:21,258 --> 00:33:23,385
- No, I'm okay.
- Apollinaris ?

439
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,387
No, I'm okay.

440
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,014
Can you bring Mr.--

441
00:33:28,097 --> 00:33:30,766
Kimball. No, I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of Apollinaris.

442
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,935
It's no problem.

443
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:37,731
So, what's the topic
of discussion ?

444
00:33:37,814 --> 00:33:40,525
The disappearance
of Paul Allen.

445
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:44,236
Uh-huh, right.
Well, I, um, haven't--

446
00:33:46,155 --> 00:33:48,949
I haven't heard anything about
the disappearance or anything.

447
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:51,201
Not on page six, at least.

448
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:54,954
- I think his family wants this kept quiet.
- Understandable. Lime ?

449
00:33:54,996 --> 00:33:59,042
- No, really, I'm okay.
- You sure ? I can always get you a lime.

450
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:02,127
Just some preliminary questions that I need
for my own files, okay ?

451
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,171
Shoot.

452
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:06,715
Hold old are you ?
Twenty-seven.

453
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:08,716
Where did you go to school ?
Harvard.

454
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:11,427
Then Harvard Business School.
Your address ?

455
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,721
The American Gardens Building,
West 81st Street.

456
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:17,307
- Nice. Very nice.
- Thanks.

457
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:21,102
What can you tell me about Paul Allen ?
I'm at a loss.

458
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:24,064
He was part of that whole Yale thing.
"Yale thing" ?

459
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:26,982
- Yeah, Yale thing.
- What do you mean, "Yale thing" ?

460
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:30,986
Well, I think for one that he was probably
a closet homosexual...

461
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,029
who did a lot of cocaine.

462
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,156
That "Yale thing."

463
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:39,452
What kind of man was he, besides
the information you've just given ?

464
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,329
- I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
- You feel like that ?

465
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,498
No, not really.

466
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,418
Where did Paul hang out ?

467
00:34:48,502 --> 00:34:50,419
Hang out ?
Yeah, you know, hang out.

468
00:34:50,503 --> 00:34:54,674
Let me think.
Um, the Newport, Harry's,

469
00:34:54,757 --> 00:34:56,717
Fluties, Indochine,

470
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:58,718
Nell's, the Cornell Club,

471
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,179
the New York Yacht Club.
He had a yacht ?

472
00:35:01,221 --> 00:35:05,183
- No, he just hung out there.
- And where did he go to school ?

473
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:07,768
Don't you know this ?

474
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:09,812
I just wanted to know
if you know.

475
00:35:13,898 --> 00:35:16,985
Before Yale, if I remember correctly,
St. Paul's.

476
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:20,029
Listen, I just--
I just wanna help.

477
00:35:20,071 --> 00:35:23,115
I understand.

478
00:35:25,575 --> 00:35:27,536
Do you have any witnesses
or fingerprints ?

479
00:35:27,577 --> 00:35:31,706
Well, there's a message on his answering
machine that says he went to London.

480
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:34,333
- Well, maybe he did, huh ?
- His girlfriend doesn't think so.

481
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:36,544
- But has anyone seen him in London ?
- Actually, yes.

482
00:35:36,627 --> 00:35:39,879
Hmm. But I've had a hardtime
getting actual verification.

483
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:43,800
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there.

484
00:35:43,883 --> 00:35:45,802
But I checked it out,
and what happened is...

485
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:48,220
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth
for Paul, so--

486
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:51,557
- Had his apartment been burglarized ?
- No, actually, it hadn't.

487
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,184
Toiletries were missing, a suit was
gone, so was some luggage. That's it.

488
00:35:55,268 --> 00:35:57,687
I mean, no one's dealing with the
homicide squad yet or anything, right ?

489
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,231
No, not yet.
As I said, we're not sure.

490
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:02,650
Basically, no one's seen
or heard anything.

491
00:36:02,734 --> 00:36:05,527
So typical, isn't it ?
It's just strange.

492
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,113
One day,
someone's walking around,

493
00:36:08,196 --> 00:36:10,699
going to work, alive,
and then--

494
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:13,200
Nothing.

495
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:15,244
People just disappear.

496
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:18,998
The earth just...
opens up and swallows them.

497
00:36:20,332 --> 00:36:23,376
Eerie.
Really eerie.

498
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:31,175
Listen, you'll have
to excuse me.

499
00:36:31,258 --> 00:36:35,512
I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable
at Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

500
00:36:35,596 --> 00:36:39,557
The Four Seasons ?
Isn't that a little far uptown ?

501
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:43,019
I mean, aren't you gonna be late ?
No, there's one down here.

502
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:45,562
Oh, really ? I didn't know that.
Yeah, it's very good.

503
00:36:45,646 --> 00:36:49,775
Listen, if anything else
occurs to you, any information--

504
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:52,526
Absolutely. I'm 100 percent with you.
Great.

505
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,238
And thanks for your time,
Mr. Bateman.

506
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:02,118
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.

507
00:38:01,671 --> 00:38:04,841
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been lookin'.

508
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:09,303
- Would you like to see my apartment ?
- I'm not supposed to.

509
00:38:11,013 --> 00:38:12,931
Do you wanna come
to my apartment or not ?

510
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:19,520
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.

511
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,189
Do you take a credit card ?

512
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:25,859
I'm joking.

513
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,902
Come on. Get in.

514
00:38:38,495 --> 00:38:40,496
I'd like a girl.
Early 20s.

515
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:44,000
Blonde, who does couples.
Couples.

516
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:48,462
And I really can't stress
blonde enough. Blonde.

517
00:38:50,088 --> 00:38:53,216
I'm Paul.

518
00:38:53,258 --> 00:38:56,510
My name's Paul Allen.
You got that ?

519
00:38:56,594 --> 00:39:00,514
You're Christie.
You're to respond only to Christie.

520
00:39:00,598 --> 00:39:02,516
Is that clear ?

521
00:39:12,608 --> 00:39:14,568
That's a very fine chardonnay
you're drinking.

522
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,404
I want you
to clean your vagina.

523
00:39:26,454 --> 00:39:29,581
No. From behind.
Get on your knees.

524
00:39:29,623 --> 00:39:32,459
You have a very nice body.

525
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:45,053
Mm-hmm ?

526
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:47,806
Thank you. Send her up.

527
00:39:50,433 --> 00:39:53,602
Christie,
get out and dry off.

528
00:39:53,686 --> 00:39:56,563
Choose a robe--
not the Bijan--

529
00:39:56,647 --> 00:40:01,109
and come and meet me and our guest in
the living room for drinks.

530
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:10,033
You've arrived.
How lovely.

531
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,035
Let me take your coat.

532
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,871
I'm Paul.
How good of you to come.

533
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,627
Not quite blonde,
are you ?

534
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,629
More dirty blonde.

535
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,172
I'm gonna call you
Sabrina.

536
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:28,341
I'm Paul Allen.

537
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:49,652
So.

538
00:40:49,694 --> 00:40:51,653
Don't you wanna know
what I do ?

539
00:40:55,574 --> 00:40:58,618
No.
No, not really.

540
00:41:00,036 --> 00:41:03,372
Well, I work on Wall Street...

541
00:41:03,456 --> 00:41:05,708
for Pierce & Pierce.

542
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:07,876
Have you heard of it ?

543
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:19,762
You have a really
nice place here, Paul.

544
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:21,805
How much
did you pay for it ?

545
00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:23,932
Well, actually,

546
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:26,851
that's none of your business,
Christie.

547
00:41:26,893 --> 00:41:30,688
But I can assure you,
it certainly wasn't cheap.

548
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,023
No. No smoking.
Not in here.

549
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:37,569
Varda truffle ?

550
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:42,365
I don't want you to get drunk,

551
00:41:42,448 --> 00:41:45,785
but that's a very fine
chardonnay you're not drinking.

552
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,876
Do you like Phil Collins ?

553
00:41:55,918 --> 00:41:58,170
I've been a big Genesis fan
eversince the release...

554
00:41:58,254 --> 00:42:02,258
of their 1980 album Duke.

555
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:07,053
Before that, I really didn't
understand any of their work.

556
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:10,181
It was too artsy,
too intellectual.

557
00:42:10,265 --> 00:42:12,975
It was on Duke where...

558
00:42:13,058 --> 00:42:15,978
Phil Collins' presence
became more apparent.

559
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:23,567
I think Invisible Touch is the group's
undisputed masterpiece.

560
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,073
It's an epic meditation
on intangibility.

561
00:42:32,993 --> 00:42:35,829
At the same time,
it deepens and enriches...

562
00:42:35,912 --> 00:42:39,290
the meaning of
the preceding three albums.

563
00:42:39,373 --> 00:42:42,376
Christie,
take off the robe.

564
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,504
Listen to the brilliant
ensemble playing...

565
00:42:46,588 --> 00:42:49,215
of Banks, Collins
and Rutherford.

566
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:53,635
You can practically hear
every nuance of every instrument.

567
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:55,637
Sabrina, remove your dress.

568
00:42:57,347 --> 00:43:00,809
ln terms of lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer songwriting,

569
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:03,894
this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.

570
00:43:03,978 --> 00:43:06,397
Sabrina, why don't you,
uh, dance a little.

571
00:43:07,899 --> 00:43:10,400
Take the lyrics to
"Land of Confusion."

572
00:43:10,483 --> 00:43:12,611
In this song,
Phil Collins...

573
00:43:12,652 --> 00:43:16,740
addresses the problems
of abusive political authority.

574
00:43:18,407 --> 00:43:22,536
"In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song
of the 1980s...

575
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,914
about monogamy and commitment.

576
00:43:25,997 --> 00:43:29,292
The song is
extremely uplifting.

577
00:43:29,334 --> 00:43:32,754
Their lyrics are
as positive and affirmative...

578
00:43:32,837 --> 00:43:37,090
as, uh, anything
I've heard in rock.

579
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:42,762
Christie,
get down on your knees...

580
00:43:42,845 --> 00:43:45,890
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

581
00:43:45,973 --> 00:43:48,643
Phil Collins' solo career...

582
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,561
seems to be more commercial,

583
00:43:51,645 --> 00:43:54,773
and therefore more satisfying
in a narrower way,

584
00:43:54,856 --> 00:43:59,401
especially songs like "In the
Air Tonight" and "Against All Odds."

585
00:44:01,362 --> 00:44:03,322
Sabrina, don't just stare at it.
Eat it.

586
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:08,368
I also think that
Phil Collins works best...

587
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:12,413
within the confines of the group
than as a solo artist.

588
00:44:12,497 --> 00:44:15,874
And I stress the word "artist."

589
00:44:19,878 --> 00:44:21,797
This is "Sussudio."

590
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,882
A great, great song.
A personal favorite.

591
00:44:35,725 --> 00:44:41,397
Look at the camera.

592
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:19,389
Christie, look at the camera.

593
00:45:34,652 --> 00:45:36,571
Don't touch the watch.

594
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,717
Can we go now ?

595
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,718
We're not through yet.

596
00:46:20,734 --> 00:46:24,112
If they have a good personality and they
are not great looking, then who fucking cares ?

597
00:46:24,196 --> 00:46:26,114
Let's just say
hypothetically, okay ?

598
00:46:26,197 --> 00:46:28,449
What if they have
a good personality ?

599
00:46:28,491 --> 00:46:31,619
I know.
I know.

600
00:46:31,702 --> 00:46:34,288
There are no girls
with good personalities.

601
00:46:34,371 --> 00:46:37,207
A good personality consists
of a chick with a little hard body...

602
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,209
who will satisfy
all sexual demands...

603
00:46:39,292 --> 00:46:41,211
without being too slutty
about things...

604
00:46:41,294 --> 00:46:43,212
and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth shut.

605
00:46:43,295 --> 00:46:45,256
The only girls
with good personalities...

606
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:48,551
who are smart or maybe funny
or halfway intelligent or talented--

607
00:46:48,634 --> 00:46:51,469
though God knows what the fuck that means--
are ugly chicks.

608
00:46:51,553 --> 00:46:53,846
Absolutely. And this is because
they have to make up...

609
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:55,723
for how fucking
unattractive they are.

610
00:46:55,807 --> 00:46:59,017
- Do you know what Ed Gein said about women ?
- Maitre d' at Canal Bar ?

611
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:03,063
- No, serial killer, Wisconsin, in the 50s.
- And what did Ed say ?

612
00:47:03,146 --> 00:47:06,233
"When I see a pretty girl walking
down the street, I think two things.

613
00:47:06,316 --> 00:47:08,734
"One part of me wants to
take her out and talk to her,

614
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:11,279
be real nice and sweet
and treat her right."

615
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:13,781
- And what did the other part
of him think ?

616
00:47:13,823 --> 00:47:16,449
What her head would look like
on a stick.

617
00:47:21,162 --> 00:47:24,540
Hi, guys.
I wanna get your opinion on something.

618
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:28,294
It's my business card.

619
00:47:28,335 --> 00:47:31,754
I decided to get
a new one too.

620
00:47:33,298 --> 00:47:35,216
Oh, it's--

621
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,218
Very nice, Luis.

622
00:47:38,845 --> 00:47:40,679
Thank you.

623
00:47:54,525 --> 00:47:56,651
Listen, what about dinner ?

624
00:47:56,693 --> 00:47:59,529
Is that all you ever have to contribute,
Van Patten ? "What about fucking dinner" ?

625
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:02,657
Cheer up there, Bateman. What's the matter ?
No shiatsu this morning ?

626
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:05,993
Keep touching me like that, you'll draw
back a stump. Hold on there, little buddy.

627
00:48:06,035 --> 00:48:07,995
Excuse me.

628
00:48:44,402 --> 00:48:48,322
God. Patrick.
Why here ?

629
00:48:48,405 --> 00:48:51,033
I've seen you
looking at me.

630
00:48:51,075 --> 00:48:54,327
I've noticed your...

631
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:57,038
hot body.

632
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,123
Don't be shy.

633
00:48:59,207 --> 00:49:01,376
You can't imagine how long
I've wanted this--

634
00:49:01,417 --> 00:49:04,086
ever since that Christmas party
at Arizona 206.

635
00:49:04,169 --> 00:49:07,422
You know, the one you were wearing
that red-striped paisley Armani tie.

636
00:49:11,133 --> 00:49:14,887
I want you.
I want you too.

637
00:49:14,929 --> 00:49:16,889
Patrick.
What is it ?

638
00:49:16,931 --> 00:49:20,058
Where are you going ?

639
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,936
I've gotta return
some video tapes.

640
00:49:30,442 --> 00:49:33,487
Patrick !

641
00:49:56,757 --> 00:49:58,968
Okay, London the--

642
00:49:59,051 --> 00:50:01,887
London, there's, um, a reservation--
Any Paul Allen ?

643
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,347
No. A reservation, but--
Kimball !

644
00:50:04,431 --> 00:50:06,558
I've been wanting to talk with you.
Come into my office.

645
00:50:06,641 --> 00:50:08,559
Jean, greatjacket.
Matsuta ?

646
00:50:08,642 --> 00:50:12,605
Do you remember where you were the night
of Paul's disappearance,

647
00:50:12,646 --> 00:50:14,607
which was on
the 20th of December ?

648
00:50:14,648 --> 00:50:16,691
God.

649
00:50:16,774 --> 00:50:19,861
I guess I was probably
returning video tapes.

650
00:50:23,323 --> 00:50:25,282
I had a date
with a girl named Veronica.

651
00:50:25,324 --> 00:50:27,826
That's not what I've got.
What ?

652
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:30,287
That's not the information
I've received.

653
00:50:30,329 --> 00:50:32,663
Well, I-- Wait.

654
00:50:32,705 --> 00:50:35,708
- What information have you received ?
- Let me see.

655
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:38,628
Well--

656
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:40,629
You were with--
Well, I could be wrong.

657
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:44,299
When was the last time
you were with Paul Allen ?

658
00:50:44,382 --> 00:50:46,635
We'd gone to a new musical...

659
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:50,262
called
Oh, Africa, Brave Africa.

660
00:50:50,346 --> 00:50:53,432
It was a laugh riot.
That was about it.

661
00:50:53,516 --> 00:50:56,893
I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Peto--
No, Orso's.

662
00:50:56,976 --> 00:51:00,230
I hope I've been informative.
Long day, a bit scattered.

663
00:51:00,313 --> 00:51:02,273
I'm a little spent now too.

664
00:51:02,357 --> 00:51:05,484
But how about lunch
in a week or so...

665
00:51:05,526 --> 00:51:07,819
when I've sorted out
all this information ?

666
00:51:07,861 --> 00:51:09,821
Great.
Yes, I'd like that.

667
00:51:09,863 --> 00:51:13,115
And if you could try and pin down
where you were...

668
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:16,827
the night of Paul Allen's disappearance,
it would make my job a lot easier.

669
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:19,163
Absolutely.
I'm with you on that one.

670
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:24,709
Huey Lewis and the News.

671
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:30,673
Great stuff. I just bought it on my way here.
You heard it ?

672
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:35,761
Never. I mean,
I don't really like singers.

673
00:51:35,845 --> 00:51:39,347
Not a big music fan, huh ?
No, I like music.

674
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:44,102
Just they're--
Huey's too black sounding for me.

675
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:46,228
To each his own.

676
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,524
So, lunch next week ?

677
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,526
I'll be there.

678
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,618
Oh !

679
00:52:03,702 --> 00:52:05,704
Oh !

680
00:52:28,098 --> 00:52:31,768
Will you call me before Easter ?
Maybe.

681
00:52:35,438 --> 00:52:37,398
What are you doing tonight ?

682
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,276
Dinner at, uh, River Cafe.

683
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:43,653
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.

684
00:52:45,572 --> 00:52:48,408
I never knew you smoked.

685
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,410
You never noticed.

686
00:52:53,662 --> 00:52:55,956
Listen, Patrick.

687
00:52:56,081 --> 00:52:57,875
Can we talk ?

688
00:53:03,922 --> 00:53:06,299
You look... marvelous.

689
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,260
There's nothing to say.

690
00:53:10,302 --> 00:53:13,889
You're gonna marry Luis.
Isn't that special ?

691
00:53:15,432 --> 00:53:17,350
Patrick ?

692
00:53:21,854 --> 00:53:23,814
Yes, Courtney ?

693
00:53:26,441 --> 00:53:29,152
If I don't see you
before Easter,

694
00:53:29,236 --> 00:53:31,321
have a nice one, okay ?

695
00:53:36,325 --> 00:53:38,285
You too.

696
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,584
Patrick ?

697
00:53:46,668 --> 00:53:48,586
Yeah ?

698
00:53:49,837 --> 00:53:54,508
Nothing.

699
00:54:20,573 --> 00:54:22,532
There is this theory now--
Listen to me.

700
00:54:22,574 --> 00:54:24,534
There is this theory now that if
you can catch the AlDS virus...

701
00:54:24,617 --> 00:54:28,037
by having sex with someone who's infected,
then you can catch anything.

702
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,415
Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy,
hemophilia,

703
00:54:31,498 --> 00:54:34,209
leukemia, diabetes,
dyslexia.

704
00:54:34,293 --> 00:54:37,004
I'm not sure, but I don't think
dyslexia is a virus.

705
00:54:37,087 --> 00:54:39,463
But who knows ?
They don't know that.

706
00:54:39,547 --> 00:54:41,465
Prove it.

707
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:54,977
Oh, God.
What ?

708
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:58,481
It's a fucking milligram of sweetener.
I wanna get high off this,

709
00:54:58,564 --> 00:55:00,858
not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.
It's definitely weak,

710
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,067
but I have a feeling if we do
enough of it, we'll be okay.

711
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:06,613
Can you keep it down ?
I'm trying to do drugs.

712
00:55:06,696 --> 00:55:09,032
Fuck you ! Calm down.
Let's do it anyway.

713
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:11,074
That's right.

714
00:55:11,158 --> 00:55:13,118
That is if the faggot in the next
stall thinks it's okay !

715
00:55:13,202 --> 00:55:15,120
Fuck you !
Hey, fuck you !

716
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:19,957
Sorry, dude. Steroids.

717
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:22,418
Okay, let's do it.

718
00:55:42,311 --> 00:55:45,104
Where did Craig go ?

719
00:55:45,188 --> 00:55:48,608
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.
McDermott went to sign a peace treaty...

720
00:55:48,691 --> 00:55:50,610
between the United States
and Russia.

721
00:55:50,693 --> 00:55:53,445
He's the one behind Glasnost.

722
00:55:53,529 --> 00:55:56,990
- He said he was in mergers and acquisitions.
- You're not confused, are you ?

723
00:55:57,074 --> 00:55:59,117
No, not really.

724
00:55:59,201 --> 00:56:02,036
Gorbachev is not downstairs.
- Karen's right.

725
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:04,789
Gorbachev's not downstairs.
He's at Tunnel.

726
00:56:04,872 --> 00:56:06,791
Ask me a question.

727
00:56:08,167 --> 00:56:10,126
So, what do you do ?

728
00:56:10,168 --> 00:56:13,630
I'm into, uh, well, murders
and executions, mostly.

729
00:56:13,713 --> 00:56:17,550
- Do you like it ?
- Well, it depends. Why ?

730
00:56:17,633 --> 00:56:22,888
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers
and acquisitions really don't like it.

731
00:56:25,306 --> 00:56:28,893
So, where do you work out ?

732
00:56:31,604 --> 00:56:34,106
You think I'm dumb,
don't you ?

733
00:56:34,148 --> 00:56:37,276
What ? You think I'm dumb.
You think all models are dumb.

734
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,195
No.
I really don't.

735
00:56:40,279 --> 00:56:43,030
That's okay.
I don't mind.

736
00:56:43,114 --> 00:56:45,032
There's something sweet
about you.

737
00:57:11,514 --> 00:57:13,475
Doin' the crossword ?

738
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,772
You need any help ?

739
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,658
-Jean ?
- Yes, Patrick ?

740
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,037
Would you like to accompany me
to dinner ?

741
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:39,997
That is,
if you're not doing anything.

742
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,833
Um, no. No,
I don't have any plans.

743
00:57:45,085 --> 00:57:47,045
Well,

744
00:57:49,214 --> 00:57:51,299
isn't this a coincidence ?

745
00:57:51,382 --> 00:57:53,676
Listen, where should we go ?
Anywhere you want.

746
00:57:53,718 --> 00:57:56,720
Let's not think about what I want.
How about anywhere you want ?

747
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,308
I don't know, Patrick.
I can't make this decision.

748
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:05,102
Come on.
Where do you wanna go ?

749
00:58:05,186 --> 00:58:10,024
Anywhere you want, just say it.
I can get us in anywhere.

750
00:58:10,066 --> 00:58:12,025
What about...

751
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:22,118
Dorsia ?

752
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,875
So,

753
00:58:30,917 --> 00:58:33,461
Dorsia is where
Jean wants to go.

754
00:58:33,545 --> 00:58:37,172
Well, I don't know.
We'll go wherever you wanna go.

755
00:58:37,256 --> 00:58:39,174
Dorsia is fine.

756
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:47,473
Dorsia. Yes ?

757
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:51,727
Yeah, can you take two tonight at,
oh, let's say 9:00 ? We're totally booked.

758
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:53,728
Really ? That's great.

759
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:57,315
No, I said we are totally booked.
Two at 9:00 ? Perfect.

760
00:58:57,399 --> 00:58:59,401
See ya then.

761
00:59:02,111 --> 00:59:04,447
Yeah ?

762
00:59:04,488 --> 00:59:07,950
You're... dressed okay.

763
00:59:07,992 --> 00:59:12,245
- You didn't give a name.
- They know me.

764
00:59:13,413 --> 00:59:17,040
Why don't you meet me
at my place at 7:00...

765
00:59:17,124 --> 00:59:19,501
for drinks.

766
00:59:19,585 --> 00:59:21,503
And Jean,

767
00:59:21,587 --> 00:59:23,589
you'll wanna change
before we go out.

768
00:59:32,013 --> 00:59:34,097
Patrick, it's so elegant.

769
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:36,183
What a wonderful view.

770
00:59:36,266 --> 00:59:38,685
Jean,

771
00:59:38,769 --> 00:59:40,687
sorbet ?

772
00:59:42,313 --> 00:59:44,607
Thanks, Patrick.
I'd love some.

773
00:59:50,695 --> 00:59:54,449
Do you want a bite ?
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

774
00:59:54,532 --> 00:59:57,993
You don't need to lose any weight.
You're kidding, right ?

775
00:59:58,076 --> 01:00:00,120
You look great.
Very fit.

776
01:00:01,413 --> 01:00:04,541
You can always be thinner,
look better.

777
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:09,086
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner.
I don't wanna ruin your will power.

778
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:11,923
No, it's all right.

779
01:00:12,006 --> 01:00:15,425
I'm not very good
at controlling it anyway.

780
01:00:18,053 --> 01:00:20,013
So listen.

781
01:00:20,055 --> 01:00:23,140
What do you really
wanna do with your life ?

782
01:00:23,224 --> 01:00:25,476
Just briefly, summarize.

783
01:00:25,518 --> 01:00:28,395
And don't tell me you enjoy working
with children, okay ?

784
01:00:28,479 --> 01:00:32,857
Well, I'd like to travel
and maybe go back to school,

785
01:00:32,899 --> 01:00:35,860
but I don't really know.

786
01:00:35,944 --> 01:00:40,322
I'm at a point in my life where
there seems to be so many possibilities,

787
01:00:40,447 --> 01:00:43,909
but I'm-- I don't know--
I'm just so unsure.

788
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:50,081
Do you have a boyfriend ?

789
01:00:50,164 --> 01:00:53,918
No, not really.
Interesting.

790
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,629
Are you seeing anyone ?
I mean, seriously ?

791
01:00:57,712 --> 01:01:00,048
Maybe.

792
01:01:00,132 --> 01:01:03,260
I don't know.
Not really.

793
01:01:06,387 --> 01:01:08,305
Jean,

794
01:01:08,389 --> 01:01:11,058
do you feel... fulfilled ?

795
01:01:11,142 --> 01:01:13,768
I mean, in your life ?

796
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:16,813
I guess I do. For a long time
I was too focused on my work.

797
01:01:16,855 --> 01:01:21,984
But now I've really begun to think
about changing myself, you know,

798
01:01:22,067 --> 01:01:24,570
developing and growing.

799
01:01:24,653 --> 01:01:27,865
Growing.
I'm glad you said that.

800
01:01:30,158 --> 01:01:34,537
Did you know that, uh,
Ted Bundy's first dog,

801
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:37,789
a collie,
was named Lassie ?

802
01:01:37,831 --> 01:01:41,293
Had you heard this ?
Who's Ted Bundy ?

803
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:45,588
Forget it.

804
01:01:45,671 --> 01:01:48,299
What's that ?

805
01:01:48,382 --> 01:01:53,344
Duct tape. I need it for, uh,
taping something.

806
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,101
Patrick,

807
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:03,979
have you ever wanted to...
make someone happy ?

808
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:06,440
What ? No !
Put it in the carton.

809
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:11,152
Sorry.

810
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:12,945
Jean ?

811
01:02:14,906 --> 01:02:19,493
What ?
Uh, make someone happy ?

812
01:02:20,827 --> 01:02:23,205
Have you ever wanted to ?

813
01:02:25,539 --> 01:02:28,042
I'm looking for, uh,

814
01:02:31,879 --> 01:02:35,131
I guess you could say I just wanna have
a meaningful relationship...

815
01:02:35,215 --> 01:02:39,052
with someone special.
Hmm.

816
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:50,061
Patrick ? Patrick ?
I know you're there.

817
01:02:50,144 --> 01:02:52,355
Pick up the phone,
you badboy.

818
01:02:52,396 --> 01:02:56,526
What are you up to tonight ?
It's me. Don't try to hide.

819
01:02:56,567 --> 01:03:00,779
I hope you're not with some little number
you picked up because you're my Mr. Bateman.

820
01:03:00,862 --> 01:03:03,490
My boy next door.

821
01:03:03,573 --> 01:03:05,992
Anyway, you never called me
and you said you would,

822
01:03:06,076 --> 01:03:08,577
and I'll leave a message for Jean
about this, too, to remind you,

823
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:11,038
but we're having dinner
with Melania and Taylor.

824
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,374
You know Me lania.
She went to Sweet Briar.

825
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:15,708
And we're meeting
at the Cornell Club,

826
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,752
so I'll call you
tomorrowmorning, honey.

827
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:20,213
Oops. Sorry.
I know you hate that.

828
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:25,759
Bye, Patrick.
Bye, Mr. Big Time C.E.O. Bye-bye.

829
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:32,056
Was that Evelyn ?

830
01:03:34,934 --> 01:03:37,353
Are you still seeing her?

831
01:03:41,481 --> 01:03:44,734
I'm sorry.
I have no right to ask that.

832
01:03:49,613 --> 01:03:52,074
Do you want me to go ?

833
01:03:52,158 --> 01:03:54,076
Yeah.

834
01:03:56,119 --> 01:03:58,872
I don't think
I can control myself.

835
01:04:01,082 --> 01:04:05,878
I know. I should go. I know I have
a tendency to get involved with unavailable men.

836
01:04:08,422 --> 01:04:10,340
I mean,

837
01:04:11,633 --> 01:04:14,343
do you want me to go ?

838
01:04:14,427 --> 01:04:17,388
I think if you stay,

839
01:04:17,472 --> 01:04:20,140
something bad will happen.

840
01:04:21,475 --> 01:04:23,393
I think I might hurt you.

841
01:04:24,853 --> 01:04:27,230
You don't wanna get hurt,
do you ?

842
01:04:27,314 --> 01:04:29,607
No. No, I guess not.

843
01:04:30,941 --> 01:04:33,611
I don't wanna get bruised.

844
01:04:35,488 --> 01:04:38,490
You're right.
I should go.

845
01:04:44,162 --> 01:04:49,083
Oh. Don't forget you have a lunch date
tomorrow with Donald Kimball at Smith and Wolenski's.

846
01:04:50,167 --> 01:04:52,503
Thanks.

847
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:54,879
It slipped my mind completely.

848
01:05:13,938 --> 01:05:17,941
So, the night
he disappeared--

849
01:05:18,024 --> 01:05:20,777
any new thoughts
about what you did ?

850
01:05:22,737 --> 01:05:26,198
Not sure.
Um, I had a shower...

851
01:05:26,281 --> 01:05:28,200
and some sorbet ?

852
01:05:28,283 --> 01:05:30,327
I think you're getting
your dates mixed up.

853
01:05:30,411 --> 01:05:32,329
But how ?

854
01:05:32,413 --> 01:05:35,456
Where do you place...
Paul that night ?

855
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:39,043
According to his date book, and
this was verified by his secretary,

856
01:05:39,127 --> 01:05:42,046
he had dinner
with Marcus Halberstram.

857
01:05:42,129 --> 01:05:44,339
And ?
I questioned him.

858
01:05:44,423 --> 01:05:48,677
- Marcus ? - Yes, and he denies it, though,
at first, he couldn't be sure.

859
01:05:48,718 --> 01:05:51,679
But he denied it.
Yes.

860
01:05:52,888 --> 01:05:54,974
Well, does Marcus
have an alibi ?

861
01:05:55,057 --> 01:05:58,518
Yes.
He does ? You'resure ?

862
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:00,520
I checked it out.
It's clean.

863
01:06:04,649 --> 01:06:08,068
Now, where were you ?

864
01:06:08,152 --> 01:06:10,237
Where was Marcus ?

865
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,489
He wasn't with Paul Allen.

866
01:06:12,573 --> 01:06:14,700
Who was he with ?
He was...

867
01:06:14,783 --> 01:06:17,243
at Atlantis... with...

868
01:06:17,326 --> 01:06:21,372
Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,
Harry Newman, George Butner...

869
01:06:21,456 --> 01:06:23,999
and... you.

870
01:06:28,211 --> 01:06:30,130
Oh, right, yeah.
Of course.

871
01:06:30,213 --> 01:06:34,383
We had wanted
Paul Allen to come,

872
01:06:34,425 --> 01:06:36,635
but he had made plans.

873
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:40,680
And I guess I had dinner with
Victoria the following night.

874
01:06:40,764 --> 01:06:43,141
Personally, I think the guy
went a little nutso.

875
01:06:43,224 --> 01:06:48,103
Split town for a while. Maybe he did go
to London, sightseeing, drinking, whatever.

876
01:06:48,187 --> 01:06:52,399
Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn
up sooner or later. I mean, to think...

877
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:57,737
that one of his friends killed him for no
reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous.

878
01:06:57,779 --> 01:07:00,073
Isn't that right, Patrick ?

879
01:07:20,924 --> 01:07:23,385
Christie. Christie.

880
01:07:23,468 --> 01:07:27,222
I'm not so sure about this.
I had to go to Emergency after last time.

881
01:07:27,305 --> 01:07:30,057
This won't be anything
like last time. I promise.

882
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:32,935
I don't think so.

883
01:07:32,976 --> 01:07:36,271
Just come in the limo
and talk to me for a minute.

884
01:07:36,313 --> 01:07:38,272
The driver's here.
You'll be safe.

885
01:07:57,123 --> 01:07:59,500
Nothing like last time.
Promise.

886
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:01,501
All right.

887
01:08:01,584 --> 01:08:04,879
So, you're looking great.
How have you been ?

888
01:08:04,963 --> 01:08:08,800
Well, I actually might need surgery
after last time. Really ?

889
01:08:08,842 --> 01:08:12,970
My friend told me I should maybe
even get a lawyer.

890
01:08:13,011 --> 01:08:15,723
Lawyers are so complicated.

891
01:08:15,806 --> 01:08:18,349
Don't do that.

892
01:08:18,433 --> 01:08:20,351
Here's a check.

893
01:09:08,101 --> 01:09:11,938
Uh-uh. Half now,
half later.

894
01:09:17,193 --> 01:09:20,696
Okay, your name is Christie.

895
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:23,407
We're meeting a friend
of mine, Elizabeth.

896
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:27,911
She'll bejoining us
in my new apartment shortly.

897
01:09:27,994 --> 01:09:31,414
You'll like her.
She's a very nice girl.

898
01:09:37,503 --> 01:09:41,130
You look really familiar.
Did you go to Dalton ?

899
01:09:43,549 --> 01:09:46,260
I think I met you at Surf Bar, didn't I ?
With Spicey ?

900
01:09:46,344 --> 01:09:49,554
Well, maybe not with Spicey, but
definitely at SurfBar. You know, SurfBar.

901
01:09:49,596 --> 01:09:51,765
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now.
It's terrible.

902
01:09:51,848 --> 01:09:57,019
Went to a birthday party there
for Malcolm Forbes. Oh, my God, please.

903
01:09:57,103 --> 01:09:59,647
This is nicer
than your other apartment.

904
01:10:01,816 --> 01:10:03,943
Oh, it's not
that nice.

905
01:10:08,613 --> 01:10:12,283
Where did you two meet ?
Oh, God. We met at...

906
01:10:12,367 --> 01:10:16,787
oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby
in '85, or '86.

907
01:10:16,829 --> 01:10:20,165
You were hanging out with that
bimbo Allison Poole. Hot number.

908
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:22,500
What do you mean ?
She was a hot number.

909
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:27,171
If you had a platinum card, she'd give you
a blowjob. This girl worked in a tanning salon.

910
01:10:27,255 --> 01:10:29,798
What do you do ?

911
01:10:29,881 --> 01:10:33,802
She's my... cousin.

912
01:10:33,885 --> 01:10:37,805
Uh-huh.
She's from... France.

913
01:10:37,847 --> 01:10:41,225
Where's your phone ?
I've gotta call Harley.

914
01:10:44,687 --> 01:10:48,398
Where do you summer,
South Hampton ?

915
01:10:49,566 --> 01:10:52,736
- No.
- Oh, God, it's his machine.

916
01:10:52,819 --> 01:10:56,822
It's 3:00 in the morning. He's a goddamn
drug dealer. These are his peak hours.

917
01:10:56,905 --> 01:10:58,991
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I ?

918
01:10:59,074 --> 01:11:00,993
This tastes weird.

919
01:11:01,076 --> 01:11:05,329
Harley, it's me. I need your services.
Translate that howeveryou want.

920
01:11:05,413 --> 01:11:09,167
- I'm at--
- Paul Allen's.

921
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:11,543
Who ?
Paul Allen's.

922
01:11:11,626 --> 01:11:15,547
I want the number, idiot. Anyway, I'm at
Paul Norman's and I'll try you again later.

923
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:19,383
And if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow
night I'm gonna sic my hairdresser on you.

924
01:11:19,467 --> 01:11:21,385
Did you know that guy
who disappeared ?

925
01:11:21,469 --> 01:11:24,347
Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce ?
Was he a friend of yours ?

926
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:26,349
No.

927
01:11:26,431 --> 01:11:29,309
Do you have any coke ?
Or Halcyon ?

928
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:32,395
I would take a Halcyon.
Listen.

929
01:11:34,105 --> 01:11:36,231
I would just like to see...

930
01:11:36,315 --> 01:11:38,817
the two of you...
get it on.

931
01:11:38,859 --> 01:11:42,071
What's wrong with that ?

932
01:11:42,154 --> 01:11:44,405
It's totally disease free.

933
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,327
Patrick, you're a lunatic.
Come on.

934
01:11:49,369 --> 01:11:51,703
Don't you find Christie
attractive ?

935
01:11:51,745 --> 01:11:55,540
Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood
for a lewd conversation.

936
01:11:55,582 --> 01:11:57,918
Come on.

937
01:11:58,001 --> 01:12:01,420
I think it'd be a turn-on.
Does he do this all the time ?

938
01:12:04,215 --> 01:12:06,884
Christie,
you're not drinking your wine.

939
01:12:08,385 --> 01:12:10,804
Are you telling me you've never
gotten it on with a girl?

940
01:12:10,887 --> 01:12:14,015
No. I'm not a lesbian.

941
01:12:14,057 --> 01:12:16,934
Why would you think
I would be into that ?

942
01:12:17,017 --> 01:12:19,186
Well, you went to
Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

943
01:12:19,269 --> 01:12:23,856
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.
You're making me feel weird.

944
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:30,405
Did you know...

945
01:12:30,488 --> 01:12:33,949
that Whitney Houston's
debut LP...

946
01:12:34,032 --> 01:12:37,035
called simply
Whitney Houston...

947
01:12:37,077 --> 01:12:39,913
had four number-one
singles on it ?

948
01:12:41,372 --> 01:12:43,499
Did you know that,
Christie ?

949
01:12:43,582 --> 01:12:47,003
You actually listen
to Whitney Houston ?

950
01:12:47,086 --> 01:12:49,879
You own
a Whitney Houston CD ?

951
01:12:51,214 --> 01:12:54,467
More than one ?

952
01:12:54,551 --> 01:12:58,012
It's hard to choose a favorite among
so many great tracks.

953
01:13:00,097 --> 01:13:04,892
But the "Greatest Love Of All"
is one of the best, most powerful songs...

954
01:13:04,934 --> 01:13:07,103
ever written...

955
01:13:07,186 --> 01:13:09,105
about self-preservation...

956
01:13:09,188 --> 01:13:11,399
and dignity.

957
01:13:11,441 --> 01:13:15,068
It's universal message
crosses all boundaries...

958
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:17,320
and instills one...

959
01:13:17,404 --> 01:13:21,033
with the hope
that it's not too late...

960
01:13:21,116 --> 01:13:23,451
to better ourselves.

961
01:13:23,492 --> 01:13:26,871
Since, Elizabeth,

962
01:13:26,954 --> 01:13:31,916
it's impossible in this world we
live in to empathize with others,

963
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:35,545
we can always empathize
with ourselves.

964
01:13:35,628 --> 01:13:39,923
It's an important message.
Crucial, really.

965
01:13:42,801 --> 01:13:45,721
And it's beautifully stated
on the album.

966
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:58,034
- Not the face !

967
01:14:58,118 --> 01:15:02,162
You bitch, not the fucking face,
you piece of bitch trash !

968
01:16:30,782 --> 01:16:33,451
I want a firm commitment.

969
01:16:33,534 --> 01:16:37,163
I think, um, Evelyn,
that, uh, we've lost touch.

970
01:16:37,246 --> 01:16:39,164
Why ? What's wrong ?

971
01:16:42,626 --> 01:16:44,670
My need to engage
in homicidal behavior...

972
01:16:44,753 --> 01:16:47,546
on a massive scale
cannot be corrected,

973
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:50,633
but I have no other way
to fulfill my needs.

974
01:16:52,134 --> 01:16:55,053
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick ?

975
01:16:55,136 --> 01:16:57,138
It's over, Evelyn.

976
01:16:57,222 --> 01:16:59,724
It's all over.

977
01:16:59,808 --> 01:17:03,102
Touchy, touchy.
I'm sorry I brought up the wedding.

978
01:17:03,143 --> 01:17:06,647
Let's just avoid the issue,
all right ? Now, are we having coffee ?

979
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:11,567
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over, us.
This is no joke.

980
01:17:11,651 --> 01:17:14,529
Uh, I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

981
01:17:14,612 --> 01:17:19,866
But your friends are my friends
and my friends are your friends.

982
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:23,245
I really don't think it would work.
You have a little something--

983
01:17:23,328 --> 01:17:28,666
I know that your friends are my friends,
and, uh-- and I've thought about that.

984
01:17:28,749 --> 01:17:31,794
You can have 'em.

985
01:17:31,877 --> 01:17:35,338
You're really serious,
aren't you ? Yes, lam.

986
01:17:38,508 --> 01:17:42,679
- What about the past ? Our past ?
- We never really shared one.

987
01:17:42,762 --> 01:17:44,805
You're inhuman.
No.

988
01:17:44,888 --> 01:17:48,017
I'm in touch with humanity.

989
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:52,520
Evelyn, I'm, uh, sorry.
I just, uh--

990
01:17:52,603 --> 01:17:54,647
You're not terribly
important to me.

991
01:17:54,731 --> 01:17:57,400
Oh, no !

992
01:17:57,483 --> 01:17:59,736
No. No, Patrick.

993
01:17:59,819 --> 01:18:04,364
I know my behavior can be...
erratic sometimes.

994
01:18:05,741 --> 01:18:08,826
What do you want me to do ?
What is it that you want ?

995
01:18:08,909 --> 01:18:12,246
If you really wanna do something for me,
then stop making this scene right now.

996
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:15,249
Oh, God, I can't believe this.

997
01:18:15,333 --> 01:18:17,834
I'm leaving. I've assessed the
situation, and I'm going.

998
01:18:17,876 --> 01:18:21,212
Where are you going ?
I'm just leaving.

999
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:23,423
But where ?

1000
01:18:24,506 --> 01:18:26,759
I have to return
some videotapes.

1001
01:18:57,577 --> 01:18:59,412
Here, kitty, kitty.

1002
01:19:15,718 --> 01:19:17,845
Oh, my God.
What are you doing ?

1003
01:19:17,929 --> 01:19:19,931
Stop that.

1004
01:20:01,676 --> 01:20:04,094
Drop the weapon !
Drop it now !

1005
01:20:04,136 --> 01:20:06,179
Get on the ground!
Put your--

1006
01:20:49,301 --> 01:20:51,720
Burning the midnight oil,
Mr. Smith ?

1007
01:20:51,803 --> 01:20:54,180
Hey, now don't forget
to sign in.

1008
01:22:23,216 --> 01:22:26,386
Howard, it's Bateman.
Patrick Bateman.

1009
01:22:26,469 --> 01:22:29,472
You're my lawyer, so I think you should
know I've killed a lot of people.

1010
01:22:29,556 --> 01:22:32,349
Some escort girls
in an apartment uptown,

1011
01:22:32,433 --> 01:22:35,644
uh, some homeless people,
maybe five or ten,

1012
01:22:35,728 --> 01:22:38,105
an N.Y.U. girl I met
in Central Park.

1013
01:22:38,188 --> 01:22:40,440
I left her at a parking lot
behind some doughnut shop.

1014
01:22:40,523 --> 01:22:43,693
I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend,
with a nail gun.

1015
01:22:43,776 --> 01:22:48,238
And-And-And then some man,
s-s-some old faggot with a dog.

1016
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,490
Last week, I, uh--

1017
01:22:50,574 --> 01:22:54,077
I killed another girl
with a chain saw.

1018
01:22:56,871 --> 01:23:00,124
I had to.
She almost got away.

1019
01:23:00,207 --> 01:23:02,126
And--

1020
01:23:02,209 --> 01:23:07,339
Someone else there. I can't remember,
maybe a model-- She's dead too.

1021
01:23:07,422 --> 01:23:09,966
And, uh, Paul Allen.

1022
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:13,886
I killed Paul Allen
with an ax in the face.

1023
01:23:13,969 --> 01:23:18,390
His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen.

1024
01:23:18,474 --> 01:23:23,102
I don't wanna leave anything out here.
I guess I've killed maybe... 20 people.

1025
01:23:23,144 --> 01:23:26,272
Maybe 40 !

1026
01:23:26,314 --> 01:23:29,691
I have tapes of a lot of it.

1027
01:23:29,775 --> 01:23:32,402
Some of the girls
have seen the tapes.

1028
01:23:32,486 --> 01:23:35,155
I even, um,

1029
01:23:42,203 --> 01:23:44,704
I ate some
of their brains...

1030
01:23:44,788 --> 01:23:48,541
and I tried to
cook a little.

1031
01:23:50,919 --> 01:23:54,129
Tonight, I, uh--

1032
01:23:54,213 --> 01:23:58,175
I just had to kill
a lot of people !

1033
01:23:58,217 --> 01:24:00,386
And, um,

1034
01:24:03,429 --> 01:24:08,559
I'm not sure I'm gonna
get away with it... this time.

1035
01:24:11,395 --> 01:24:14,439
So, uh-- I mean,

1036
01:24:14,523 --> 01:24:17,984
I guess...

1037
01:24:18,025 --> 01:24:20,695
I'm a pretty, uh--

1038
01:24:21,779 --> 01:24:24,782
I mean, I guess
I'm a pretty sick guy.

1039
01:24:24,865 --> 01:24:27,450
So,

1040
01:24:29,035 --> 01:24:31,955
if you get back tomorrow,

1041
01:24:32,038 --> 01:24:34,290
I may show up at Harry's Bar.

1042
01:24:34,373 --> 01:24:37,459
So, you know,

1043
01:24:37,543 --> 01:24:39,753
keep your eyes open.

1044
01:24:39,837 --> 01:24:42,922
Okay.

1045
01:24:46,968 --> 01:24:48,886
Oh !

1046
01:26:59,126 --> 01:27:01,460
Are you my 2:00 ?

1047
01:27:01,544 --> 01:27:05,464
No.
Can I help you ?

1048
01:27:06,632 --> 01:27:10,719
I'm looking for...
Paul Allen's place.

1049
01:27:11,845 --> 01:27:15,640
Doesn't he... live here ?
No, he doesn't.

1050
01:27:15,724 --> 01:27:18,642
You sure ?

1051
01:27:18,726 --> 01:27:21,061
You saw the ad
in the Times ?

1052
01:27:21,145 --> 01:27:24,106
No. Yeah.
I mean, yeah.

1053
01:27:24,148 --> 01:27:27,734
ln the Times. There was no ad
in the Times.

1054
01:27:28,985 --> 01:27:31,279
I think you should
go now.

1055
01:27:31,321 --> 01:27:33,281
But I think--

1056
01:27:34,907 --> 01:27:37,117
I wanna know
what happened here.

1057
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:40,454
Don't make any trouble,
please.

1058
01:27:40,537 --> 01:27:42,788
I suggest you go.

1059
01:27:54,591 --> 01:27:56,509
Don't come back.

1060
01:27:56,593 --> 01:27:58,761
I won't.

1061
01:27:58,844 --> 01:28:00,930
Don't worry.

1062
01:28:27,954 --> 01:28:32,123
Patrick Bateman's office.

1063
01:28:32,207 --> 01:28:35,919
Jean ? I need help.
Patrick, is that you ?

1064
01:28:36,962 --> 01:28:39,547
Jean, I'm not--

1065
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:44,134
Craig McDermott called. Wants to meet you,
David Van Patten and Tim Bryce at Harry's.

1066
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:48,096
Oh, God. What did you say,
you dumb bitch ?

1067
01:28:48,179 --> 01:28:52,058
Patrick, I can't hear you.
What am I doing ?

1068
01:28:52,141 --> 01:28:54,102
Where are you, Patrick ?
What's wrong ?

1069
01:28:56,228 --> 01:29:00,941
I don't think I'm gonna make it,Jean,
to the, uh,

1070
01:29:01,024 --> 01:29:02,943
office this afternoon.

1071
01:29:03,026 --> 01:29:04,944
Why ?

1072
01:29:05,027 --> 01:29:09,740
Just say no ! What is it, Patrick ?
Are you all right ?

1073
01:29:09,824 --> 01:29:13,994
Stop sounding
so fucking sad.

1074
01:29:14,077 --> 01:29:15,996
Jesus !

1075
01:30:33,231 --> 01:30:37,651
That's a table for three. Bateman,
you're looking wild-eyed. Rough day ?

1076
01:30:37,734 --> 01:30:40,654
Hey, look. Bryce is back and
he's drinking mineral water.

1077
01:30:40,737 --> 01:30:43,822
He's a changed man, except for he still
can't a reservation to save his life.

1078
01:30:43,906 --> 01:30:46,075
Why don't you just try
150 Wooster?

1079
01:30:46,158 --> 01:30:49,662
I'm not going anywhere
unless we have a reservation.

1080
01:30:49,745 --> 01:30:53,540
Le Cirque, Flamingo East, OysterBar.
Come on, faggots. Let's get a "res."

1081
01:30:53,623 --> 01:30:57,377
Keep your shirt on.
Maybe lose the suspenders.

1082
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:59,461
Need a reservation
for 8:30.

1083
01:30:59,545 --> 01:31:02,089
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Right back.

1084
01:31:02,172 --> 01:31:04,591
10:00 would not be
any good. No.

1085
01:31:04,675 --> 01:31:08,010
Just fucking call them. Give me the phone.
I'll do it. I'll call you back.

1086
01:31:08,052 --> 01:31:11,472
Face it. The Japanese will own most
of this country by the end of the '90s.

1087
01:31:11,514 --> 01:31:14,517
Shut up, Carnes.
They will not.

1088
01:31:15,976 --> 01:31:19,646
So, uh, Harold,
did you get my message ?

1089
01:31:19,729 --> 01:31:23,941
Jesus, yes. That was hilarious.
That was you, wasn't it ?

1090
01:31:24,024 --> 01:31:27,778
Yeah, naturally. Bateman killing Allen
and the escort girls.

1091
01:31:27,862 --> 01:31:29,780
That's fabulous. That's rich.
What exactly do you mean ?

1092
01:31:29,864 --> 01:31:34,284
The message you left. By the way, Davis,
how's Cynthia ? You're still seeing her, right ?

1093
01:31:34,367 --> 01:31:36,452
W-Wait, Harold.
What do you mean ?

1094
01:31:36,536 --> 01:31:40,122
Excuse me. Nothing.
It's good to see you.

1095
01:31:40,205 --> 01:31:42,749
Is that Edward Towers ?

1096
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:44,751
Carnes, wait. Uh--

1097
01:31:44,835 --> 01:31:50,590
Davis, I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone.
Your joke was amusing.

1098
01:31:50,673 --> 01:31:54,594
But come on, man.
You had one fatal flaw:

1099
01:31:54,677 --> 01:31:56,761
Bateman is such a dork.

1100
01:31:56,845 --> 01:32:00,473
Such a boring,
spineless lightweight.

1101
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:04,393
Now, if you said Bryce or Mc Dermott.
Otherwise, it was amusing.

1102
01:32:04,476 --> 01:32:07,062
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really must be going.

1103
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:10,649
Wait. Uh-- Stop.

1104
01:32:11,942 --> 01:32:14,527
I did it, Carnes.

1105
01:32:14,611 --> 01:32:16,571
I killed him.

1106
01:32:16,613 --> 01:32:19,199
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1107
01:32:22,409 --> 01:32:24,661
I chopped Allen's
fucking head off.

1108
01:32:25,913 --> 01:32:30,917
The whole message
I left on your machine was true.

1109
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,836
Excuse me.
I really must be going now.

1110
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,089
No. No, listen.

1111
01:32:37,172 --> 01:32:39,674
Don't you know who I am ?

1112
01:32:39,758 --> 01:32:42,510
I'm not Davis.
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1113
01:32:45,222 --> 01:32:48,474
We talk on the phone
all the time.

1114
01:32:48,516 --> 01:32:51,143
Don't you recognize me ?

1115
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:55,355
You're my lawyer.

1116
01:32:55,438 --> 01:33:00,026
Now, Carnes, listen.

1117
01:33:00,109 --> 01:33:02,361
Listen very, very carefully.

1118
01:33:06,073 --> 01:33:09,409
I killed Paul Allen,

1119
01:33:09,493 --> 01:33:11,494
and I liked it.

1120
01:33:11,536 --> 01:33:15,373
I can't make myself
any clearer.

1121
01:33:15,414 --> 01:33:19,543
But that's simply not possible.
And I don't find this funny anymore.

1122
01:33:19,626 --> 01:33:23,171
It never was supposed to be.
Why isn't it possible ?

1123
01:33:23,213 --> 01:33:27,508
It's just not.
Why not, you stupid bastard ?

1124
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:29,844
Because I had dinner
with Paul Allen...

1125
01:33:29,885 --> 01:33:32,471
twice in London
just ten days ago.

1126
01:33:32,555 --> 01:33:34,639
No, you...

1127
01:33:37,392 --> 01:33:40,228
didn't.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1128
01:34:21,431 --> 01:34:23,765
We've seen the results
of that mistrust...

1129
01:34:23,807 --> 01:34:27,352
in the form of lies,
provisions in the states.

1130
01:34:27,436 --> 01:34:31,898
We need to find a way to cooperate while
realizing foreign policy...

1131
01:34:31,939 --> 01:34:34,358
can't be run
by committee.

1132
01:34:34,442 --> 01:34:36,903
And I believe there's now
the growing sense...

1133
01:34:36,986 --> 01:34:40,906
that we can accomplish more
by cooperating.

1134
01:34:40,947 --> 01:34:44,910
And in the end, this maybe the eventual
blessing in disguise...

1135
01:34:44,993 --> 01:34:46,995
to come out of
the Iran-Contra mess.

1136
01:34:47,078 --> 01:34:50,706
How can he lie like that ?

1137
01:34:50,789 --> 01:34:52,750
How can he pull that shit ?
What shit ?

1138
01:34:52,791 --> 01:34:54,919
Now, where do we have
reservations at ?

1139
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,962
I'm not really hungry, but I'd like
to have reservations someplace.

1140
01:34:58,046 --> 01:35:00,965
How can you be so fucking,

1141
01:35:01,049 --> 01:35:03,551
I don't know,
cool about it ?

1142
01:35:03,635 --> 01:35:07,095
Some guys arejust
born cool, I guess.

1143
01:35:11,808 --> 01:35:13,976
Bateman ?

1144
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:19,315
- What are you so fucking zany about ?
- I'm just a happy camper.

1145
01:35:19,398 --> 01:35:21,858
Rockin' and a rollin' !

1146
01:35:21,942 --> 01:35:23,985
Oh, brother, look.

1147
01:35:24,069 --> 01:35:29,115
He presents himself as this harmless
old codger, but inside--

1148
01:35:29,157 --> 01:35:31,784
but inside--

1149
01:35:31,867 --> 01:35:34,787
But inside doesn't matter.

1150
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:39,165
Inside ? Believe or not, Bryce,
we're actually listening to you.

1151
01:35:39,249 --> 01:35:41,835
Come on, Bateman.
What do you think ?

1152
01:35:44,754 --> 01:35:49,049
- Whatever.
- Whose moronic idea was it to order dry beers ?

1153
01:35:49,132 --> 01:35:51,134
I need a scotch.

1154
01:36:07,315 --> 01:36:10,359
There are no more barriers
to cross.

1155
01:36:10,442 --> 01:36:14,280
All I have in common with the
uncontrollable and the insane,

1156
01:36:14,363 --> 01:36:17,700
the vicious and the evil,
all the mayhem I have caused...

1157
01:36:17,741 --> 01:36:19,826
and my utter indifference
toward it,

1158
01:36:19,909 --> 01:36:22,495
I have now surpassed.

1159
01:36:25,165 --> 01:36:28,083
My pain is constant and sharp...

1160
01:36:28,167 --> 01:36:31,795
and I do not hope
for a better world for anyone.

1161
01:36:31,879 --> 01:36:36,382
In fact, I want my pain
to be inflicted on others.

1162
01:36:36,465 --> 01:36:39,051
I want no one to escape.

1163
01:36:40,178 --> 01:36:43,055
But even after admitting this,

1164
01:36:43,138 --> 01:36:45,307
there is no catharsis.

1165
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:48,143
My punishment continues
to elude me...

1166
01:36:48,226 --> 01:36:51,437
and I gain no deeper knowledge
of myself.

1167
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:55,274
No new knowledge can be
extracted from my telling.

1168
01:36:55,357 --> 01:36:59,527
This confession
has meant... nothing.
