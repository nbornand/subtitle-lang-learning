3
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:21,168
You know there are more people
with genius IQ living in China

4
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:23,293
than they're people of any
kind living in United States.

5
00:00:23,328 --> 00:00:24,404
That can't be possible be true.

6
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:25,256
That is.

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,075
What would account for that?

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,567
First, awful lot people living in China.

9
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:29,106
But, here's my question.

10
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:30,842
How do you distinguish yourself than

11
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:32,992
population of people who
all got 1600 under SAT's?

12
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:35,325
- I didn't know they take SAT's in China.
- They don't.

13
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,509
I wasn't talkin' about China anymore.
I was talkin' about me.

14
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:38,795
You got 1600?

15
00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:41,004
Yes. I can sing in a Capella group,
but I can't sing.

16
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:42,320
Does that mean you
actually got nothing wrong?

17
00:00:42,321 --> 00:00:44,571
I could row crew or invent a 25 dollar PC.

18
00:00:44,606 --> 00:00:47,219
- Or you get into the "Final Club"?
- Or I get into the "Final Club".

19
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:48,775
You know, from women perspective...

20
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,069
Sometimes, not singing in an
a Capella group is a good thing.

21
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:51,953
This is serious.

22
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:53,497
On the other hand,
I do like a row crew.

23
00:00:53,532 --> 00:00:55,690
Well, I can't do that.

24
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:56,853
I was kidding.

25
00:00:56,888 --> 00:00:58,186
Yes, I got nothing wrong in test.

26
00:00:58,221 --> 00:00:59,381
Have you ever tried?

27
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,507
I'm trying right now.

28
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:01,233
To row crew?

29
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:04,338
Gettin' into "Final Club". To row crew? No!
Are you like... whatever, delusional?

30
00:01:04,573 --> 00:01:06,643
Maybe, sometimes you said 2 things at once,

31
00:01:06,644 --> 00:01:08,436
I'm not sure which one I
suppose to be aiming at...

32
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:10,120
But you seen guys who row crew, right?

33
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:11,473
No.

34
00:01:11,508 --> 00:01:13,330
Ok, well, they bigger than me.
They world class athlete.

35
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,378
Like a second ago you said
you like guys who row crew.

36
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:16,121
So I assumed you've met one.

37
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,535
I guess, I just meant like the idea of it,
you know the way a girl likes cowboys.

38
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:21,540
Ok.

39
00:01:22,446 --> 00:01:23,511
Should we get something to eat?

40
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:24,809
Would you like to talk about something else?

41
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:28,770
No, it just that since the beginning of
the conversation about the "Finals Club"

42
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:30,702
I think I may have miss a birthday.

43
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:34,521
There are really more people in
China with genius IQ's than entire...

44
00:01:34,556 --> 00:01:38,007
"Phoenix" is the most diverse.
The "Fry Club", Roosevelt punched the porc.

45
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:38,769
Which one?

46
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:40,774
"The Porcellian, the Porc,
it's the best of the best"

47
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,780
Which Roosevelt?

48
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:43,026
Theodore

49
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:46,089
Is it true they send a bus
around to pick up the girls?

50
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,091
Who wanna party with next phoenix chairman.

51
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:50,244
So you can see why it's
so important to get in.

52
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:52,024
Well, which is the easiest to get into?

53
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,861
Why would you ask me that?

54
00:01:55,896 --> 00:01:57,168
I was just asking.

55
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:59,248
None of them.
That's the point.

56
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:02,769
My friend, Eduardo made $300.000
betting oil futures one summer.

57
00:02:02,804 --> 00:02:06,256
And Eduardo won't comes close to get in. The ability
to make money doesn't impress anybody around here.

58
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,470
Must be nice.
He made $300.000 in a summer.

59
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:10,608
He likes meteorology.

60
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:12,118
You said it was oil futures.

61
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:13,932
You can read the weather, you can
predict the price of heating oil.

62
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,119
I think you ask me that because you think
the "Final Club" that's easiest to get into

63
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:19,068
Is the one, where I'll have the best chance...

64
00:02:19,103 --> 00:02:20,757
What?

65
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,429
You ask me which one is the easiest to get into

66
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:24,860
Because you think that the one,
where I have the best chance.

67
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,086
The one that the easiest is to get into,

68
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,098
Would be the one where
anybody has the best chance.

69
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,886
You didn't ask me which
one was the best one.

70
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:32,562
You ask me which one was the easiest one.

71
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:34,173
I was honestly just asking, ok...

72
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:38,041
I was just asking to ask...
Mark, I'm not speaking in code.

73
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:38,796
Erika,

74
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:40,517
You obsesses with "Finals Clubs"

75
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:42,449
You have "Finals Clubs"- OCD

76
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:43,850
You need to see someone about it.

77
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:45,182
who'll prescribe you some sort of medication

78
00:02:45,217 --> 00:02:47,419
You don't care if the side
effect may include blindness.

79
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:51,006
"Final Clubs" not "Finals Clubs"

80
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,021
And there's a difference between
being obsessed than being motivated.

81
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:56,682
Yes, there is.

82
00:02:56,683 --> 00:02:59,084
Well, you do that, it's was cryptic,
so you do speaking code.

83
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:00,178
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

84
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,776
I'm just saying I need to do something substantial
in order to get the attention of the club.

85
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:04,352
Why?

86
00:03:04,387 --> 00:03:06,948
Because they're exclusive and fun.

87
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:08,246
And they lead to the better life.

88
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:10,248
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get
elected for the president

89
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:11,698
because he was member from "Phoenix" Club?

90
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,947
He was a member of The
Porcellian, and yes he did.

91
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:18,370
Why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you, you can be.

92
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:19,350
Did you really just said that?

93
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:20,296
I was kidding.

94
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,616
I wanna try to be straight forward

95
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:26,412
You might wanna be a little more supportive.

96
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:28,707
If I get in I will be taking you to the events

97
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,976
and the gatherings and will be meeting a
lot of people you won't normally get to meet.

98
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:35,776
You would do that for me?

99
00:03:35,811 --> 00:03:38,195
We're dating.

100
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:44,206
Ok, well I wanna try and be straight forward
even let you know that we're not anymore.

101
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:44,906
What you mean?

102
00:03:45,352 --> 00:03:47,063
We're not dating anymore.
I'm sorry.

103
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:47,850
This is a joke?

104
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:48,927
No, it's not.

105
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,255
You're breaking up with me?

106
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,340
You gonna introduce me the people I
wouldn't normally have the chance to meet.

107
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,428
What the f...

108
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:56,215
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Wait, settle down.

109
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:56,973
What is it supposed to mean?

110
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:58,497
Erica, the reason we're able
to sit and drink right now,

111
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,296
because you used to
sleep with the door guy.

112
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:03,380
"The door guy" his name is Bobby.

113
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,331
I have not slept with "the door guy".

114
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:06,813
"The door guy" is a friend of mine.

115
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:09,249
And he's the perfectly good class of people.

116
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:12,252
And what part of Long Island you from?
Wimbledon?

117
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,156
- Wait
- I'm going back to my dormy.

118
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:15,705
- Wait, wait is this real?
- Yes.

119
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,977
Ok, than wait, I apologize, ok...

120
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:18,214
- I have to go study.
- Erika...

121
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:20,396
- Yes?
- I'm sorry, I meant it.

122
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:22,257
I appreciate that but
I have to go study.

123
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:23,009
Come on.
You don't have to study.

124
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:24,195
You don't have to study.
Let just talk.

125
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,318
- I can't
- Why?

126
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:28,234
Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a stairmaster.

127
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,426
All I meant is that you not likely to...

128
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:32,314
Currently, I wasn't making
a comment on you're parents.

129
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:33,140
I was saying that you go to B.U. *Boston University*

130
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:34,232
I was studying a fact.
That's all.

131
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,333
If it's seem rude,
than of course I've to apologize.

132
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:36,291
I have to go study.

133
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:37,214
You don't have to study.

134
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:38,273
Why you keep saying that
I don't need to study.

135
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:40,241
Because you go to B.U.

136
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,462
Wanna get some food?

137
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:47,438
I'm sorry you're not sufficiently
impressed with my educations.

138
00:04:47,473 --> 00:04:49,066
I'm sorry, I don't have a row boat.

139
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:50,800
- So we're even.
- I think we should just be friend.

140
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:51,997
I don't want friends.

141
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:54,731
I was just being polite. I have no
intention of being friends with you...

142
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:56,781
I'm under some pressure
right now from my OS class.

143
00:04:56,816 --> 00:04:58,797
If could just order some food.
I think we should...

144
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:04,616
Look, you will probably going to
be very successful computer person.

145
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:07,155
You gonna go thru life thinking
that girls don't like you,

146
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,360
Because you're a nerd...

147
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:14,524
I want you know, from the bottom
of my heart that won't be true.

148
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:18,718
It would be because you are an asshole.

149
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:48,681
<i>Harvard University, Fall 2003</i>

150
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,353
Kirkland House

151
00:08:18,942 --> 00:08:21,239
Erika Albright's a bitch

152
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:23,502
You think that's because her family
changed their name from Albrecht?

153
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:27,035
Or do you think because
all B.U. girls are bitches?

154
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,911
For the record, she may look like a 34C.

155
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,780
But she's getting all kind of help
from our friends at "Victoria's Secret"

156
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,960
She's a 34B, as in
barely anything there.

157
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:39,961
False Advertising.

158
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:47,674
The truth is she has a nice face. I need
to do something to take my mind of her.

159
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:50,720
Easy enough, except I need an idea.

160
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,077
I'm a little intoxicated.
I'm not gonna lie.

161
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:02,123
So, what if it's not even 10pm
and it's a Tuesday night?

162
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:04,173
The Kirkland's facebook
is open on my desktop

163
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:08,019
And somebody of these people with
pretty horrendous facebook pics.

164
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,220
Billy Olsen's sitting here had the idea,

165
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:11,823
putting some of the picture
next to picture of farm animal,

166
00:09:11,824 --> 00:09:13,224
and have people vote who's hotter.

167
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:14,225
Good call, Mr. Olsen!

168
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,629
Yeah, it's on.

169
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,933
I'm not gonna do the farm animal but I
like the idea of comparing two people together.

170
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:30,579
It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel since
people's rating of the picture is more implicit...

171
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:34,763
Than say, choosing a number to represent each
person's hotness like they do on hotornot. com

172
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:37,120
The first thing we're going
to need is a lot of picture

173
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:39,642
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't
keep a public centralized facebook,

174
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:43,128
So I'm going to get all the images from
the individual houses that people are in,

175
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,131
Let the hacking begin!

176
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:06,520
First up is Kirkland, they keep everything open
and allow indexes in their Apache configuration,

177
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:10,596
So a little wget magic is all that's necessary
to download the entire Kirkland facebook.

178
00:10:10,597 --> 00:10:11,797
Kid's stuff.

179
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:31,928
Next is Eliot. They're also open,
but with no indexes in Apache.

180
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:35,873
I can run an empty search and it returns all
of the images in the database in a single page.

181
00:10:35,908 --> 00:10:39,231
Then I can save the page and Mozilla will save all
the images for me. Excellent. Moving right along.

182
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:41,233
Excellent.
Moving right along.

183
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:43,184
Excuse me, everybody...

184
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:49,817
You're in one of the oldest, one of the most
exclusive club, not just Harvard but in the world.

185
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:54,516
Now, I wanna welcome you all, The Phoenix
Club First Party of the fall semester.

186
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:05,057
Lowell has some security they require
username/password combo.

187
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:07,660
I'm gonna go ahead and says the don't have an access to main fas user database

188
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:10,062
So they have no worry detecting an intrusion.

189
00:11:10,063 --> 00:11:14,138
Adams has no security but limit
the number of result to 20 of pages,

190
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:18,214
All I need to do is to break up some
script I use on Lowell and reset.

191
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,830
Quincy has no online facebook,
what a shame!

192
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:23,149
Nothing I can do about that.

193
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:27,480
Dunster is intense not only there's no public
directory but there's no directory at all.

194
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:31,349
You have to do searches. And if you're search
return more than 20 matches, nothing's get return.

195
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,696
Once you do get result, they
don't link directly to images.

196
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:35,615
They link to PHP that
redirect to something.

197
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:38,387
Weird! That's maybe difficult,
I'll come back later.

198
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:39,394
- Hei, Mark!
- What?

199
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:41,792
Great one.
Beautiful fish.

200
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,383
Leverett is a little better.
They still make you search.

201
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:47,613
But you can do an empty search and get
links to pages with every students pictures

202
00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:50,136
I slightly obnoxious that they only
let you view one picture at a time...

203
00:11:50,237 --> 00:11:53,081
There's no way I'm gonna go to 500
pages to download pics one at a time

204
00:11:53,316 --> 00:11:56,822
So it's definitely necessary to break
out emacs and modify that Perl script.

205
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:14,876
Done.

206
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:17,236
Hey, what's goin' on?

207
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,477
Perfect timing.

208
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:20,851
Eduardo is here and he is going
to have the key ingredients

209
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,484
- Hey Mark,
- Eduardo...

210
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,012
You and Erica split up?

211
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:26,009
How did you know that?

212
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,602
It's on your blog.

213
00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:29,103
Yeah.

214
00:12:29,104 --> 00:12:29,915
Are you alright?

215
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,794
- I need you.
- I'm here for you.

216
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:34,866
No, I need the algorithm you
use to rank chess players.

217
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:35,893
Are you ok?

218
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:39,168
We're ranking girls.

219
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:41,304
- You mean others student.
- Yup.

220
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,407
You think this such a good idea?

221
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:48,160
I need the algorithm, alright.
I need the algorithm.

222
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:50,061
Each girl base rating 1400.

223
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:54,727
At any given time "Girl A" has a rating
R-a and "Girl B" has a rating R-b.

224
00:12:54,762 --> 00:12:56,164
When any 2 girls are matched up,

225
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:59,766
there's an expectation of which will
win based on their current rating, right?

226
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:01,768
And all those expectations
are express this way.

227
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,770
Let's write it.

228
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:20,925
The one on the left.

229
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,191
The right.

230
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:24,591
It works.

231
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:26,730
Who should we send it first?

232
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:26,914
- Dwyer
- Neal

233
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:28,930
Who will you send it to?

234
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:33,834
Just to couple of people.
Question is: who are they gonna send it to?

235
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:06,406
Hey, guys check this out.

236
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:11,357
Right or left.

237
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:11,898
Look this hot.

238
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:18,758
She's my room mate.

239
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:23,844
This is pathetic.

240
00:14:30,673 --> 00:14:33,239
Albright?

241
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:35,434
He blog about you.

242
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:38,377
You don't wanna read it.

243
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:49,370
Erika, is this yours?

244
00:15:02,432 --> 00:15:04,705
Awful lot of traffic.

245
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,447
You think maybe we should shut
it down before get into trouble.

246
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,677
Hello?

247
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:24,049
Wa-wait... what?

248
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,826
At 4 in the morning?

249
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:28,554
Well, this very an usual amount of
traffic to the switch of Kirkland.

250
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:30,585
You're saying it's unusual
for 4 in the morning?

251
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,081
No, this should be unusual
for half time at the superbowl.

252
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:36,171
Alright.

253
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,137
I'm gonna go in.

254
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:42,390
What's goin' on?

255
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:46,001
Harvard network is about to crash.

256
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:54,240
You don't think...

257
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:56,076
I do...

258
00:15:56,111 --> 00:15:59,996
Go to see if it's everybody...

259
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:05,075
I can't comin'

260
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:08,991
The network's down.

261
00:16:09,026 --> 00:16:11,304
Unless, it's coincidence,
I think this is us.

262
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,524
It's not a coincidence.

263
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:16,365
Holy shit...

264
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:20,674
So you were called in front of the Ad Board.

265
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:21,693
That's not what happen.

266
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:23,900
You weren't called in front
of the Administrator Board?

267
00:16:23,935 --> 00:16:27,092
No, back, I mean... that's,
back at the bar with Erica Albright.

268
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:29,517
She said all that?
That I said that stuff to her.

269
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:31,465
I was reading from the
transcript for the deposition.

270
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,343
Why we do even need to depose her?

271
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:34,548
That really for us to decide.

272
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,630
Miss, You think if I know she
can make me look like a jerk.

273
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:38,281
- I'll be more likely to settle.
- Mark...

274
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:40,499
Why don't we stretch our legs for
a minute, can we do that?

275
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:41,835
It's been almost 3 hours.

276
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:44,337
And frankly you did spend
awful lot of the time...

277
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:47,034
Embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg with
the girl's testimony from the bar.

278
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:48,977
I'm not embarrassed.
She just made a lot that up.

279
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:50,305
She was under oath.

280
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,653
I guess there would be the first
time somebody's lies under oath.

281
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:06,434
You got 22 hundred hits within 2 hours?

282
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:09,985
- Thousands.
- What?

283
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,605
Twenty-two *thousands*.

284
00:17:14,606 --> 00:17:15,606
WOW...

285
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,945
These guys are pretty fast.

286
00:17:40,448 --> 00:17:43,363
Sure anybody make this a fair fight?

287
00:17:43,398 --> 00:17:45,202
Jump up and swim.

288
00:17:45,237 --> 00:17:47,615
I think we'd have to jump up and drowned.

289
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:50,570
Or you could row forward,
I could row backward.

290
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:54,129
We're genetically identical, science
says we'd stay in the one place.

291
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,216
Just row the damn boat.

292
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:05,174
- You guys here about this?
- What?

293
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:09,045
Two nights ago, a sophomore shut
the network from laptop at Kirkland.

294
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,612
- At 4AM.
- How?

295
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:14,362
He set up a website, where you vote
on the hotness female undergrads.

296
00:18:14,997 --> 00:18:16,967
What were we doing that none
of us heard about this?

297
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:20,270
I do not know, 3 hour
technical row before breakfast

298
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:22,155
Full course load, studying.

299
00:18:22,156 --> 00:18:24,098
Another 3 hours in
the tank then studying.

300
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:26,040
I'm not sure how we missed it.

301
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:27,797
How much activity was on those thing?

302
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:31,478
Twenty two thousands pages request.

303
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:33,949
This guy hack the facebook from 7 houses.

304
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:36,386
He set up the whole site in 1 night.
And he did it while he was drunk.

305
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:38,010
Twenty two thousands?

306
00:18:38,045 --> 00:18:39,175
How do you know his drunk?

307
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,804
He was blogging simultaneously,

308
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:44,732
- You know what I think?
- I'm way ahead of you

309
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:47,522
This is our guy.

310
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:53,325
Cameron Winklevoss, W-i-n-k-I-e-v-o-s-s,
Cameron spell the usual way.

311
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,036
Tyler Winklevoss, Tyler spell the usual way.
And my last name the same as my brother's.

312
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,201
Mr. Zuckerberg, This in an
Administration board hearing.

313
00:19:02,236 --> 00:19:07,017
You're being accused of intentionally
breaching security, violating copyrights,

314
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:12,893
Violating individual privacy by
creating the website www.facemash.com.

315
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:17,638
You're also charge with being in violation university
policy on distribution of digitized imaging.

316
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:22,104
Before we begin with our questioning you're allowed
to make a statement, would you like to do so?

317
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:30,079
I've, You know, I've already apologize
to the Crimson, to the ABHW...

318
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,796
To Fuerza Latina, and to any women in Harvard may
have been insulted as I take it that they were.

319
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:39,593
As for any charges stemming from
the breach from the security,

320
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,995
I believe I deserve some
recognition from this board.

321
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,636
I'm sorry?

322
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:47,106
Yes.

323
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:48,108
I don't understand...

324
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:49,571
Which part?

325
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,183
You deserve recognition?

326
00:19:52,218 --> 00:19:54,619
I believe, I pointed out some
pretty gaping holes on your system...

327
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:58,139
- Excuse me, May I?
- Yes

328
00:19:58,174 --> 00:20:02,946
Mr. Zuckerberg. I'm in charge of security
for all computer on the Harvard network.

329
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:05,444
And I can assure you of its sophistication.

330
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:09,399
In fact it was that level of sophistification
that led us to you in for less than 4 hours.

331
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:10,857
- Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

332
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:13,437
That would be impressive except if
you had know what you lookin' for,

333
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:14,983
You would've seen it written
on my dorm room window.

334
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:24,632
- So?
- Six month academic probation.

335
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,689
Well, they making an example out of you.

336
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:28,677
They have my blog.

337
00:20:28,712 --> 00:20:31,030
I shouldn't have write nothing about
the farm animals. That was stupid.

338
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:34,762
But, I was kidding, for god sake.
Doesn't anybody have some sense of humour?

339
00:20:34,797 --> 00:20:37,538
- But I tried to stop you.
- I know

340
00:20:37,573 --> 00:20:38,698
How do you do these thing,

341
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:40,780
How you manage to get
all girls to hate us.

342
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,382
- Why do I let you...
- I know.

343
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,385
- Can't do that...
- Eduardo, I said enough.

344
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:47,719
Ok, let's look at a sample problem...

345
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,536
Suppose we're given a computer with a 16-bit
virtual address and a page size of 256 bytes.

346
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:58,687
The system uses one-level page
tables, which start at address 0x400.

347
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:02,572
Maybe you want to have DMA on
your 16-bit system, who knows?

348
00:21:02,907 --> 00:21:06,240
The first few pages are
reserved for hardware flags, etc.

349
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:09,449
Assume page table entries
have eight status bits.

350
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:13,457
The eight status bits would then be...
Anybody?

351
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:17,477
And I see we have our first surrender.

352
00:21:17,478 --> 00:21:20,971
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg, brighter men
than you have tried and failed at this class.

353
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:27,741
One valid bit, 1 modify bit,
1 reference bit and 5 permission bits.

354
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:31,757
That is correct.

355
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:39,009
Mark?

356
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:40,926
Are you Mark Zuckerberg?

357
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:41,905
Yeah.

358
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,269
- Cameron Winklevoss.
- Hi...

359
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,432
Tyler Winklevoss.

360
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:47,122
Are you guys related?

361
00:21:47,157 --> 00:21:48,249
- It's good.
- Funny.

362
00:21:48,284 --> 00:21:50,080
We never heard that before.

363
00:21:50,115 --> 00:21:52,366
So what can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?

364
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:53,294
No, we didn't,

365
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:54,332
Actually... I don't know.

366
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:55,336
We never asked.

367
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:57,617
Maybe we should do that...

368
00:21:57,652 --> 00:22:01,604
We have an idea we want to talk
you about. Do you have a minute?

369
00:22:01,605 --> 00:22:03,606
You guys look like
you spend some time at a gym.

370
00:22:04,608 --> 00:22:06,447
We have to.

371
00:22:06,482 --> 00:22:09,146
We row crew.

372
00:22:09,181 --> 00:22:12,301
Yeah, I've got a minute.

373
00:22:15,674 --> 00:22:18,009
- So you ever been in The Porcellian?
- No

374
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:20,769
Alright we gonna stay, we can't take you
past the bike room 'cause you're not a member.

375
00:22:20,804 --> 00:22:22,787
I've heard.

376
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:27,599
Wanna sandwich or something?

377
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:29,931
Ok, Mark, right?

378
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:31,993
- Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

379
00:22:32,238 --> 00:22:33,694
We were really impressed with facemash.

380
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:36,347
And then we checked you out
and you also built CourseMatch.

381
00:22:36,382 --> 00:22:37,361
I don't know CourseMatch.

382
00:22:37,396 --> 00:22:39,792
You go online and you see what
courses your friend are takings...

383
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:42,339
You are really smart, man.

384
00:22:43,851 --> 00:22:45,427
- Mark...
- Yeah.

385
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:47,429
We were talking about "CourseMatch"

386
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:50,092
It was kind of a no brainer.

387
00:22:50,093 --> 00:22:52,184
And you invented something
in high school too, right?

388
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:56,127
An app for an MP3 player that
recognizes your taste in music.

389
00:22:56,162 --> 00:22:58,290
Anybody try to buy it?

390
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:00,430
Microsoft.

391
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:01,448
How much?

392
00:23:01,483 --> 00:23:03,456
I didn't sell it.
I uploaded for free.

393
00:23:03,491 --> 00:23:04,944
- For free?
- Yeah.

394
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:08,248
Why?

395
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:12,237
Ok, well. We have something that we've been
working for a while. We think it's great.

396
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:13,825
It's called HarvardConnection.

397
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,851
You create your own page.
Interests, bio, friends, pics.

398
00:23:16,852 --> 00:23:19,553
And then people could go
online, see your bio, request...

399
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:24,671
Yeah, how this different
from MySpace or Friendster?

400
00:23:24,706 --> 00:23:27,057
Harvard-dot-E-D-U.

401
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:29,430
Harvard.edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country.

402
00:23:29,465 --> 00:23:32,316
And the whole site kinda
base on the idea with girls...

403
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:35,726
- Not to putting anything in delicate.
- Girls wanna go with guys who go to Harvard.

404
00:23:35,727 --> 00:23:38,228
Divya and my brother don't have
trouble putting things in delicate.

405
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:40,177
Many different between
what we're talkin' about

406
00:23:40,178 --> 00:23:43,359
and MySpace or Friendster any
others social networks inside...

407
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,230
Is that exclusivity...
Right?

408
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:47,692
Right.

409
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,341
Yeah, we'd love you
to work with this Mark.

410
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,529
We need a gifted programmer
and you're creative.

411
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,030
And we know you would
take this serious...

412
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,033
Womens group already declare a war...

413
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,768
You know, this could help
rehabilitate you image.

414
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:01,882
Wow, you would do that for me?

415
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:05,249
We'd like to work with you.

416
00:24:05,284 --> 00:24:08,275
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work at Google.

417
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:10,856
Our second programmer just got
overwhelmed with school work.

418
00:24:10,857 --> 00:24:14,647
We will need you to build the site,
write the code and we'll provide...

419
00:24:14,648 --> 00:24:15,748
I'm in...

420
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,268
- What?
- I'm in.

421
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:21,795
Awesome!

422
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,122
That's what you said?

423
00:24:24,157 --> 00:24:26,583
It was 3 or 4 years ago...
I don't know what I said.

424
00:24:26,618 --> 00:24:27,956
When did you come Eduardo?

425
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:30,180
I don't understand the question.

426
00:24:30,215 --> 00:24:32,370
Do you remember
answering an affirmative?

427
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:33,726
The affirmative...

428
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:36,316
When did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for facebook?

429
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,471
It was called theFacebook then.

430
00:24:38,506 --> 00:24:40,609
It doesn't need to be that difficult.

431
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:43,147
I'm currently in the middle
of 2 different law suits.

432
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,346
Did you answer affirmatively,

433
00:24:44,381 --> 00:24:48,997
When Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Divya
Narendra ask you to build Harvard Connection,

434
00:24:48,998 --> 00:24:50,699
Did you say, yes?

435
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:53,165
I said I'd help.

436
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:56,368
When did you approached Mr. Saverin
with the idea for the facebook?

437
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:58,393
I wouldn't say I approached him.

438
00:24:58,394 --> 00:24:59,295
Sy?

439
00:24:59,296 --> 00:25:00,445
You can answer the question.

440
00:25:00,446 --> 00:25:02,947
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi

441
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:04,069
What's that?

442
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:06,671
The jewish fraternity.

443
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,239
It was Caribbean night.

444
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:28,765
It's not that guys like me are
generally attracted to Asian girls.

445
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,043
It's that Asian girls are
generally attracted to guys like me.

446
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:35,872
I'm developing an algorithm to define the
connection between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

447
00:25:35,907 --> 00:25:37,567
I don't think it's that complicated.

448
00:25:37,568 --> 00:25:41,828
They're hot, they're smart, they're
not Jewish and they can't dance.

449
00:25:42,563 --> 00:25:45,822
- Hey, Mark's here.
- Mark.

450
00:25:57,292 --> 00:25:58,462
I think I've come up with something.

451
00:25:58,497 --> 00:26:00,513
Hang on, I've gotta tell you
something you're not going to believe.

452
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:04,134
- What?
- I got punched by the Phoenix.

453
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,805
- Are You kidding?
- No.

454
00:26:06,806 --> 00:26:08,907
I mean it's just the
first of the 4 step process,

455
00:26:08,908 --> 00:26:11,610
But they slipped the invitation
under my door tonight.

456
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,411
I go to the first punch party tomorrow.

457
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,381
You got punch by The Phoenix.

458
00:26:17,382 --> 00:26:20,490
Yeah, probably, it was
just a diversity thing.

459
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:23,198
It was just a diversity thing.
I'll just ride that horse until...

460
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:25,508
What did you want to talk about?

461
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:26,349
- Mark?
- Yeah.

462
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,675
You said you've come up with something.

463
00:26:27,676 --> 00:26:29,954
Yeah, I think I've come up
with something. Come outside.

464
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,565
It's 20 degrees outside.

465
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:36,570
I can't stare to that loop of Niagara falls which
has absolutely nothing to do with the Caribbean.

466
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:49,583
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?

467
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:50,489
Yeah.

468
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,158
But it wasn't because the
saw pictures of hot girls.

469
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,826
You can go any around on the internet
and see pictures of hot girls.

470
00:26:53,861 --> 00:26:54,592
Yeah.

471
00:26:54,627 --> 00:26:58,588
That was because they saw
pictures of girls that they knew.

472
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:00,473
People wanna go on the internet
and check out their friends,

473
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:02,226
So why not build the
website that offers that?

474
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:05,933
Friends, pictures, profiles,
whatever you can visit, browse around.

475
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:09,039
Maybe its someone you just met at a party.
But I'm not talkin' about a dating site.

476
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:15,036
I'm talkin' about taking the entire social
experience of college and putting it online.

477
00:27:15,037 --> 00:27:16,028
I can't feel my legs

478
00:27:16,063 --> 00:27:19,646
I know, I'm totally psyched about this.
But Wardo...

479
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,377
Yeah...
It would be exclusive.

480
00:27:22,412 --> 00:27:25,669
You would've to know the people on
the site to get pass thru on page.

481
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,526
Like getting punched.

482
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:29,161
That's good

483
00:27:29,196 --> 00:27:31,569
Wardo, it's like a Final Clubs
except we're the president.

484
00:27:31,604 --> 00:27:34,071
I told him i thought it sounded great.

485
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:36,739
It was a great idea.

486
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,307
There's nothing to hack.

487
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:41,475
People were gonna provide their own
pictures, their own information.

488
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:46,626
And people had the ability to invite
or not invite their friends to join.

489
00:27:46,627 --> 00:27:50,176
See, in the world were the
social structure was everything.

490
00:27:50,177 --> 00:27:53,076
Puff...
That was the "THING".

491
00:27:53,077 --> 00:27:54,508
It was a big project.

492
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:57,426
And he was going to have to write
ten of thousands of lines of code.

493
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:00,042
So I wonder, why he was coming
to me and not to his room mate.

494
00:28:00,043 --> 00:28:02,935
Dustin Moskowitz and Chris
Hughes they're programmers.

495
00:28:02,936 --> 00:28:06,939
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent the servers and get it online.

496
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,536
So that was why.

497
00:28:08,537 --> 00:28:10,467
- Did he offers terms?
- Yes.

498
00:28:10,468 --> 00:28:12,581
We'll split it.
70-30

499
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:15,110
Seventy for me, Thirty for you for
you, putting up a thousands dollar.

500
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,827
And for handling everything on the business end.
You're CFO

501
00:28:17,828 --> 00:28:19,696
- And you said?
- I said "Let's do it"

502
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:23,815
- Ok, did he add anything else?
- Yes.

503
00:28:27,602 --> 00:28:31,740
It probably was
a diversity thing but so what?

504
00:28:32,554 --> 00:28:33,761
Why do you think he said that?

505
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:36,081
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting,
But whose discovery it is?

506
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:38,417
- Sy, if you let me continue with my line of question...
- What do you suggesting?

507
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:41,466
They're suggesting I was jealous of
Eduardo for getting punched by Phoenix.

508
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:44,214
And began a plan to screw him out of
the company I haven't even invented yet.

509
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:45,108
- Were you?
- Gretchen...

510
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:46,151
Jealous of Eduardo?

511
00:28:46,152 --> 00:28:47,415
Oh, stop typing,
we're off the record.

512
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:48,679
Maam, I know you've
done your home work.

513
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,530
And so you know that money
isn't a big part of my life,

514
00:28:50,532 --> 00:28:52,406
But at the moment I could buy
Mt. Auburn Street,

515
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:55,082
Take the Phoenix Club and
turn it into my pingpong room.

516
00:28:59,213 --> 00:29:02,326
I'll let you know how the party is,

517
00:29:07,863 --> 00:29:12,214
We recognize that you're a plaintiff in one
suit involving Facebook and a witness in another.

518
00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:14,972
- Yes, Sir.
- At any time In the weeks,

519
00:29:14,973 --> 00:29:16,848
Prior to Mark telling you his idea,

520
00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:21,641
Did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron
Winklevoss, Divya Narendra or HarvardConnection?

521
00:29:21,642 --> 00:29:24,400
Yes. He said they'd asked
him to work on their site.

522
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:28,003
But that he'd looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

523
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:33,390
He said even his most pathetic friends knew more about
getting people interested in a website than these guys.

524
00:29:34,025 --> 00:29:35,976
"These guys" meaning my clients.

525
00:29:35,977 --> 00:29:37,478
Yes. He resented, Mark resented
that they, that your clients,

526
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,129
Thought that he need to rehabilitate
his image after the Facemash thing

527
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,539
But Mark didn't want to
rehabilitate anything.

528
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,198
With Facemash he'd hack into Harvard
computers, he dumps his nose to the Ad Board.

529
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:52,390
He got a lot of honorarity.
Facemash did exactly what he wanted it to do.

530
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:55,827
Were you aware that while Mr.
Zuckerberg was building the Facebook,

531
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:57,396
He was also communicating
with the plaintiffs?

532
00:29:57,397 --> 00:30:00,765
Not at the time I wasn't.
But...

533
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,359
It really didn't have much to do
with The Winkelvoss dating site.

534
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,961
How would you know?
You' weren't even...

535
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:10,303
Were you aware that while Mr.
Zuckerberg was building TheFacebook,

536
00:30:10,304 --> 00:30:13,177
He was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building HarvardConnection?

537
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,192
You're offering a conclusion
not found an evidence.

538
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:16,997
We are about to finding new evidence...

539
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:23,075
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss
November 30, 2003

540
00:30:23,076 --> 00:30:24,931
I read over all the stuff you
sent me re-HarvardConnection,

541
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:28,578
and it seems like it shouldn't
take too long to implement,

542
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:33,185
so we can talk about it after I get all
the basic functionality up tomorrow night.

543
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:38,125
From Mark Zuckerberg to Cameron Winklevoss.
December 1, 2003.

544
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:41,248
"Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just
got about three of your missed calls.

545
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:44,247
I was working on a problem
set for my sytems class"

546
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:49,079
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler & Cameron Winklevoss.
December 10, 2003.

547
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,093
"This week has been pretty busy
thus far with classes and work"

548
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:55,040
"So I think it's probably
best to postpone the meeting."

549
00:30:55,041 --> 00:31:00,254
"I'm also really busy tomorrow"

550
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:05,168
Tell him okay but we do have to make sure that
we meet up before we all head off for break.

551
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:40,191
- Hi Mark,
- Hi,

552
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:43,412
I need a dedicated Linux box running
Apache with a mySQL back-end.

553
00:31:43,513 --> 00:31:45,366
It's gonna cost a little more money.

554
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:47,375
- How much more?
- About 200 more.

555
00:31:47,376 --> 00:31:50,332
- Do we need it?
- Gotta handle the traffic.

556
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:55,062
- Do it.
- I already did.

557
00:31:59,191 --> 00:32:03,758
Hey guess what...
I'm in the 2nd cut.

558
00:32:04,593 --> 00:32:07,126
That's good. You should
be proud of that right there,

559
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:09,659
Don't worry if you
don't make it any further.

560
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:15,312
I'll get out of here.

561
00:32:15,847 --> 00:32:19,811
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler and
Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Narendra.

562
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,762
December 15, 2003.

563
00:32:21,763 --> 00:32:24,557
I have a cs problem set that
I'm just getting started with,

564
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:27,951
And It should be about 15 hours of
coding so I'll be busy tomorrow night,

565
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:31,105
I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon.

566
00:32:31,606 --> 00:32:33,514
I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

567
00:32:33,515 --> 00:32:36,617
I've basically been in the
lab this whole time and also...

568
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,916
Won't be able to do it Saturday as
I have to meet up with my parents...

569
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,294
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.

570
00:32:50,295 --> 00:32:54,737
It's also called The Statue of Three Lies.
What are the three lies?

571
00:32:56,162 --> 00:32:57,034
Mr. Dowd.

572
00:32:57,069 --> 00:32:58,260
The three lies,

573
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:00,717
First...
Shit!

574
00:33:00,718 --> 00:33:02,747
- Take your pants off.
- I know.

575
00:33:04,175 --> 00:33:05,229
Mr. Saverin.

576
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:11,249
1) Harvard was founded in 1636 not 1638.
2) Harvard was not founded by John Harvard

577
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,023
and 3) That's not John Harvard.

578
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,525
Who is it?

579
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:18,354
F- friend of the sculptor,
Daniel... Chester.

580
00:33:19,355 --> 00:33:20,809
Keep you jacket on.

581
00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:27,968
39 days after Mr. Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients

582
00:33:27,969 --> 00:33:31,410
And he still hadn't completed
work on HarvardConnection.

583
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:35,217
But On January 11, 2004

584
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:42,148
Mr. Zuckerberg registered the domain
name theFacebook by Network Solution.

585
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:47,453
To the best of your knowledge, had he
even begun work on HarvardConnection?

586
00:33:47,488 --> 00:33:51,745
Not to my knowledge.
No.

587
00:33:57,107 --> 00:34:02,526
Hi Cameroon, "I'm still a little skeptical that we have
enough functionality in the site to really draw the attention

588
00:34:02,527 --> 00:34:06,301
And gain the critical mass necessary
to get a site like this to run"

589
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:08,924
We'll speak soon?

590
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:13,443
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem?

591
00:34:13,444 --> 00:34:14,344
Yes, he was

592
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:19,376
You'd sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return,

593
00:34:19,377 --> 00:34:21,602
And this was the first time he
indicated that he was not happy.

594
00:34:21,803 --> 00:34:22,603
That's correct!

595
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:25,866
He had 42 days to study our
system and get out ahead...

596
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:28,056
Do you see any of your code on Facebook?

597
00:34:28,057 --> 00:34:29,978
Did I use any of your code?

598
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:31,073
You stole our whole god damn idea.

599
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:32,074
Fellas,

600
00:34:32,075 --> 00:34:34,144
What a match-dot-com for Harvard guys!

601
00:34:34,145 --> 00:34:34,945
Can I continue with my deposition

602
00:34:34,946 --> 00:34:37,848
You know you really don't need a
forensic team to get to bottom of this

603
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:43,748
If you guys were the inventors of
Facebook you'd have invented Facebook.

604
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:47,011
I can't wait to stand over your
shoulder while you write us a check.

605
00:34:47,012 --> 00:34:48,161
No shit.

606
00:34:49,698 --> 00:34:50,939
Let's continue.

607
00:34:51,975 --> 00:34:54,790
February 4, 2004

608
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:01,868
Mark...
Mark...

609
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:05,309
There is a girl in your art
history class name Stephanie Attis.

610
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:09,391
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?

611
00:35:09,426 --> 00:35:13,080
Have you ever seen her with anyone.

612
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:16,152
And if not, do you happen to know if
she's looking to go out with anyone?

613
00:35:16,153 --> 00:35:19,253
Dustin...

614
00:35:19,254 --> 00:35:22,256
People don't walk around with
a sign on them that says some...

615
00:35:54,747 --> 00:35:56,848
We were supposed to meet at nine.

616
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,851
- Have you slept yet?
- I've to add something.

617
00:36:00,152 --> 00:36:00,852
What?

618
00:36:12,165 --> 00:36:14,613
Shit that's look good,
That's look really good.

619
00:36:14,648 --> 00:36:16,915
It's clean and simple,
no disneyland...

620
00:36:18,017 --> 00:36:18,917
But watch...

621
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:20,919
What'd you write?

622
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,326
Relationship status, Interested in,

623
00:36:25,327 --> 00:36:28,094
This is what drives live in college.
Are you having sex or aren't you

624
00:36:28,095 --> 00:36:31,159
It's why people take certain classes.
And sit where they sit.

625
00:36:31,194 --> 00:36:33,344
And do what they do, and
it's um, centre, you know,

626
00:36:33,345 --> 00:36:35,346
That what's thefacebook
is gonna be about...

627
00:36:35,347 --> 00:36:36,381
People gonna log on...

628
00:36:36,382 --> 00:36:38,984
Because after all the cake and watermelon,
there's a chance they're actually gonna...

629
00:36:38,985 --> 00:36:41,961
- Get laid...
- Meet a girl. Yes.

630
00:36:41,996 --> 00:36:43,839
- This is really good.
- And that was it.

631
00:36:44,074 --> 00:36:44,682
What d'you mean?

632
00:36:44,683 --> 00:36:46,454
- It's ready.
- It's ready?

633
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:49,910
That was it, and here's the masthead.

634
00:36:49,911 --> 00:36:51,947
- You made a masthead.
- Yeah.

635
00:36:51,982 --> 00:36:55,123
Eduardo Saverin, Co-Founder and CFO.

636
00:36:55,124 --> 00:36:57,392
You have no idea how what
that's gonna mean for my father.

637
00:36:57,393 --> 00:36:58,893
Sure I do...

638
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:05,784
- When's it go on live?
- Right now, take your laptop out.

639
00:37:06,786 --> 00:37:09,406
Why we do need my laptop.

640
00:37:09,441 --> 00:37:12,033
Because you've got e-mails
for everybody at Phoenix.

641
00:37:16,658 --> 00:37:20,701
I'm not sure it's gonna be cool
with them that I spam their...

642
00:37:20,736 --> 00:37:22,195
It's not spam.

643
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,302
I know it's not spam

644
00:37:23,337 --> 00:37:25,117
If we send it to our friends it'll
just bounce around the computer lab.

645
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,780
I haven't gotten in yet.

646
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:30,474
These guys know people
and I need their e-mails.

647
00:37:31,398 --> 00:37:32,520
- Sure
- Good.

648
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,118
Give me the mailing list.

649
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,662
jabberwock12@harvard E-D-U.

650
00:37:37,663 --> 00:37:38,558
These guys.

651
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:41,992
They're literary geniuses 'cause the world's
most obvious Lewis Caroll reference is in their...

652
00:37:41,9rlin?

653
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:25,456
It's a Valentine's theme.
They playing love songs.

654
00:38:25,457 --> 00:38:31,045
Good point, 'cause Cole Porter and
Irving Berlin never wrote any love songs.

655
00:38:32,822 -->brate.

656
00:37:58,749 --> 00:38:00,434
I'm buying.

657
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:04,328
Mark,

658
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:08,916
Mark, are you praying?

659
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:22,851
What ever happened to Cole
Porter and Irving Be93 --> 00:37:42,881
They're not so bad

660
00:37:42,882 --> 00:37:44,605
I'm just saying.
Yeah, you're right.

661
00:37:52,372 --> 00:37:53,825
The site's live.

662
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,714
You know, Let's go get
a drink and cele 00:38:35,126
Honey, just put your laptop away...

663
00:38:35,127 --> 00:38:37,228
Seventy four people
spam me the same link.

664
00:38:37,229 --> 00:38:38,229
Casey...

665
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,578
- What is it?
- I don't know

666
00:38:39,613 --> 00:38:43,874
But I'm really hoping it's cat look like a
hitler 'cause I can never get enough of that.

667
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:46,619
No, it's not.

668
00:38:51,144 --> 00:38:54,738
Div?
What?

669
00:39:02,747 --> 00:39:03,747
Div, w-what is wrong?

670
00:39:25,843 --> 00:39:27,644
- Hey!
- Not now!

671
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:30,285
- We need 20 mins.
- Ok.

672
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:36,450
I just want to let you know that
Zuckerberg stole our website.

673
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:40,030
- Mark Zuckerberg?
- He stole our website.

674
00:39:41,032 --> 00:39:45,010
It's been alive for more than 36 hours.

675
00:39:48,233 --> 00:39:49,578
Mr. Hotchkiss

676
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:51,125
Ty, the lawyer's on the phone with dad.

677
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,147
Yes, Sir. I'm here with my brother
Tyler, our business partner, Divya.

678
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:58,022
Welcome to theFacebook. theFacebook is an online directory
that connects people through different social networks.

679
00:39:58,057 --> 00:40:00,448
You must have a Harvard.edu
address to register.

680
00:40:00,749 --> 00:40:01,449
That's right.
Yes, Sir.

681
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,806
I called earlier, I'm
looking for Mark Zuckerberg

682
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:06,089
Yes, Sir. He's quoted a couple of times.
I can read it to you.

683
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:09,092
"Everyone's been talking a lot about
a universal facebook within Harvard"

684
00:40:10,495 --> 00:40:13,791
I think it's kind of silly that it would take the
University a couple of years to get around to it.

685
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:16,636
I can do it in class jobs than
they can't and I did it in a week.

686
00:40:16,637 --> 00:40:19,492
- Tell him, Divya Narendra called, I appreciate it.
- That's how we talks.

687
00:40:19,994 --> 00:40:26,034
As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg set over
650 students to registered thefacebook.com

688
00:40:26,035 --> 00:40:29,784
He said that he anticipated 900 students
would've join the site by this morning.

689
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:33,176
Divya was just reading that 650
students signed up on the first day

690
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:37,729
If I was I drug dealer I could give
free drugs to 650 people in one day.

691
00:40:37,764 --> 00:40:39,744
This guy doesn't have 3 friends to rob...

692
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:41,105
Guys, please, come on...

693
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,234
Alright that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss

694
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:44,990
Then we e-mail it to you.

695
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,381
You won't be able to get
on the website yourself.

696
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:49,700
Because you don't have a harvard... uhm..

697
00:40:49,735 --> 00:40:52,123
you know what it would be easy
for us to e-mail it to you.

698
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,011
I'm sure you right... He's a good guy,

699
00:40:54,012 --> 00:40:58,790
And he's very bright and I'm sure he
didn't mean to... do what he did.

700
00:40:58,825 --> 00:41:00,950
Alright,
thank you very much...

701
00:41:00,985 --> 00:41:03,133
And Dad,
Love you too.

702
00:41:03,168 --> 00:41:03,859
He good guy?

703
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,767
We don't know that he's not a good guy.

704
00:41:05,802 --> 00:41:07,086
We know he Stole our idea

705
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:08,371
We know that he lied to our
faces for a month and half

706
00:41:08,406 --> 00:41:09,704
He never lie to our face

707
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:11,707
He never saw our faces!
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts.

708
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:14,207
So he got himself 42-days head start

709
00:41:14,242 --> 00:41:17,796
He knows what apparently you don't which
is that getting there first is everything.

710
00:41:17,797 --> 00:41:19,269
I'm a competitive racer, Div,

711
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,975
I don't think you need to school me on the
importance of getting there first. Thank you.

712
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:24,048
Alright, that's was your father's lawyer?

713
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:24,900
Yeah, well his in-house counsel.

714
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:28,724
He's gonna look at all this if he thinks it's
appropriate he'll send a cease and desist letter.

715
00:41:28,725 --> 00:41:30,515
What, do you wanna hire
an IP lawyer and sue him?

716
00:41:30,516 --> 00:41:33,922
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer!

717
00:41:33,957 --> 00:41:35,123
- We don't have to do that.
- That's right.

718
00:41:35,124 --> 00:41:36,339
We can do that ourself.

719
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,031
I'm six-five, 220lbs, and there's two of me.
I'm with this guy.

720
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:42,228
Whatever, I'm saying let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

721
00:41:42,263 --> 00:41:45,726
how much more information
are you waiting for.

722
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:48,818
We met with Mark 3 times, exchanged 52 e-mails,
we can prove that he looked at the code...

723
00:41:48,853 --> 00:41:50,645
what is that on the bottom of page

724
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,089
It's "A Mark Zuckerberg production"

725
00:41:52,124 --> 00:41:53,397
On the homepage?

726
00:41:53,432 --> 00:41:54,203
On every pages.

727
00:41:54,204 --> 00:41:57,206
Shit. I need to let the
classiness waft over me.

728
00:41:57,207 --> 00:41:58,207
Ok, look...

729
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:00,278
They wrote, "Zuckerberg said that
he hoped the privacy options...

730
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:05,149
...would help to restore his reputation
following student outrage over Facemash.com"

731
00:42:05,184 --> 00:42:08,731
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us "the finger" in the Crimson

732
00:42:08,766 --> 00:42:13,512
While we're waiting for dad's
lawyer to look this stuff over, we can at least...

733
00:42:13,547 --> 00:42:15,386
No...

734
00:42:15,421 --> 00:42:19,204
We're not starting a knife fight in
the Crimson and we're not suing anybody.

735
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:22,596
Why not?

736
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:27,073
He's gonna say it's stupid.

737
00:42:27,108 --> 00:42:28,569
What, who?
Me?

738
00:42:28,604 --> 00:42:30,471
Say it why not?

739
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:33,757
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

740
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:39,168
This is Harvard. Where you don't plant
stories and you don't sue people.

741
00:42:39,203 --> 00:42:41,792
You thought he was going to be the
only one who thought that was stupid?

742
00:42:41,911 --> 00:42:45,724
During the time when you say you had this idea,

743
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:49,271
Did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?

744
00:42:49,272 --> 00:42:50,704
A family of means?

745
00:42:50,705 --> 00:42:53,465
Did you know that his father was wealthy.

746
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,442
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.

747
00:42:55,477 --> 00:42:57,384
It's not important that you
be sure why I'm asking you.

748
00:42:57,419 --> 00:42:58,270
It's not important to you.

749
00:42:58,305 --> 00:42:59,261
Sy...

750
00:42:59,296 --> 00:43:02,191
Did you know that they came from money?

751
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:04,560
I had no idea whether they
came from money or not.

752
00:43:04,595 --> 00:43:09,954
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra you
reference Tate Winklevoss consulting firm.

753
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:11,248
If you say so.

754
00:43:11,283 --> 00:43:15,149
Howard Winklevoss founded the firm and its
assets are in the hundreds of millions.

755
00:43:15,184 --> 00:43:19,775
You also knew that Tyler and Cameron were members
of a Harvard Final club called the Porcellian.

756
00:43:19,776 --> 00:43:20,776
They pointed that out?

757
00:43:20,777 --> 00:43:22,494
Excuse us for inviting you in.

758
00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:24,177
To the bike room...

759
00:43:24,212 --> 00:43:27,474
So it's safe to say you were
aware that my clients had money?

760
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,171
Yes.

761
00:43:30,206 --> 00:43:32,550
Let me tell you why I'm asking.
I'm wondering why...

762
00:43:32,551 --> 00:43:36,615
If you needed a $1000 for an internet
venture you didn't ask my clients for it.

763
00:43:36,616 --> 00:43:39,179
They'd demonstrated to you an
interest in this kind of thing...

764
00:43:39,214 --> 00:43:42,090
I went to my friend for the money because
that he's who I wanted to be partners with...

765
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:46,807
Eduardo was presidents of the Harvard Inverstors
Association and he was also my best friend.

766
00:43:48,443 --> 00:43:51,930
Your best friend is suing
you for 600 million dollars.

767
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:53,986
I didn't know that.
tell me more!

768
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:56,650
Eduardo, what happen
after the initial lunch?

769
00:43:56,685 --> 00:43:59,308
Sy would you mind addressing as Mr. Saverin

770
00:43:59,343 --> 00:44:00,140
Gretchen, they're best friend

771
00:44:00,175 --> 00:44:00,908
Not anymore

772
00:44:00,943 --> 00:44:02,891
I already went through this on the...

773
00:44:02,926 --> 00:44:05,688
Nevermind, Mr. Saverin...

774
00:44:05,723 --> 00:44:07,095
It's exploded, everybody
on campus was using it

775
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:12,613
"Facebook-me" was the common
expression after two weeks.

776
00:44:12,648 --> 00:44:14,449
and Mark...

777
00:44:14,484 --> 00:44:18,302
And Mark was biggest thing on a campus
that included 19 Nobel Laureates,

778
00:44:18,337 --> 00:44:21,724
15 Pulitzer Prize Winners,
two future Olympians

779
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,255
and a movie star.

780
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:24,879
Who's the movie star?

781
00:44:24,914 --> 00:44:26,637
Does it matter?

782
00:44:26,672 --> 00:44:28,361
No.

783
00:44:36,227 --> 00:44:40,723
Beautiful day. And I was up in my Radcliffe dorm.
He brought that magazine up and he saw it to me

784
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:44,573
And he said, "Look, it's gonna happen
without us. We've got to start now."

785
00:44:44,608 --> 00:44:46,423
And I said... "Okay."

786
00:44:46,661 --> 00:44:47,661
Let's get basic hardware.

787
00:44:47,662 --> 00:44:49,663
Most of you think you know the
rest of story that you may not.

788
00:44:49,664 --> 00:44:53,871
The beginning of the
industry were very humble...

789
00:44:53,906 --> 00:44:58,078
That kit computer on the cover of that
magazine, had an 8080 processor in it.

790
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:02,446
Unless you paid extra for 1K memory
board 256bits, so the challenges...

791
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,761
Isn't that Mark Zuckerberg?

792
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:16,755
Yeah

793
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:18,717
- He made facebook?
- Yeah.

794
00:45:18,718 --> 00:45:23,331
I mean both of us. Yeah, we... yes.

795
00:45:23,366 --> 00:45:27,071
Cool. I'm Christy Lee.
This is Alice.

796
00:45:29,056 --> 00:45:30,483
Nice to meet you

797
00:45:30,518 --> 00:45:33,136
Facebook-me when you get home
We can all go out and grab a drink.

798
00:45:33,171 --> 00:45:38,101
Certainly, absolutely will do that.

799
00:45:43,755 --> 00:45:47,309
She said "Facebook-me" and we
can all go for a drink later.

800
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,910
Which is stunningly great for two reasons.

801
00:45:48,911 --> 00:45:51,582
One she said "Facebook-me". Right?
And the other...

802
00:45:51,617 --> 00:45:52,617
- They wanna have drinks later.
- Yes

803
00:45:52,652 --> 00:45:56,188
Have you ever heard so many different good
things packed into one regular-sized sentence?

804
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:57,766
Excuse me. Mark?

805
00:45:57,801 --> 00:45:59,045
Yeah

806
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,548
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your O.S. lab.

807
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:03,312
Sure.

808
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:05,463
- Awesome job with theFacebook.
- Awesome Job.

809
00:46:05,498 --> 00:46:06,552
Thanks.

810
00:46:06,553 --> 00:46:08,287
- I'm Bob.
- How are you doin'.

811
00:46:08,288 --> 00:46:10,395
You know, I could swear he
was looking at you when he said

812
00:46:10,396 --> 00:46:13,305
The next Bill Gates could
be right in this room.

813
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,626
I doubt it

814
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:18,654
I showed up late, I don't
even know who the speaker was.

815
00:46:18,689 --> 00:46:20,905
It was Bill Gates.

816
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,089
Shit... that's make sense.

817
00:46:23,524 --> 00:46:25,520
Alright, thanks guys.

818
00:46:29,325 --> 00:46:30,714
Are you moron? Are you medically stupid?

819
00:46:30,749 --> 00:46:32,136
You can't recognize Bill Gates
in front of you for an hour?

820
00:46:32,337 --> 00:46:33,524
Mark Zuckerberg now thinks we got into Harvard
on a dimwit scholarship. I'm gonna get a Glock...

821
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:40,157
It's time to monetize the thing.

822
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:41,052
What are their natives?

823
00:46:41,053 --> 00:46:42,734
- Did you heard what I just said?
- When?

824
00:46:42,735 --> 00:46:45,208
I said it's times to monetize the site

825
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:47,497
What is that mean?

826
00:46:47,532 --> 00:46:50,291
It means time for the
website generating the revenue.

827
00:46:50,326 --> 00:46:53,817
No, I know what the word means.
I'm asking how do you want to do it?

828
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:54,747
Advertising.

829
00:46:54,748 --> 00:46:56,049
No.

830
00:46:57,051 --> 00:46:58,351
We've got 4000 members.

831
00:46:58,386 --> 00:46:59,617
'Cause theFacebook is cool.

832
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:01,727
And if we start selling pop-ups
for Mountain Dew it's not gonna be cool.

833
00:47:01,728 --> 00:47:02,728
Well I wasn't thinking it would
be Mountain Dew but at some point,

834
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,732
And I'm talkin' as the business
end of the company, the site...

835
00:47:06,733 --> 00:47:10,206
We don't even know what it
is yet, we don't what it is...

836
00:47:10,207 --> 00:47:11,207
We don't know what it can be.

837
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:14,023
We don't know what it will be.
We know that it's cool,

838
00:47:14,524 --> 00:47:16,838
That's a priceless asset
and I'm not giving it up.

839
00:47:16,873 --> 00:47:19,059
- So it won't be finish?
- It won't be finish.

840
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,844
That's the point, the way fashion never finish

841
00:47:20,845 --> 00:47:22,646
- What?
- Fashion, fashion is never finish.

842
00:47:22,647 --> 00:47:24,490
You talkin' about fashion, really you?

843
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:27,413
I'm talkin' about the idea
I'm sayin' that never finish

844
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:32,094
Ok, but they manage to
make money, sellin' pants

845
00:47:32,129 --> 00:47:33,646
Mark what is this?

846
00:47:33,681 --> 00:47:35,128
What?

847
00:47:35,163 --> 00:47:37,352
It's called the cease and desist letter.
What were their names?

848
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:38,721
- Who?
- The girls.

849
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:39,504
When did you get this?

850
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:42,016
About ten days ago.
Right after we launched the site

851
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:44,051
Hey, the girls what were their names?

852
00:47:44,086 --> 00:47:47,115
They're sayin'... the Winklevoss twins
are sayin' that you stole their idea.

853
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:49,424
I find that to be mildly annoying.

854
00:47:49,459 --> 00:47:53,008
They find it to be
Intelectual Property Theft.

855
00:47:53,043 --> 00:47:54,292
- Look...
- Why don't you show it to me?

856
00:47:54,327 --> 00:47:56,009
It was addressed to me

857
00:47:56,044 --> 00:47:58,865
They're sayin' that we stole theFacebook
from Divya Narendra and the Winklevoss...

858
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,938
I know what it says.

859
00:47:59,973 --> 00:48:00,842
Did we?

860
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,061
Did we what?

861
00:48:02,096 --> 00:48:03,425
Don't screw around with me now.

862
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,583
Look at me

863
00:48:04,618 --> 00:48:06,467
The letter says we could face legal action.

864
00:48:06,502 --> 00:48:08,281
No, it says I could face legal action

865
00:48:08,316 --> 00:48:10,556
This is from lawyer, Mark.
They must feel they have some grounds for...

866
00:48:10,591 --> 00:48:12,672
The lawyer is their father's house counsel.

867
00:48:12,707 --> 00:48:13,406
Do they have grounds?

868
00:48:13,441 --> 00:48:16,477
The grounds are our thing is cool and
popular and HarvardConnection is lame.

869
00:48:16,512 --> 00:48:20,075
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code,
I promise, I didn't use anything.

870
00:48:20,076 --> 00:48:23,474
Look, a guy who builds a really nice chair doesn't
owe money to everyone who's ever built a chair.

871
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:25,441
Ok, they came to me with
an idea. I had a better one.

872
00:48:25,776 --> 00:48:26,699
Why didn't you show me this letter

873
00:48:26,734 --> 00:48:29,245
I didn't think it was a big deal

874
00:48:33,557 --> 00:48:37,056
If there's something wrong,
if there's ever anything wrong,

875
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:39,230
You can tell me.

876
00:48:39,231 --> 00:48:40,231
I'm the guy that wants to help.

877
00:48:40,232 --> 00:48:41,232
This is our thing.

878
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:45,027
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me

879
00:48:45,062 --> 00:48:48,464
No.

880
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:51,397
What are we doing about this?

881
00:48:51,432 --> 00:48:54,810
I went to a 3-L at Student Legal Services
and he told me to write them back.

882
00:48:54,845 --> 00:48:55,869
And what did you say?

883
00:48:55,904 --> 00:48:59,302
When we met in January, I
express my doubts about the site,

884
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:03,592
where it stood with graphic, how much
programming was left that I had not anticipated...

885
00:49:03,593 --> 00:49:05,594
...the lack of hardware we
had to deal with the site use,

886
00:49:05,595 --> 00:49:08,631
the lack of promotion that we go on
to successfully launch the website...

887
00:49:08,632 --> 00:49:12,408
This was the first time you
raised any of those concern, right?

888
00:49:12,443 --> 00:49:14,086
I'd raised concerns before.

889
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:15,548
Bullshit
Not to us

890
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:16,128
Gentlemen.

891
00:49:16,163 --> 00:49:19,929
I'm talkin about at the meeting in
January to which this letter is referring.

892
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:20,896
Yeah.

893
00:49:20,931 --> 00:49:23,223
Let me re-phrase this.

894
00:49:23,224 --> 00:49:27,744
You sent my client 16 e-mails. In the
first 15, you did't raise any concerns

895
00:49:27,779 --> 00:49:28,611
Is that a question?

896
00:49:28,646 --> 00:49:32,327
In the 16th e-mail you raised
concerns about the site functionality.

897
00:49:32,362 --> 00:49:35,010
Were you leading them on for six weeks?

898
00:49:35,045 --> 00:49:35,532
No.

899
00:49:35,567 --> 00:49:38,657
Why didn't you raise any
of these concern before?

900
00:49:38,692 --> 00:49:39,613
It's raining.

901
00:49:39,648 --> 00:49:40,421
I'm sorry?

902
00:49:40,456 --> 00:49:41,584
It's just started raining.

903
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:45,309
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?

904
00:49:45,844 --> 00:49:47,292
No.

905
00:49:47,327 --> 00:49:49,761
Do you think I deserve it?

906
00:49:49,796 --> 00:49:50,901
What?

907
00:49:50,936 --> 00:49:54,313
Do you think I deserve your full attention?

908
00:49:54,348 --> 00:49:57,690
I had to swear an oath before we began this
deposition, and I don't want to perjure myself,

909
00:49:57,725 --> 00:49:59,391
So I have a legal obligation to say no.

910
00:49:59,426 --> 00:50:03,377
Okay - no.
You don't think I deserve your attention.

911
00:50:03,412 --> 00:50:06,224
I think if your clients want to sit on
my shoulders and call themselves tall,

912
00:50:06,259 --> 00:50:07,780
They have the right to give it a try,

913
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:11,903
But there's no requirement that I enjoy
sitting here listening to people lie.

914
00:50:12,138 --> 00:50:15,489
You have part of my attention -
you have the minimum amount.

915
00:50:15,524 --> 00:50:18,077
The rest of my attention is back
at the offices of theFacebook,

916
00:50:18,078 --> 00:50:20,569
Where my colleagues and I are doing
things that no one in this room,

917
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:24,092
Including and especially your clients, are
intellectually or creatively capable of doing.

918
00:50:26,151 --> 00:50:30,031
Did I adequately answer
your condescending question?

919
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:40,426
I have 12:45, why don't we say that's lunch.

920
00:50:40,461 --> 00:50:44,027
Back at 02:30.

921
00:50:44,062 --> 00:50:47,973
So what were their names?

922
00:50:48,008 --> 00:50:51,850
Their names are Christy and Alice.

923
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:55,970
And They wanna have drinks tonight

924
00:51:22,217 --> 00:51:24,334
I don't care.

925
00:51:45,827 --> 00:51:50,505
Hey man, sorry, uhmm, couple of
girls refreshing up in there.

926
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,022
Sweet...

927
00:51:56,789 --> 00:52:00,054
We have groupies.

928
00:52:06,908 --> 00:52:09,247
I'll be right back
Hey, where you goin'?

929
00:52:09,282 --> 00:52:10,987
Mark...

930
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:16,052
Erica

931
00:52:18,453 --> 00:52:19,133
Hey

932
00:52:19,134 --> 00:52:20,178
I saw you from over there

933
00:52:20,213 --> 00:52:22,700
- I don't know you came to this club a lot.
- First time.

934
00:52:22,735 --> 00:52:23,955
Mine too.

935
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,755
Can I talk you alone for a second?

936
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:29,171
I think I'm good right here

937
00:52:29,206 --> 00:52:32,260
I just... I'd love to talk you alone

938
00:52:32,295 --> 00:52:34,574
Right here is fine

939
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,488
I don't know if you heard about
this new website I launched.

940
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:38,857
- No
- TheFacebook?

941
00:52:38,858 --> 00:52:41,510
You called me a bitch on internet, Mark.

942
00:52:41,511 --> 00:52:42,759
That's why, I wanna talk to you...

943
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,960
- On the internet...
- If you could just...

944
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:45,319
That's why I came over

945
00:52:45,354 --> 00:52:47,252
Comparing women to farm animals?

946
00:52:47,253 --> 00:52:48,716
I didn't end up doing that.

947
00:52:48,717 --> 00:52:50,270
It didn't stop you from writing it.

948
00:52:50,271 --> 00:52:56,890
As if every thought that tumbles through your head is
so clever, it would be a crime for it not to be share.

949
00:52:57,291 --> 00:53:00,044
The internet's not written in pencil, Mark,
it's written in ink,

950
00:53:00,045 --> 00:53:02,779
And you published that
Erica Albright was a bitch.

951
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,563
Right before you made some ignorant
crack about my family's name, my bra size...

952
00:53:07,598 --> 00:53:10,014
And then rated women
based on their hotness.

953
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,395
- Erica, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

954
00:53:13,973 --> 00:53:18,488
You write your snide bullshit from a dark room
because that's what the angry do nowadays.

955
00:53:19,224 --> 00:53:21,800
I was nice to you
don't torture me for it.

956
00:53:21,801 --> 00:53:23,698
If we could just go
somewhere for a minute...

957
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:26,197
I don't want to be rude to my friends,

958
00:53:26,198 --> 00:53:28,998
- Okay.
- Okay.

959
00:53:30,325 --> 00:53:32,634
Good luck with your video game.

960
00:53:32,735 --> 00:53:33,635
Dude, that's was great...

961
00:53:33,636 --> 00:53:36,609
That was right thing to do,
you apologize, right?

962
00:53:39,346 --> 00:53:41,722
We have to expand.

963
00:53:44,243 --> 00:53:45,765
Is he mad about something?

964
00:53:47,101 --> 00:53:49,441
Okay, we're expanding
to Yale and Columbia.

965
00:53:49,442 --> 00:53:51,043
Dustin, I want you to share
the coding work with me.

966
00:53:51,044 --> 00:53:52,992
Chris, you're gonna be in
charge of publicity and outreach.

967
00:53:52,993 --> 00:53:55,685
You can start by gettin' a story in
B.U student newspaper. It's the bridge.

968
00:53:55,686 --> 00:53:57,529
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

969
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:59,781
Somebody at the newspaper will
be a computer science major.

970
00:53:59,782 --> 00:54:02,106
Tell 'em Mark Zuckerberg will do 10
hours of free programming for them.

971
00:54:02,107 --> 00:54:03,995
Why do you want a story
in the B.U. newspaper...

972
00:54:03,996 --> 00:54:04,496
Because I do.

973
00:54:04,497 --> 00:54:07,358
Now, here's the arrangement.
Eduardo's CFO and owns 30% of the company.

974
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,819
Dustin's Vice President and Head of Programming
and his 5% of the company will come from my end.

975
00:54:11,854 --> 00:54:15,680
Chris is Director of Publicity and his compensation will
depend on the amount of work he ends up doing.

976
00:54:15,715 --> 00:54:17,034
- Any questions?
- Who the girls?

977
00:54:17,469 --> 00:54:20,084
Sorry, uhmm...
they are Christy and Alice.

978
00:54:20,185 --> 00:54:21,886
- Hi...
- Hi. Hello.

979
00:54:23,605 --> 00:54:26,216
- Is there anything we can do?
- No, that's it.

980
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:27,862
Yale and Columbia, let's go.

981
00:54:27,863 --> 00:54:29,874
- And Stanford...
- What?

982
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:34,303
Standford. It's time for
them to see this in Palo Alto.

983
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:42,566
- You don't want any lunch?
- No.

984
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:43,860
You're welcome to some salad.

985
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:44,861
No, thank you.

986
00:54:51,869 --> 00:54:53,882
This must be hard.

987
00:54:54,957 --> 00:54:55,857
Who are you?

988
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,486
I'm Marylin Delpy,
I introduced myself this morning.

989
00:54:58,487 --> 00:55:00,001
I mean, what do you do?

990
00:55:00,002 --> 00:55:05,681
I'm a second year associate at the firm.
My boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition phase.

991
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,833
What are you doin'?

992
00:55:08,868 --> 00:55:11,216
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.

993
00:55:11,251 --> 00:55:12,339
Bosnia?

994
00:55:12,474 --> 00:55:15,670
They don't have roads
but they have Facebook.

995
00:55:20,772 --> 00:55:24,227
You must really hate the Winklevoss.

996
00:55:24,262 --> 00:55:26,681
I don't hate anybody.

997
00:55:26,682 --> 00:55:29,942
The Winklevii aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.

998
00:55:29,943 --> 00:55:32,514
They're suing me because for
the first time in their lives,

999
00:55:32,515 --> 00:55:36,486
Things didn't work at the way
they were supposed to for them.

1000
00:55:42,728 --> 00:55:45,126
- He's expanding.
- What?

1001
00:55:45,127 --> 00:55:48,780
He's expanding to Yale, Columbia and Stanford,
it's gonna be in the Crimson tomorrow.

1002
00:55:48,815 --> 00:55:49,829
Really?
Yeah.

1003
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:53,141
Well, it's look like that Cease and desist letter
really scared the shit out of him, huh?

1004
00:55:53,176 --> 00:55:55,908
I want to hire a lawyer to file for injunctive relief
and get this website taken down now!

1005
00:55:55,909 --> 00:55:56,175
Look...

1006
00:55:56,176 --> 00:55:59,107
Every minute, the site's up, Harvard
Connection become less valuable.

1007
00:55:59,108 --> 00:56:03,273
I want an injunction, I want damages,
punitive relief and I want him dead.

1008
00:56:03,274 --> 00:56:03,867
I want those things too!

1009
00:56:03,868 --> 00:56:07,088
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?!
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?!

1010
00:56:07,089 --> 00:56:08,605
Because you're not thinking
about how it's gonna look.

1011
00:56:08,606 --> 00:56:09,523
How's it gonna look?

1012
00:56:09,524 --> 00:56:13,414
Like my brother and I are in skeleton costumes
chasing the Karate Kid around a high school gym.

1013
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:17,219
Cam, he violated Massachusetts state law.

1014
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,522
When he goes to Connecticut, New York and
California he'll have violated federal law.

1015
00:56:20,523 --> 00:56:22,764
And by the way, he's in violation of Harvard law.

1016
00:56:22,765 --> 00:56:24,368
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1017
00:56:24,369 --> 00:56:27,408
Wait, Yes, there is.

1018
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:33,459
Harvard student handbook.

1019
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,462
Every freshman is issued one of this.
Somewhere in this book says...

1020
00:56:36,463 --> 00:56:38,607
You can't steal from another student.

1021
00:56:39,908 --> 00:56:41,481
This is what we needed.

1022
00:56:41,716 --> 00:56:43,908
You can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.

1023
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:47,557
My brother and I pay tuition at this
school, we carry a 3.9 GPA at this school,

1024
00:56:47,558 --> 00:56:51,283
We've won trophies for this school and
We'll be rowing in the Olympics for this school.

1025
00:56:51,284 --> 00:56:53,841
I want a meeting with the
goddamn president of this school.

1026
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:56,153
Why Stanford?

1027
00:56:56,988 --> 00:56:59,630
W- Why do you think?

1028
00:57:02,434 --> 00:57:05,636
I'm sorry, I'm late for Bio Chem..

1029
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:08,639
Okay.

1030
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,824
You don't know my name, do you?

1031
00:57:12,859 --> 00:57:14,910
Is it Stanford?

1032
00:57:14,911 --> 00:57:16,899
I should just kick your ass.

1033
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,858
How you go to party
and you meet somebody...

1034
00:57:18,859 --> 00:57:22,461
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy.
You're from Orinda

1035
00:57:22,462 --> 00:57:26,129
Your father in commercial real estate
and your mother is 10 years sober.

1036
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:27,750
What's my major?

1037
00:57:27,751 --> 00:57:28,844
Trombone.

1038
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:29,868
Really?

1039
00:57:29,869 --> 00:57:31,783
I remember something about a trombone.

1040
00:57:31,784 --> 00:57:35,283
"Tu fais l'amour  la jolie fille et la mets de ct"
*You make love to the pretty girl and put it aside*

1041
00:57:35,284 --> 00:57:36,955
- French...
- Oui

1042
00:57:36,956 --> 00:57:37,956
Your major is French.

1043
00:57:37,957 --> 00:57:38,957
And yours?

1044
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:39,361
Mine?

1045
00:57:39,896 --> 00:57:40,936
I don't have one.

1046
00:57:40,976 --> 00:57:43,173
You haven't declared?

1047
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:44,669
I don't go to school.

1048
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,005
- You kidding?
- No.

1049
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,065
Where did you go to school?

1050
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:51,826
William Elementary for a little while,

1051
00:57:51,827 --> 00:57:55,607
Seriously, you're not like 15
years old or anything are you?

1052
00:57:55,642 --> 00:57:58,003
No.

1053
00:57:58,038 --> 00:57:59,418
But you're not like 15, are you?

1054
00:57:59,419 --> 00:58:01,019
No.

1055
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,228
So what do you do?

1056
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,668
I'm an entrepreneur.

1057
00:58:06,703 --> 00:58:07,753
You're unemployed.

1058
00:58:07,754 --> 00:58:08,959
I wouldn't say that.

1059
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,195
What would you say?

1060
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:11,448
That I'm an entrepreneur.

1061
00:58:11,449 --> 00:58:13,154
Well then, what was your latest preneur?

1062
00:58:13,155 --> 00:58:17,926
Well, I founded an internet company that
let folks download and share music for free.

1063
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,253
Kinda like Napster?

1064
00:58:19,254 --> 00:58:20,807
Exactly like Napster.

1065
00:58:20,808 --> 00:58:22,670
What do you mean?

1066
00:58:22,671 --> 00:58:24,064
I founded Napster.

1067
00:58:24,065 --> 00:58:26,029
Sean Parker founded Napster.

1068
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:27,832
Nice to meet you.

1069
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:28,956
You're Sean Parker.

1070
00:58:28,957 --> 00:58:33,958
Ah, you see, the shoe's on the other,
uh, table which has turned.

1071
00:58:34,493 --> 00:58:36,016
I just slept with Sean Parker?

1072
00:58:36,017 --> 00:58:38,572
You just slept on Sean Parker.

1073
00:58:38,607 --> 00:58:39,911
You're zillionaire.

1074
00:58:39,946 --> 00:58:41,190
Not technically

1075
00:58:41,225 --> 00:58:42,645
What are you?

1076
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,125
Broke. There's not a lot of money in free music.

1077
00:58:45,126 --> 00:58:48,054
Even less when you're being sued by
everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.

1078
00:58:48,055 --> 00:58:49,720
This is blowing my mind.

1079
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:50,521
I appreciate that

1080
00:58:50,522 --> 00:58:52,675
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.

1081
00:58:52,676 --> 00:58:56,279
Biochem, even know you are in French major,
whose name is Amy.

1082
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,281
You passed.

1083
00:58:58,282 --> 00:58:59,282
I'm a hard worker.

1084
00:59:01,483 --> 00:59:04,993
There's juice or anything else
you can find. Help yourself.

1085
00:59:04,994 --> 00:59:06,127
You mind if I check my e-mail?

1086
00:59:06,128 --> 00:59:07,872
Yeah. go ahead.

1087
00:59:17,877 --> 00:59:19,277
Amy...

1088
00:59:22,281 --> 00:59:23,281
Amy?

1089
00:59:23,282 --> 00:59:24,282
Yeah!

1090
00:59:24,283 --> 00:59:25,496
Can you come out here?

1091
00:59:25,531 --> 00:59:28,106
Just a second!

1092
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:32,365
There's a snake in here, Amy.
What?

1093
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,113
Where?

1094
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,115
Ok, there isn't snake but I need to ask you something.

1095
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,305
Are you kidding me?
I could've been killed!

1096
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,386
How?

1097
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:45,379
By running to you fast and gettin' twisted...

1098
00:59:45,414 --> 00:59:47,016
What do you need to ask me?

1099
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:50,291
I went to check my e-mail
and there's a website open on your computer.

1100
00:59:50,326 --> 00:59:54,032
Yeah. After you passed out last night,
I went on theFacebook for 'lil bit.

1101
00:59:54,067 --> 00:59:55,711
What's that?

1102
00:59:55,746 --> 00:59:58,898
TheFacebook? Standford had it for,
like two weeks now.

1103
00:59:58,933 --> 01:00:02,715
It's really awesome except
it's freakishly addictive.

1104
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:05,131
Seriously, I'm on the thing like five times a day.

1105
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:07,028
You mind if I set myself an e-mail.

1106
01:00:07,063 --> 01:00:08,891
Yes, everything okay?

1107
01:00:08,926 --> 01:00:10,448
Everything's great.

1108
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:13,681
I just need to find...

1109
01:00:13,716 --> 01:00:17,934
You,
Mark Zuckerberg.

1110
01:00:19,212 --> 01:00:20,875
I've never been in this building before.

1111
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:24,088
This building is a hundred years
older than the country it's in.

1112
01:00:24,089 --> 01:00:25,690
So do be careful.

1113
01:00:26,392 --> 01:00:28,630
We're sitting in the chairs.

1114
01:00:28,631 --> 01:00:31,929
Yes. Very good.

1115
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:34,433
You can go in now.

1116
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,615
That's just their own stupidity,
I should have been there.

1117
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:45,185
Darkness is the absence of light and stupidity
in that instance was the absence of me.

1118
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:49,988
Catherine, I've got students in my office now.
Students. Undergrads.

1119
01:00:49,989 --> 01:00:54,602
I don't know, from the looks of it, they want
to sell me Brooks Brothers Franchise. Alright.

1120
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:56,766
Good morning.
Good morning, Sir.

1121
01:00:56,801 --> 01:00:58,758
I'm Cameron Winklevoss and
this is my brother, Tyler.

1122
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:02,483
And you here, because...

1123
01:01:02,518 --> 01:01:04,056
Either of you can answer.

1124
01:01:04,091 --> 01:01:05,053
I thought you were reading the letter.

1125
01:01:05,054 --> 01:01:06,195
I've read the letter.

1126
01:01:06,196 --> 01:01:09,242
Well, we came up with an idea for
a website called HarvardConnection...

1127
01:01:09,243 --> 01:01:11,488
That we've since changed
the name to ConnectU,

1128
01:01:11,723 --> 01:01:13,701
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...

1129
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:16,863
I'm understand. I'm asking
what you want me to do about it?

1130
01:01:16,864 --> 01:01:20,976
Well Sir, in The Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman...

1131
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:23,714
Under the heading "Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community"

1132
01:01:23,715 --> 01:01:26,418
It says, The College expects
that all students to be honest...

1133
01:01:26,419 --> 01:01:29,120
And forthcoming in their dealings
with members in this community.

1134
01:01:29,121 --> 01:01:32,903
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership.

1135
01:01:32,938 --> 01:01:34,821
Instances of theft, misappropriation or...

1136
01:01:34,822 --> 01:01:36,470
- Ann...
- Yes Sir.

1137
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:38,611
Punch me in the face...
Go ahead.

1138
01:01:41,527 --> 01:01:45,302
Or unauthorized use will
result in disciplinary action,

1139
01:01:45,303 --> 01:01:47,304
Including the requirement
to withdraw from the College.

1140
01:01:47,305 --> 01:01:49,640
You memorize that instead of doing, what?

1141
01:01:49,641 --> 01:01:53,572
What my brother and I come, here today,
to ask you, respectfully of course...

1142
01:01:53,607 --> 01:01:56,215
Sir, it's against University rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.

1143
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,659
You've spoken to your House-master.

1144
01:01:57,694 --> 01:02:01,814
Yes Sir, and the House-master made a recommendation to the Ad Board but the Ad Board won't hear us.

1145
01:02:01,849 --> 01:02:03,517
Have you tried dealing with the other student directly?

1146
01:02:03,552 --> 01:02:07,482
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding to any of
our e-mails or phone calls for the last two weeks.

1147
01:02:07,517 --> 01:02:09,678
He doesn't answer when we
knock on his door at Kirkland.

1148
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:12,744
And the closest I've come to dealing with
him face to face is when I saw him on the quad,

1149
01:02:12,745 --> 01:02:14,210
And I chased him through Harvard Square.

1150
01:02:14,245 --> 01:02:14,859
You chased him?

1151
01:02:14,894 --> 01:02:18,193
I- I saw him and I know he saw me
and after a minutes he disappeared.

1152
01:02:18,428 --> 01:02:20,424
I don't see this as the university issue.

1153
01:02:20,425 --> 01:02:22,148
Of course this is a university issue.

1154
01:02:22,149 --> 01:02:24,350
There's a code of ethics and an
honor code and he violated them both.

1155
01:02:24,351 --> 01:02:28,413
You entered into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.

1156
01:02:28,448 --> 01:02:32,042
I'm sorry President Summers, but
what you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1157
01:02:32,077 --> 01:02:33,484
I'm devastated by that.

1158
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:36,177
What my brother means is if Mark
Zuckerberg breaking into our dorm room

1159
01:02:36,212 --> 01:02:38,715
And stole our computer, that
would be university issue.

1160
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,931
I don't know this office
doesn't handle petty larceny.

1161
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:44,337
This isn't petty larceny. This idea
potentially worth millions of dollars.

1162
01:02:44,372 --> 01:02:45,542
- Millions?
- Yes.

1163
01:02:45,543 --> 01:02:48,173
You might just be letting your
imaginations run away with you.

1164
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:51,132
Sir, I actually don't think you're in
any position to make that call.

1165
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:55,226
I was the U.S. Treasury Secretary,
I'm in some position to make that call

1166
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:59,474
Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly
what we were told us to do in your freshmen address.

1167
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:03,687
I would suggest that you let your imaginations run away with you on a new project.

1168
01:03:03,722 --> 01:03:06,219
- You would?
- Yes, everyone at Harvard is eventing something.

1169
01:03:06,254 --> 01:03:10,934
Harvard Undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than finding a job.

1170
01:03:10,969 --> 01:03:15,016
So I suggest again that the two of you come up with a new, new project.

1171
01:03:15,051 --> 01:03:16,549
I'm sorry, but that's not the point, Sir.

1172
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,561
Please what's the point.

1173
01:03:18,596 --> 01:03:21,481
You don't have to be an intellectual property expert
to understand the difference between right and wrong.

1174
01:03:21,516 --> 01:03:22,967
And you're saying that I don't.

1175
01:03:23,002 --> 01:03:24,303
Of course I'm not saying that.

1176
01:03:24,338 --> 01:03:25,761
I'm saying that.

1177
01:03:25,796 --> 01:03:26,619
- Really?
- Sir...

1178
01:03:27,473 --> 01:03:29,157
Ann... How do they get this appointment?

1179
01:03:29,192 --> 01:03:31,434
Colleagues of their father...

1180
01:03:32,569 --> 01:03:37,580
Let me tell you something Mr. Winklevoss,
Mr. Winklevoss, since you under subject of right and wrong.

1181
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:41,683
This action, this meeting,
the two of you being here is wrong.

1182
01:03:41,718 --> 01:03:45,767
Is not worthy of Harvard,
Is not what Harvard saw in you...

1183
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:47,769
You don't get special treatment!

1184
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:49,185
We never ask for it...

1185
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:52,524
Just start another project? Like we're making a diorama for the science fair?

1186
01:03:52,525 --> 01:03:54,171
If you have problems with that Mr. Winklevoss

1187
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:55,423
We never ask for special treatment.

1188
01:03:55,424 --> 01:03:58,001
The court are always at your disposal...

1189
01:03:58,036 --> 01:04:00,555
Is there anything else, I could do for you?

1190
01:04:02,558 --> 01:04:03,558
Thank you very much for your time, Sir.

1191
01:04:09,935 --> 01:04:13,783
Ups, broke 335 years old your door knob.

1192
01:04:15,608 --> 01:04:19,047
Eduardo, spring break, you and Mr.
Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1193
01:04:19,282 --> 01:04:20,877
What was the purpose of the trip?

1194
01:04:20,878 --> 01:04:25,723
Well, as CFO, I'd set up some
meetings with potential advertisers.

1195
01:04:26,058 --> 01:04:26,892
Who paid for the trip?

1196
01:04:26,893 --> 01:04:30,169
It was paid for out of the thousand dollar
account I'd set up a few months earlier.

1197
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:34,134
At this point your thousand dollars was the
only money that had been put into the company.

1198
01:04:34,169 --> 01:04:34,750
Yes.

1199
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:36,752
How did you feel the meetings went?

1200
01:04:37,842 --> 01:04:38,842
It went terribly.

1201
01:04:38,843 --> 01:04:39,896
Why?

1202
01:04:39,897 --> 01:04:40,897
Mark was asleep.

1203
01:04:40,898 --> 01:04:42,559
I was not asleep.

1204
01:04:42,594 --> 01:04:44,026
Can I re-phrase my answer?

1205
01:04:44,027 --> 01:04:47,392
I wish he'd been asleep.

1206
01:04:48,956 --> 01:04:52,704
So we're at 29 schools now
with over 75.000 members.

1207
01:04:53,305 --> 01:04:57,013
People who go on theFacebook tend to stay
on longer than almost any other website.

1208
01:04:57,014 --> 01:05:01,878
Now here's the most impressive statistic,
61% of people who try it once, will come back...

1209
01:05:01,879 --> 01:05:02,977
Now if you'll allow me...

1210
01:05:02,978 --> 01:05:05,112
Excuse me, one second...
What sound that he's making?

1211
01:05:05,113 --> 01:05:08,654
Is that like a tsk...

1212
01:05:08,689 --> 01:05:10,364
It wasn't tsk...

1213
01:05:17,406 --> 01:05:20,533
Guys, what is this?

1214
01:05:20,568 --> 01:05:23,426
There was one more meeting
scheduled for the New York trip.

1215
01:05:23,427 --> 01:05:24,427
Yes, it was a dinner.

1216
01:05:24,828 --> 01:05:26,429
It was set up through my
girlfriend at the time.

1217
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:29,727
Would you say that Mark was
excited about this meeting?

1218
01:05:29,728 --> 01:05:32,131
Yes, very.

1219
01:05:32,132 --> 01:05:34,184
- Look, they're not gonna card us...
- They might.

1220
01:05:34,185 --> 01:05:34,885
I mean look around.

1221
01:05:34,886 --> 01:05:35,886
It'll be embarrassing.

1222
01:05:36,087 --> 01:05:38,082
Tell him they're not gonna card us.

1223
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:39,083
They're not gonna card us.

1224
01:05:39,084 --> 01:05:39,771
Mark...

1225
01:05:39,806 --> 01:05:40,958
Are you gonna talk about ads again?

1226
01:05:40,993 --> 01:05:44,736
Unless you're the Ballet Theatre of Hartford, the purpose of a business is to make a profit.

1227
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:45,999
This isn't a business, yet.

1228
01:05:46,034 --> 01:05:50,824
That's tough for me because my job...
Nevermind.

1229
01:05:53,012 --> 01:05:54,214
He's 25 mins late.

1230
01:05:54,615 --> 01:05:57,266
He founded Napster when
he was 19, he can be late.

1231
01:05:57,267 --> 01:05:58,037
He's not a God.

1232
01:05:58,038 --> 01:05:59,252
Then what is he?

1233
01:05:59,253 --> 01:06:00,253
He's 25 minutes late.

1234
01:06:00,554 --> 01:06:01,751
I think Wardo's jealous.

1235
01:06:01,786 --> 01:06:05,082
I honestly wasn't jealous.
I was nervous.

1236
01:06:05,117 --> 01:06:06,362
Why?

1237
01:06:06,397 --> 01:06:10,733
I didn't know him at all but I
had done a search and asked around...

1238
01:06:10,734 --> 01:06:16,706
He struck me as kind of a wild card.

1239
01:06:16,741 --> 01:06:17,582
Why?

1240
01:06:17,617 --> 01:06:21,622
He crashed out of two pretty big
internet companies in spectacular fashion,

1241
01:06:21,623 --> 01:06:22,627
He's had a reputation with drugs.

1242
01:06:22,962 --> 01:06:24,199
He also founded the companies.

1243
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:26,134
We don't need him.

1244
01:06:26,169 --> 01:06:28,170
He's here.

1245
01:06:30,745 --> 01:06:32,446
No, no, take your time.

1246
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:33,747
And he does own a watch.

1247
01:06:34,148 --> 01:06:35,257
Stop it.

1248
01:06:36,775 --> 01:06:37,668
I'm Sean Parker.

1249
01:06:37,669 --> 01:06:38,068
How do you do.

1250
01:06:38,069 --> 01:06:42,920
You must be Eduardo and Christy
and Mark, great to meet you.

1251
01:06:42,955 --> 01:06:45,386
You guys don't have
anything in front of you.

1252
01:06:45,387 --> 01:06:45,887
Tori...

1253
01:06:46,088 --> 01:06:46,533
We were waiting...

1254
01:06:46,568 --> 01:06:47,609
Hey baby boy.

1255
01:06:47,644 --> 01:06:49,119
Could you bring out some things?

1256
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:53,799
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit, tuna
tartar, and the lobster claws, that'll get us started.

1257
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,528
Christy what do you like to drink?

1258
01:06:57,563 --> 01:06:58,444
An appletini

1259
01:06:58,479 --> 01:07:01,328
Great. Four of those.

1260
01:07:01,363 --> 01:07:04,151
From that point on it was a Sean-a-thon.

1261
01:07:12,718 --> 01:07:16,137
The question was what did you talk about?

1262
01:07:27,391 --> 01:07:29,546
He took us through his episode with Napster.

1263
01:07:29,547 --> 01:07:32,549
I didn't want to spend my twenty
as a professional defendant

1264
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:35,552
Who knew the music industry
doesn't have a sense of humor.

1265
01:07:35,778 --> 01:07:39,359
We tried to sell the company to pay the
35 millions they said we owed in royalties,

1266
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:44,291
But I guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen card to pay for the stolen gas.

1267
01:07:44,492 --> 01:07:47,039
So we said, screw it, we declare bankruptcy.

1268
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,040
You made a name for yourself.

1269
01:07:48,341 --> 01:07:49,967
And you are dry.

1270
01:07:49,968 --> 01:07:51,594
- Tory...
- No, no, I'm good.

1271
01:07:51,595 --> 01:07:57,536
And then he went to his second business
venture which was an online rolodex.

1272
01:07:57,571 --> 01:08:01,985
And I want to do it nice this time, I put on a tie, i shine my shoes.

1273
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:03,430
But nobody want to take orders from a kid.

1274
01:08:03,431 --> 01:08:04,431
So let me tell you what happen...

1275
01:08:07,108 --> 01:08:08,608
I'm not psychiatrist, but

1276
01:08:08,643 --> 01:08:09,773
I'm glad with got that on record.

1277
01:08:09,808 --> 01:08:12,369
You're not a psychiatrist, but what...

1278
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:15,271
A psychiatrist would
say that he was paranoid.

1279
01:08:15,272 --> 01:08:17,247
They hire private detectives,
who follow you day and night.

1280
01:08:17,782 --> 01:08:20,530
You are target for hi press-escort.

1281
01:08:20,531 --> 01:08:22,532
I can't prove it but I
know they tap my phone.

1282
01:08:22,533 --> 01:08:25,535
Whatever it is that's gonna
trip you up, you're done already.

1283
01:08:25,536 --> 01:08:27,936
Private behaviour is
really cover time gone by...

1284
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,939
And then somehow and someway you've
manage to live your life like a Dalai lama

1285
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:31,941
Don't mixed it up.

1286
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:34,661
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.

1287
01:08:34,662 --> 01:08:36,984
And they want you to
say thank you while you,

1288
01:08:36,985 --> 01:08:39,640
Excuse me... wipe your
chin and walk away.

1289
01:08:39,641 --> 01:08:40,834
That's what happen to you?

1290
01:08:40,835 --> 01:08:42,128
And delusional.

1291
01:08:42,563 --> 01:08:43,681
Yes,

1292
01:08:43,716 --> 01:08:45,593
But... they'll be pay back.

1293
01:08:45,628 --> 01:08:49,459
In case I brought down the record company with
Napster and I left the company since then too.

1294
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,996
Sorry, you didn't bring down
the record companies. They won.

1295
01:08:52,997 --> 01:08:54,536
In court.
Yeah.

1296
01:08:54,571 --> 01:08:58,007
You wanna buy a Tower record, Eduardo?

1297
01:09:00,508 --> 01:09:04,194
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley,

1298
01:09:04,195 --> 01:09:07,944
Parties at Stanford and down in LA,
friends who'd become millionaires,

1299
01:09:07,945 --> 01:09:13,021
But mostly how Mark had to,
he had to come to California.

1300
01:09:13,356 --> 01:09:16,176
And then he cut around to theFacebook.

1301
01:09:16,177 --> 01:09:18,539
So tell me about your progress.

1302
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:22,642
Well, we're in 29 schools now,
we got over 75 thousands members...

1303
01:09:22,643 --> 01:09:23,562
Tell me about the strategy.

1304
01:09:23,597 --> 01:09:28,241
Ok, for instance, we wanted Baylor in Texas but
Baylor already had a social network on campus

1305
01:09:28,242 --> 01:09:31,734
So instead of going right after them, we made
a list of every school within a hundred miles

1306
01:09:31,735 --> 01:09:33,321
And put theFacebook on those campuses first.

1307
01:09:33,322 --> 01:09:35,524
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were
seeing their friends on our site.

1308
01:09:35,525 --> 01:09:36,834
- We were in.
- Its called a little bait for a big one.

1309
01:09:36,835 --> 01:09:37,635
That's smart, Mark.

1310
01:09:37,636 --> 01:09:38,502
Thanks that's was mine.

1311
01:09:38,503 --> 01:09:38,914
Easy.

1312
01:09:38,915 --> 01:09:42,931
Hey you know what, settle an argument for us,
I say it's time to start making money from theFacebook

1313
01:09:42,932 --> 01:09:46,183
But Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?

1314
01:09:46,918 --> 01:09:48,533
Neither of you yet.

1315
01:09:48,534 --> 01:09:49,625
TheFacebook is cool,

1316
01:09:49,626 --> 01:09:50,716
- That's what it's got going for it.
- Yeah.

1317
01:09:51,451 --> 01:09:52,143
You don't want to ruin it with ads

1318
01:09:52,344 --> 01:09:53,777
- Because ads aren't cool.
- Exactly.

1319
01:09:54,012 --> 01:09:55,853
It's like you're throwing
the greatest party on campus.

1320
01:09:55,854 --> 01:09:57,728
And someone's saying,
it's gotta be over by 11:00.

1321
01:09:57,729 --> 01:09:58,784
That's exactly right.

1322
01:09:58,785 --> 01:10:00,846
You don't even know what the thing is yet.

1323
01:10:00,881 --> 01:10:02,673
How big it can get and how far it can go.

1324
01:10:02,674 --> 01:10:04,682
This is no time to take your chips down.

1325
01:10:04,683 --> 01:10:06,639
A million dollars isn't cool.
You know what's cool?

1326
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,440
You?

1327
01:10:09,899 --> 01:10:11,549
A billion dollars.

1328
01:10:15,262 --> 01:10:17,245
And that shut everybody up.

1329
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,858
And that's where you're headed.
A billion dollar valuation.

1330
01:10:21,893 --> 01:10:25,136
Unless you take bad advice in which case you might as well
come up with a chain of very successful yogurt shop.

1331
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:29,878
When you go fishing you can catch a
lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

1332
01:10:29,879 --> 01:10:31,834
You ever walk into a guy's den and see a
picture of him standing next to fourteen trout?

1333
01:10:33,235 --> 01:10:35,031
No he's holding an 3000 pound marlin.

1334
01:10:35,032 --> 01:10:36,228
- Yup.
- That's a good announce.

1335
01:10:36,263 --> 01:10:39,231
But we all know, that marlin
won't weight 3000 pounds, right?

1336
01:10:39,266 --> 01:10:40,771
- I've seen a big one at close
- No, I haven't.

1337
01:10:40,772 --> 01:10:42,973
But I don't think the guy holdings
a marlin at size of a range rover.

1338
01:10:42,974 --> 01:10:45,846
That would really big fish or a very strong guy.

1339
01:10:45,847 --> 01:10:47,750
You think I might be
getting away from the point?

1340
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:48,941
I don't have a dog in this fight.

1341
01:10:48,942 --> 01:10:50,943
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.

1342
01:10:50,978 --> 01:10:54,251
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1343
01:10:54,286 --> 01:10:58,195
He picked up the check, He told Mark
they'd talk again soon and he was gone.

1344
01:10:58,196 --> 01:11:01,899
But not before he made his biggest
contribution to the company.

1345
01:11:03,997 --> 01:11:08,742
Drop the "the".
Just Facebook. It's cleaner.

1346
01:11:12,244 --> 01:11:14,057
Shit.

1347
01:11:23,328 --> 01:11:26,150
That's gotta be some kind of
land speed record for talking.

1348
01:11:26,185 --> 01:11:29,281
You want to end the party at eleven?

1349
01:11:29,316 --> 01:11:30,605
I'm trying to pay for the party.

1350
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,662
There won't be a party unless it's cool.

1351
01:11:33,697 --> 01:11:35,124
What'd you think?

1352
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:36,993
Yes, sure, let's drop the "the"

1353
01:11:37,028 --> 01:11:41,535
I meant catching the marlin instead of the 14 trouts. Doesn't that sound good?

1354
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:43,221
If you're a trout.

1355
01:11:43,222 --> 01:11:44,697
I'm going to enter this into the record.

1356
01:11:44,698 --> 01:11:48,572
Incorporation papers for Facebook,
and LLC registered in Florida,

1357
01:11:48,573 --> 01:11:50,901
- Why Florida?
- That's where my family lives.

1358
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:55,097
And ask the respondent to stipulate that the documents
of incorporation state the ownership as follows,

1359
01:11:55,098 --> 01:12:00,990
Sixty-five percent for Mark Zuckerberg, 30 percent for
Eduardo Saverin and 5 percent for Dustin Moskowitz.

1360
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:01,898
We stipulate

1361
01:12:01,899 --> 01:12:04,067
And that was April 13th 2004

1362
01:12:04,068 --> 01:12:05,268
You can mark it.

1363
01:12:05,269 --> 01:12:06,347
Do you have anything here?

1364
01:12:06,382 --> 01:12:09,105
Yes, thank you.
Mr. Saverin,

1365
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:15,563
Have you ever done anything that might be
considered legitimate ground for termination?

1366
01:12:15,598 --> 01:12:16,515
No.

1367
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:21,458
You never did anything to embarrass the company or even seriously jeopardize it?

1368
01:12:21,493 --> 01:12:22,074
No.

1369
01:12:22,426 --> 01:12:23,137
No?

1370
01:12:26,255 --> 01:12:27,340
No.

1371
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:31,398
You were accused of animal cruelty.

1372
01:12:31,433 --> 01:12:32,952
Wait.

1373
01:12:32,987 --> 01:12:34,212
You weren't?

1374
01:12:34,247 --> 01:12:35,758
T- this not happening.

1375
01:12:35,793 --> 01:12:38,058
I have here an article from The Crimson...

1376
01:12:38,093 --> 01:12:40,028
Jesus Christ...

1377
01:12:40,063 --> 01:12:41,109
I can't have this, Wardo.

1378
01:12:41,144 --> 01:12:46,341
Come on, man this is bullshit, this is
another clubs playing a prank.

1379
01:12:46,376 --> 01:12:50,386
I'd gotten into the Phoenix. I'd been
accepted and as part of my initiation,

1380
01:12:50,387 --> 01:12:54,869
I had to, for one week, carry with me
all the times and take care of a chicken.

1381
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:59,409
They identify you as one of the founders of theFacebook, "Junior Eduardo Saverin,"

1382
01:12:59,444 --> 01:13:02,748
I'm not the expert but being connected to torturing animals is probably bad for business.

1383
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:07,549
I did not torture the chicken,
I don't torture chickens, are you crazy?

1384
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:09,378
No, and settle down, please.

1385
01:13:09,379 --> 01:13:11,113
I have here, an article from The Crimson...

1386
01:13:11,114 --> 01:13:12,558
This is scathing.

1387
01:13:12,593 --> 01:13:13,884
Nine-hundred-fifty-six.

1388
01:13:13,919 --> 01:13:16,747
I was having dinner in the
Kirkland Dining Hall with Mark,

1389
01:13:16,782 --> 01:13:21,450
And I had the chicken with me because I had to have
the chicken with me at all times. This was college.

1390
01:13:21,485 --> 01:13:23,214
Somebody gonna have to answer for this.

1391
01:13:23,249 --> 01:13:24,071
Nine-hundred-sixty-nine.

1392
01:13:24,106 --> 01:13:27,855
Dining hall was serving chicken for dinner and I had to feed my chicken.

1393
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:31,936
So I took... Little pieces of
chicken and gave it to the chicken.

1394
01:13:31,937 --> 01:13:36,409
Someone must have seen me because the next thing
I knew I was being accused of forced cannibalism.

1395
01:13:36,976 --> 01:13:41,475
I didn't know you could't do that. I dealt
with the various animal rights groups,

1396
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:46,108
I dealt with the Associate Dean of
the College, this was all resolved.

1397
01:13:46,143 --> 01:13:47,200
Nine-hundred-eighty-eight.

1398
01:13:47,235 --> 01:13:49,515
Someone from the Porc or
the Fly must have reported it.

1399
01:13:49,516 --> 01:13:51,388
For all I know it was the Winklevoss...

1400
01:13:51,423 --> 01:13:53,026
Alright, let's just forget about it.

1401
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:57,543
This is absurd, I'm being accused of animal cruelty.
Better to be accused of Necrophilia.

1402
01:13:57,578 --> 01:13:58,951
It is better to be accused of Necrophilia.

1403
01:13:59,386 --> 01:14:00,670
I have to explain this to my father,

1404
01:14:00,671 --> 01:14:04,256
I'm gonna explain this to everybody, I'm
gonna... what is happening on that?

1405
01:14:04,257 --> 01:14:06,605
I have my final coming up for
"Postwar and Contemporary Art".

1406
01:14:06,606 --> 01:14:09,317
And I haven't been to class. I'm supposed
to write about those four paintings.

1407
01:14:09,352 --> 01:14:10,244
Is that a facebook page?

1408
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:13,610
Yeah, I opened it under an alias. I posted
the paintings and asked people to comment.

1409
01:14:13,611 --> 01:14:16,532
Every once in a while, I hop on and
stir the pot to get a good debate going.

1410
01:14:16,567 --> 01:14:18,679
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating on his final exam?

1411
01:14:18,714 --> 01:14:20,728
I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.

1412
01:14:20,763 --> 01:14:21,669
Then why not?

1413
01:14:21,704 --> 01:14:25,931
Because I'm not suing him for cheating on his
final exam and so that's not what friends do.

1414
01:14:25,966 --> 01:14:27,979
Well you just told us he was cheating.

1415
01:14:29,314 --> 01:14:31,915
Oops.

1416
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:34,448
You told your lawyers I was torturing animals?!

1417
01:14:34,483 --> 01:14:35,830
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

1418
01:14:35,865 --> 01:14:38,806
Our litigators are capable
of finding Crimson article.

1419
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:43,147
In fact when we raised the
subject with him he defended you.

1420
01:14:43,782 --> 01:14:45,076
Oops.

1421
01:14:45,111 --> 01:14:48,574
Nine-ninety-three, we are so close.

1422
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:51,154
Oh yeah, that reminds me,
We're gonna need more money, Wardo.

1423
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:53,664
I agree. More servers, more apps...

1424
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:56,511
I'm interviewing two interns to come to Palo Alto and we're gonna have to pay them something.

1425
01:14:56,546 --> 01:14:57,358
Sorry what?

1426
01:14:57,393 --> 01:15:00,258
I already found a house for rent on a street two blocks from the Stanford campus.

1427
01:15:00,293 --> 01:15:01,968
It is perfect and it's got a pool.

1428
01:15:02,003 --> 01:15:03,643
When did you decide to go
to California for the summer?

1429
01:15:03,678 --> 01:15:04,923
You mean when did I actually decide?

1430
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:08,390
Somewhere in the middle of
The Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1431
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:11,056
He was right. California's the place we've gotta be.

1432
01:15:11,091 --> 01:15:12,508
Is you Jed Clampett?

1433
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:14,242
You guys got The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil...

1434
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,139
Yes, we got the show in Brazil, it was genius.

1435
01:15:16,174 --> 01:15:18,078
What is your problem with Sean?

1436
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:20,036
He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1437
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:21,960
He doesn't have money,
Dustin's a better programmer...

1438
01:15:21,995 --> 01:15:23,396
He's got connections to the VCs.

1439
01:15:23,431 --> 01:15:26,979
We don't need VCs, we need advertisers and I've got connections to the VCs.

1440
01:15:27,014 --> 01:15:28,233
- The real players and...
- Look

1441
01:15:28,268 --> 01:15:29,838
As someone who's really embarrassed
the company in a bad way...

1442
01:15:30,373 --> 01:15:31,747
It was the Winklevosses, Mark!

1443
01:15:31,748 --> 01:15:35,045
Hang on.
Hit refresh.

1444
01:15:35,046 --> 01:15:37,840
150.004

1445
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:40,415
150.000 members, Wardo.

1446
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:41,571
Congratulations, dude.

1447
01:15:41,606 --> 01:15:42,742
Congratulations.

1448
01:15:42,777 --> 01:15:46,382
You don't think it was strange?
That he was followed by private detectives?

1449
01:15:46,617 --> 01:15:47,952
Who came up with nothing.

1450
01:15:47,987 --> 01:15:50,265
Enough to get him out of the company.
The drugs, the girls...

1451
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,439
We don't know any of that's true.

1452
01:15:51,474 --> 01:15:52,544
You can read about it.

1453
01:15:52,579 --> 01:15:54,788
I can read about your torturing birds.
Since when reading something about...

1454
01:15:54,789 --> 01:15:57,929
Don't fish eat other fish?!
The marlins and the trout?!

1455
01:16:00,607 --> 01:16:01,145
What's he talkin' about?

1456
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:04,172
I'm interviewing interns at 10
tomorrow night in the CS lab.

1457
01:16:04,173 --> 01:16:07,567
Get on board with this man, you know...
I don'60
You know I didn't understand
anything you just said, right?

1458
01:16:55,195 --> 01:16:56,486
- I do know that.
- So what't really know what else to say.

1459
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:44,133
What's goin' on?

1460
01:16:44,134 --> 01:16:46,961
They have 10 mins to get root
access to a Python web server,

1461
01:16:46,962 --> 01:16:50,158
Expose its SSL encryption and then
intercept all traffic over its secure port.

1462
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:50,659
They're hacking.

1463
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:53,499
All behind a Pix Firewall Emulator.
But here's the beauty.

1464
01:16:53,534 --> 01:16:55,1s the beauty?

1465
01:16:56,521 --> 01:16:58,227
Every 10th line of code written,
they have to take a shot.

1466
01:16:58,262 --> 01:16:59,712
And hacking's supposed to be stealth,

1467
01:16:59,713 --> 01:17:03,163
So anytime the server detects an intrusion,
the candidate responsible has to take a shot.

1468
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:06,885
I also have a program running that has a pop-up
window appear simultaneously on all five computers...

1469
01:17:06,886 --> 01:17:09,173
The last candidate to hit
the window has to take a shot.

1470
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,969
Plus every three minutes
they all have to take a shot.

1471
01:17:11,004 --> 01:17:12,619
Three minutes.

1472
01:17:14,236 --> 01:17:17,918
Can I ask, what part of the interns jobs will they need to be able to do drunk?

1473
01:17:17,953 --> 01:17:23,082
You're right. A more relevant test would be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1474
01:17:23,117 --> 01:17:24,403
That was mean.

1475
01:17:24,404 --> 01:17:25,404
Here...

1476
01:17:25,405 --> 01:17:27,094
What is this.

1477
01:17:27,129 --> 01:17:29,017
I opened a new account
and put $18.000 in it.

1478
01:17:31,407 --> 01:17:32,907
Will that get you through the summer?

1479
01:17:40,879 --> 01:17:43,253
Welcome to Facebook.

1480
01:17:52,571 --> 01:17:54,065
- $18.000
- Yes.

1481
01:17:54,066 --> 01:17:56,768
- In addition to the $1000 you'd already put up.
- Yes.

1482
01:17:56,769 --> 01:17:58,949
A total of $19.000 now.

1483
01:17:58,984 --> 01:18:00,257
- Yes.
- Hang on.

1484
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:04,876
I'm just checking your math on that.

1485
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:06,899
Yes, I got the same thing.

1486
01:18:07,488 --> 01:18:08,715
May I continue?

1487
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:14,004
After expressing misgivings about Mr. Zuckerberg taking
the company and moving it to California for the summer,

1488
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:17,302
Why did you turn around and put
$18.000 in an account for his use?

1489
01:18:17,337 --> 01:18:20,485
I figured we were partners.
I wanted to be a team player.

1490
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,856
I figured Mark, Dustin and the
new interns could work on the site.

1491
01:18:23,857 --> 01:18:26,592
While I was on generating
advertiser interest in New York.

1492
01:18:26,627 --> 01:18:31,184
But mostly I figured, how much could
possibly go wrong in three months?

1493
01:18:58,807 --> 01:19:01,096
I'm ok.
You sure...

1494
01:19:01,131 --> 01:19:02,203
Yikes.

1495
01:19:04,686 --> 01:19:06,140
That's the doorbell

1496
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:07,193
I don't know we had a door bell.

1497
01:19:07,194 --> 01:19:08,187
Andrew get the door.

1498
01:19:08,188 --> 01:19:10,029
No, he's wired in.

1499
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:11,030
That's gonna cut into the security deposit.

1500
01:19:14,131 --> 01:19:15,252
Andrew...
Not now.

1501
01:19:15,287 --> 01:19:16,374
Good boy

1502
01:19:20,779 --> 01:19:22,380
- Sean
- Mark.

1503
01:19:22,449 --> 01:19:24,783
- Do you live here?
- Yeah. Do you?

1504
01:19:24,784 --> 01:19:26,636
We were right across the
street, we saw the chimney...

1505
01:19:26,671 --> 01:19:27,017
Yeah

1506
01:19:27,052 --> 01:19:28,060
Is anybody hurt?

1507
01:19:28,095 --> 01:19:31,220
No. You live across the street.

1508
01:19:31,255 --> 01:19:32,417
I'm841 --> 01:19:41,911
You came to California.

1509
01:19:41,946 --> 01:19:43,345
Yeah.

1510
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:45,511
You made the right choice.

1511
01:19:51,398 --> 01:19:52,679
Here you go.

1512
01:19:56,839 --> 01:19:57,674
 Sharon.

1513
01:19:32,452 --> 01:19:35,982
This is my... Sharon. She lives across the street and I was helping her move out when we saw the chimney...

1514
01:19:36,017 --> 01:19:38,806
Yeah, we had a zip line to the pool.

1515
01:19:38,Sharon.

1516
01:20:00,202 --> 01:20:01,560
- I'm so sorry.
- No problem

1517
01:20:01,561 --> 01:20:02,561
I don't know you're gonna...

1518
01:20:02,562 --> 01:20:04,000
- Here you go.
- No, no, wait...

1519
01:20:06,003 --> 01:20:10,743
This house and this team are great.
It's exactly what it should be.

1520
01:20:10,778 --> 01:20:12,061
I'm Sean Parker.

1521
01:20:12,096 --> 01:20:13,310
Oh, he's wired in.

1522
01:20:13,345 --> 01:20:16,700
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1523
01:20:16,735 --> 01:20:18,306
Where's Eduardo?

1524
01:20:18,341 --> 01:20:21,123
He got an internship in New York.

1525
01:20:21,158 --> 01:20:23,525
Eduardo didn't come out?

1526
01:20:43,831 --> 01:20:46,032
I was crashing there for a little bit
while I'm taking care of some things.

1527
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:50,530
But she's done for the sum90 --> 01:20:58,888
Mark.

1528
01:20:59,189 --> 01:21:02,382
I'm sorry, I was looking
at the architecture.

1529
01:21:02,383 --> 01:21:03,521
I asked, "what's your plan for the summer?"

1530
01:21:03,522 --> 01:21:05,123
I hit school bmer
so she's back at her parents place.

1531
01:20:50,565 --> 01:20:52,487
Homeless rockstar of Palo Alto.

1532
01:20:52,488 --> 01:20:53,488
Alright.

1533
01:20:53,489 --> 01:20:55,189
What your plan for the summer?

1534
01:20:57,0y the end of the summer.

1535
01:21:05,124 --> 01:21:07,157
- I'm going to the rest room
- Okay.

1536
01:21:07,158 --> 01:21:08,158
I'll go with you.

1537
01:21:13,098 --> 01:21:14,709
Your date looks so familiar to me.

1538
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:16,154
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

1539
01:21:16,189 --> 01:21:17,747
What do you mean?

1540
01:21:19,924 --> 01:21:23,097
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie.

1541
01:21:23,132 --> 01:21:26,557
But he's too embarrassed to shop
for it at a department store.

1542
01:21:26,592 --> 01:21:30,464
He comes up with an idea for a high end place
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

1543
01:21:30,499 --> 01:21:34,337
He gets a $40,000 bank loan, borrows
another $40,000 from his in-laws,

1544
01:21:34,372 --> 01:21:37,848
Opens a store, and calls it Victoria's Secret.

1545
01:21:37,883 --> 01:21:42,147
Makes a half million dollars his first year.
He starts a catalog, opens three more stores

1546
01:21:42,182 --> 01:21:47,791
And after five years he sells the company to Leslie
Wexner and the Limited for four million dollars.

1547
01:21:47,826 --> 01:21:49,057
Happy ending, right?

1548
01:21:49,058 --> 01:21:53,683
Except two years later, the company's worth 500 million dollars.

1549
01:21:53,718 --> 01:21:57,001
And Roy Raymond jumps off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

1550
01:21:59,541 --> 01:22:02,654
Poor guy just wanted to buy
his wife a pair of thigh highs.

1551
01:22:05,942 --> 01:22:09,855
My date is a Victoria Secret model.
That's why she looks familiar to you.

1552
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,387
Don't be impressed by all of this.

1553
01:22:12,422 --> 01:22:13,590
I read your blog.

1554
01:22:13,625 --> 01:22:15,916
Oh, oh you know, no thats for webprints.

1555
01:22:16,268 --> 01:22:18,126
You know how I started Napster.

1556
01:22:18,161 --> 01:22:20,251
Girl I love in high school.

1557
01:22:20,252 --> 01:22:23,114
Was with the co-captain of
The Varsity Lacrosse team

1558
01:22:23,115 --> 01:22:24,976
And I wanted to take her from him

1559
01:22:24,977 --> 01:22:27,608
So I decided to come up to next big things.

1560
01:22:27,643 --> 01:22:28,646
I didn't know that.

1561
01:22:28,681 --> 01:22:33,705
Napster wasn't the faillure... I changed the music industry for better and for always.

1562
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:37,628
They might not have been a good business but it piss a lot of people off.

1563
01:22:37,663 --> 01:22:43,590
And this now what your facemash about, they scare of my pal,

1564
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:47,868
What the VCs wanna to say, good idea kid, grown up so we could take it from here.

1565
01:22:47,903 --> 01:22:51,516
But not this time, this is our time.

1566
01:22:51,551 --> 01:22:58,101
This time you gonna hand them a business
card that says I'm a CEO... bitch.

1567
01:22:58,136 --> 01:23:00,804
That's what I want from you.

1568
01:23:00,839 --> 01:23:02,773
Where the hell was Eduardo?

1569
01:23:02,808 --> 01:23:04,708
He's in New York.

1570
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:08,674
He's got an...
internship.

1571
01:23:09,781 --> 01:23:12,653
The company's here. A billion dollar company is here.

1572
01:23:12,688 --> 01:23:15,464
Do you live and breathe Facebook.
Yes

1573
01:23:15,499 --> 01:23:18,373
I know you do.

1574
01:23:18,408 --> 01:23:22,936
Eduardo want to be a businessman for all I know he gonna be a good one but he shouldn't be in New York.

1575
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:32,176
And the water under the golden gate is freezing cold.

1576
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:36,987
Look at me face tell me I
don't know what I talkin' about.

1577
01:23:39,471 --> 01:23:41,171
Do you ever thinkin' about that girl...

1578
01:23:41,206 --> 01:23:42,579
What girl?

1579
01:23:42,614 --> 01:23:46,481
The girl from high school with the Lacrosse team...

1580
01:23:47,247 --> 01:23:48,219
No.

1581
01:23:51,766 --> 01:23:53,036
Hundred schools by the end of the summer?

1582
01:23:53,071 --> 01:23:54,331
Yup.

1583
01:23:54,366 --> 01:23:59,694
I tell you what, gesture of a good faith. While you're
getting into a hundred schools, I put you on two continents.

1584
01:24:01,185 --> 01:24:03,446
Two continents.

1585
01:24:07,562 --> 01:24:10,608
If you don't get a place to crash i think
you should definitely come in live with us.

1586
01:24:11,688 --> 01:24:13,638
Let's line-up some shots.

1587
01:24:13,639 --> 01:24:14,639
Excuse me...

1588
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:19,290
- Yes, Sir.
- You can take this away and bring back Don Julio 1942.

1589
01:24:19,325 --> 01:24:21,404
Absolutely, Mr. Carter.

1590
01:26:17,394 --> 01:26:19,087
Thank you.

1591
01:26:19,122 --> 01:26:20,540
And this is my brother Cameron.

1592
01:26:20,575 --> 01:26:22,740
Excellence.

1593
01:26:22,775 --> 01:26:26,349
His Royal Highness, Prince Albert.
Sir, this is Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

1594
01:26:26,384 --> 01:26:29,963
Of course. Brilliant race.
I've never seen a race that close.

1595
01:26:29,998 --> 01:26:34,068
My grandfather, Jack Kelly, was one
of the premiere rowers of his day.

1596
01:26:34,069 --> 01:26:36,070
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years.

1597
01:26:36,071 --> 01:26:38,072
And I've never seen the race that close.

1598
01:26:38,073 --> 01:26:40,172
Have you seen a race that close?
No, your Highness.

1599
01:26:40,173 --> 01:26:43,175
Mile and a half races are more
commonly won by a boat length or two.

1600
01:26:43,176 --> 01:26:46,254
Yes, that's absolutely right.
Brutally close.

1601
01:26:46,289 --> 01:26:47,512
May I introduce my team mates...

1602
01:26:47,547 --> 01:26:49,431
I'm sorry you have to excuse us...
Until the Beijing.

1603
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:56,142
So you flew out here to see that?

1604
01:26:56,143 --> 01:26:57,143
Wouldn't miss you brother.

1605
01:26:57,144 --> 01:26:57,881
How was the royalty?

1606
01:26:57,916 --> 01:27:02,298
I just want him to tell me couple more times,
how close the race was just brutal, brutally-brutally- excruciating.

1607
01:27:04,828 --> 01:27:07,280
Cam. The guy's the prince of a country the size of East Hampton. Relax. Its fine...

1608
01:27:07,315 --> 01:27:08,346
- Boys.
- Dad

1609
01:27:08,381 --> 01:27:09,776
Mr. Winklevoss.

1610
01:27:09,811 --> 01:27:10,785
That was a tough beat.

1611
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,566
I'm sorry You and Mom flew
all over here to see that.

1612
01:27:12,601 --> 01:27:17,699
Don't ever apologize to me for losing a race like that.
Don't ever apologize to anyone for losing a race like that.

1613
01:27:17,734 --> 01:27:18,768
Boys.

1614
01:27:18,803 --> 01:27:19,806
Mr. Kenwright.

1615
01:27:19,841 --> 01:27:22,868
Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright,
head of the host family this week.

1616
01:27:22,903 --> 01:27:24,448
Pleasure to meet you.
Good to meet you.

1617
01:27:24,483 --> 01:27:27,692
I just had a phone chat with my daughter.

1618
01:27:27,727 --> 01:27:29,531
She told me that she and her friends
are all talking about the race,

1619
01:27:29,532 --> 01:27:31,135
Which they just seen by the computer.

1620
01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:35,147
A new website called Facebook.
Do you have this in America?

1621
01:27:37,505 --> 01:27:40,084
I'm going to find your mother...

1622
01:27:41,533 --> 01:27:42,447
is it something wrong?

1623
01:27:42,482 --> 01:27:44,059
Your daughter doesn't go to school in States?

1624
01:27:44,094 --> 01:27:48,320
No, no. Cambridge. Majoring in French Literature,
though I wasn't aware these was such a thing.

1625
01:27:48,355 --> 01:27:49,163
They have Facebook at Cambridge?

1626
01:27:49,164 --> 01:27:53,028
And apparently Oxford and the London School of
Economics because that's where her friends are.

1627
01:27:53,029 --> 01:27:54,029
It's awesome.

1628
01:27:55,031 --> 01:27:58,314
Good race, boys.

1629
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:01,317
I'm gonna go to rest room.

1630
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:08,757
I wanna to see it.

1631
01:28:08,792 --> 01:28:11,045
Stop it, Cam.

1632
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:14,110
Knock it off.

1633
01:28:14,145 --> 01:28:18,896
I don't mind that we loss by the Dutch by less than a second.
That was a good race, that was a fair race.

1634
01:28:18,931 --> 01:28:19,784
And they'll see us again.

1635
01:28:19,819 --> 01:28:26,413
What I mind and what you should mind,
is showing up on Monday for race which run on Sunday.

1636
01:28:26,448 --> 01:28:28,364
We tried talking to him ourselves,
we tried writing a letter,

1637
01:28:28,365 --> 01:28:31,880
We tried the Ad Board, and we tried
talking to the president of the University.

1638
01:28:31,915 --> 01:28:34,472
Now I'm asking you.
For the last time.

1639
01:28:34,473 --> 01:28:40,030
Let's take the considerable resources at
our disposal and sue him in a federal court.

1640
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:42,013
Come on...

1641
01:28:42,048 --> 01:28:43,961
I need a real drink.

1642
01:28:51,732 --> 01:28:52,929
Screw it, let gut that freaking nerd.

1643
01:28:54,261 --> 01:28:56,336
That's what I'm talking about.

1644
01:29:03,031 --> 01:29:05,100
No, I saw him today.

1645
01:29:05,135 --> 01:29:08,592
Maningham, Michael Maningham,
my Chase Equity...

1646
01:29:08,627 --> 01:29:10,591
Are you guys using spike or ghost, miss?

1647
01:29:10,626 --> 01:29:12,365
We don't know, we're just
shooting at each other.

1648
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,019
Use sweet kamikaze.

1649
01:29:14,054 --> 01:29:15,639
Like we know what that is.

1650
01:29:15,944 --> 01:29:19,380
I saw him getting into his turbo carrera,
and he saw me too,

1651
01:29:20,115 --> 01:29:21,352
I know he did.

1652
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:27,117
Don't sweat it...

1653
01:29:27,152 --> 01:29:28,286
Bong hit.

1654
01:29:29,361 --> 01:29:30,945
Is anybody hear that banging?

1655
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:33,310
You don't hear anything,
you are writing code.

1656
01:29:33,345 --> 01:29:35,789
Dude, somebody's at the door.

1657
01:29:44,141 --> 01:29:46,174
I'm gonna call you back.

1658
01:29:47,576 --> 01:29:49,540
- What's up
- What's up?

1659
01:29:51,911 --> 01:29:53,751
Mark was supposed to pick me
up at the airport an hour ago,

1660
01:29:53,752 --> 01:29:55,325
I've been calling his cell.

1661
01:29:55,326 --> 01:29:58,886
He was on a 36 hour coding tear
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

1662
01:30:06,187 --> 01:30:07,211
What happened here?

1663
01:30:07,212 --> 01:30:10,854
Not happened... happening.
The next big thing.

1664
01:30:10,889 --> 01:30:12,407
Wardo!

1665
01:30:12,442 --> 01:30:13,593
Hey man.

1666
01:30:13,628 --> 01:30:14,596
Back to work.

1667
01:30:24,123 --> 01:30:25,199
How old are they, Sean?

1668
01:30:25,234 --> 01:30:27,166
It's not polite to ask.

1669
01:30:27,201 --> 01:30:28,210
How old are they?

1670
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:31,009
You think you know me, right?

1671
01:30:31,044 --> 01:30:32,383
I've read enough.

1672
01:30:32,418 --> 01:30:33,903
You know how much I've read about you?

1673
01:30:35,304 --> 01:30:37,178
Nothing.

1674
01:30:40,426 --> 01:30:41,624
Wardo.

1675
01:30:42,148 --> 01:30:44,184
I waited an hour for you at the airport.

1676
01:30:44,219 --> 01:30:45,567
What time is it?

1677
01:30:45,602 --> 01:30:48,935
It's midnight. Or 3AM in New
York where I just came from.

1678
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:50,728
You've gotta see some of
the new stuff we've got.

1679
01:30:50,829 --> 01:30:53,369
Hey, Dustin, show him the wall.
I'm just calling it the wall.

1680
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:55,906
Forget the wall, tell him about
the meeting I've got set up.

1681
01:30:55,941 --> 01:30:58,216
- You know Peter Thiel?
- No.

1682
01:30:58,251 --> 01:30:59,065
No reason you should.

1683
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:04,162
He just run a two billion dollar
hedge fund called Clarium Capital.

1684
01:31:04,197 --> 01:31:05,533
Why's he setting up meetings?

1685
01:31:05,534 --> 01:31:06,635
Thiel may want to make an angel investment.

1686
01:31:06,636 --> 01:31:09,870
I don't care if he's an actual angel,
why's he setting up business meetings?

1687
01:31:09,905 --> 01:31:11,215
You've had a long flight.

1688
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:12,679
No, I've had long wait
on the tarmac at JFK,

1689
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:16,709
Then a long wait at the passenger
between there was a long flight.

1690
01:31:16,744 --> 01:31:21,973
I run the business end of this company,
he's a house guest living here rent-free

1691
01:31:22,174 --> 01:31:25,375
On a very generous grant from
Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

1692
01:31:25,376 --> 01:31:29,969
I heard about you big ticket advice,
Gerry's tuxedos, Harvard Bartending Course.

1693
01:31:29,970 --> 01:31:33,269
You're just one small step away from
bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.

1694
01:31:42,678 --> 01:31:44,202
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?

1695
01:31:44,237 --> 01:31:45,198
Sure.

1696
01:31:49,731 --> 01:31:52,412
Bong hit!

1697
01:31:54,370 --> 01:31:59,366
How's it going? How's the internship?
How's Christy?

1698
01:31:59,401 --> 01:32:00,742
How's the internship?

1699
01:32:00,777 --> 01:32:01,932
Yeah.

1700
01:32:03,318 --> 01:32:05,297
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.

1701
01:32:05,332 --> 01:32:09,644
We've talked about this on the
phone, we... I quit on my first day.

1702
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:11,921
I do remember you saying that.

1703
01:32:11,956 --> 01:32:13,414
So, how's Christy?

1704
01:32:14,383 --> 01:32:16,095
She's crazy.

1705
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:18,383
Is that fun?

1706
01:32:18,418 --> 01:32:21,091
No. She's actually psychotic.
She's insanely jealous,

1707
01:32:21,092 --> 01:32:24,765
She's irrational and
I'm frightening of her.

1708
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,273
Still, it's nice to have a girlfriend.

1709
01:32:29,762 --> 01:32:33,176
I do not want that guy representing
himself as part of this company.

1710
01:32:33,711 --> 01:32:36,025
You gotta move out here, Wardo,
this is where it's all happening.

1711
01:32:36,026 --> 01:32:38,557
- Did you hear what I just said?
- The connections, the energy...

1712
01:32:38,592 --> 01:32:39,367
Mark...

1713
01:32:39,402 --> 01:32:41,589
I'm afraid if you not come out here.
You gonna left behind.

1714
01:32:41,624 --> 01:32:43,742
I want, I want, I need you.

1715
01:32:43,777 --> 01:32:45,395
Out here, please don't tell me...

1716
01:32:45,396 --> 01:32:46,681
What you just say?

1717
01:32:46,716 --> 01:32:49,385
Its moving faster than
any of us ever imagine...

1718
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:51,156
It's moving fast then Sean think...

1719
01:32:51,157 --> 01:32:52,220
Seans is not part of the company.

1720
01:32:52,221 --> 01:32:54,265
We've got over 300.000 members,
we're in 160 schools...

1721
01:32:54,266 --> 01:32:54,973
I'm aware of that.

1722
01:32:54,974 --> 01:32:55,607
Including five in Europe...

1723
01:32:55,608 --> 01:32:59,022
- I'm aware of that, Mark, I'm the CFO.
- We need more servers than I ever imagined...

1724
01:32:59,057 --> 01:33:00,689
We need more programmers.
And we need more money.

1725
01:33:00,724 --> 01:33:03,375
He set up the Thiel meeting.
He's set up meetings all over town.

1726
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:04,713
He's set up other meetings?
Yes.

1727
01:33:04,748 --> 01:33:05,683
Without me knowing anything about it?!

1728
01:33:05,718 --> 01:33:06,218
You're in New York!

1729
01:33:06,219 --> 01:33:10,648
I'm in New York riding subways
14 hours a day try to find our...

1730
01:33:10,683 --> 01:33:12,069
How's it going so far?!

1731
01:33:16,396 --> 01:33:19,266
What did you mean get left behind?

1732
01:33:24,066 --> 01:33:24,418
Can I help you?

1733
01:33:24,419 --> 01:33:29,638
I'd like to freeze this bank account and
cancel all existing checks and lines of credit.

1734
01:33:31,771 --> 01:33:34,040
May I see some ID please.

1735
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:43,644
- Sean they will be right with you...
- No problem.

1736
01:33:45,939 --> 01:33:48,275
You know this is where they
filmed Towering Inferno.

1737
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:50,086
That's comforting.

1738
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:53,133
Guys... come at my back.

1739
01:33:54,692 --> 01:33:56,878
- She offer you some waters?
- Oh, yeah we're cool.

1740
01:33:58,922 --> 01:34:00,515
Come on in... You must be Mark.

1741
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:02,222
Hi.

1742
01:34:03,995 --> 01:34:05,780
We took a look everything
and congratulations.

1743
01:34:05,815 --> 01:34:10,395
We're gonna start you off
with a $500.000 investment.

1744
01:34:11,130 --> 01:34:14,940
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.

1745
01:34:14,975 --> 01:34:17,163
We'll file as a Corporation
in Delaware and come up...

1746
01:34:17,164 --> 01:34:19,351
With a stock structure
to allow for new investors in.

1747
01:34:19,386 --> 01:34:22,359
Now lemme ask you something.

1748
01:34:22,394 --> 01:34:25,333
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

1749
01:34:44,784 --> 01:34:45,784
Jesus chris...

1750
01:34:49,789 --> 01:34:50,687
When did you get back?

1751
01:34:50,722 --> 01:34:52,037
You scared me. I need you to knock.

1752
01:34:52,038 --> 01:34:54,409
When-did-you-get-back?

1753
01:34:55,409 --> 01:34:57,315
I got back this afternoon.

1754
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:58,892
And when you gonna call me?

1755
01:34:58,927 --> 01:35:01,924
Chris... it was kind of a rough trip
and I was tired and...

1756
01:35:01,959 --> 01:35:05,764
Or answer one of my 47 texts?
Did you know I sent 47 texts?

1757
01:35:05,799 --> 01:35:09,570
I did and I thought that was
incredibly normal behavior.

1758
01:35:09,605 --> 01:35:10,902
Are you mocking me?

1759
01:35:10,937 --> 01:35:13,243
I brought you a present.

1760
01:35:14,305 --> 01:35:16,685
Why does your status say
"single" on your Facebook page?

1761
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,511
What?

1762
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:22,271
Why does your relationship status
say "single" on your Facebook page?

1763
01:35:22,272 --> 01:35:23,777
I was single when I set up the page.

1764
01:35:23,778 --> 01:35:25,248
And you just never
bothered to change it?

1765
01:35:25,449 --> 01:35:25,849
I...

1766
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:27,300
What?!

1767
01:35:27,335 --> 01:35:29,094
I don't know how.

1768
01:35:29,129 --> 01:35:30,835
Do I look stupid to you?

1769
01:35:30,870 --> 01:35:32,246
No. Calm down.

1770
01:35:32,281 --> 01:35:34,787
You're asking me to believe
that the CFO of Facebook,

1771
01:35:34,788 --> 01:35:37,027
Doesn't know how to change his
relationship status on Facebook?

1772
01:35:37,028 --> 01:35:40,615
It's a little embarrassing so you should take it
as as sign of trust that I would tell you that.

1773
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:41,525
Go to hell.

1774
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:42,216
Take it easy.

1775
01:35:42,251 --> 01:35:46,026
You didn't change it so you could screw those
Silicon Valley slut every time you go out to see Mark.

1776
01:35:46,061 --> 01:35:47,140
That is not ever remotely
true and I can promise you...

1777
01:35:47,841 --> 01:35:52,315
That the Silicon Valley Slut don't care what
anyone's relationship status is on Facebook.

1778
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:53,991
Please open your present.

1779
01:35:54,026 --> 01:35:55,183
Your phone does work.

1780
01:35:57,049 --> 01:35:58,539
It's Mark.

1781
01:35:58,574 --> 01:36:01,809
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.
Open your present. It's a silk scarf.

1782
01:36:01,844 --> 01:36:05,044
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

1783
01:36:05,079 --> 01:36:05,989
This'll be your first.

1784
01:36:07,427 --> 01:36:07,907
You froze our account?

1785
01:36:07,942 --> 01:36:09,229
I did.

1786
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:10,482
You froze the account.

1787
01:36:10,517 --> 01:36:11,663
I had to get your attention, Mark.

1788
01:36:11,698 --> 01:36:13,264
Do you realize that you
jeopardized the entire company?

1789
01:36:13,265 --> 01:36:16,365
Do you realize that your actions could've permanently
destroyed everything I've been working on?

1790
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:16,940
WE've been working on.

1791
01:36:16,941 --> 01:36:18,696
Without money, the site can't function.

1792
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:22,335
Ok let me tell you the different between
Facebook and everybody else, we don't crash ever.

1793
01:36:22,336 --> 01:36:26,007
If the servers are down for even a day,
our entire reputation is irreversibly destroy.

1794
01:36:26,042 --> 01:36:26,518
Look...

1795
01:36:26,553 --> 01:36:28,162
Seriously, I think Friendster prove that!

1796
01:36:28,197 --> 01:36:31,394
Even a few people leaving would
reverberate through the entire user base.

1797
01:36:31,429 --> 01:36:33,751
The users are interconnected,
that's the whole point!

1798
01:36:33,786 --> 01:36:35,479
College kids are online because
their friends are online.

1799
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:38,197
And if one domino goes,
the other dominoes go!

1800
01:36:38,198 --> 01:36:40,585
I'm not going back
to the Carribean Night at A-E-Pi.

1801
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:44,767
Holy shit...!

1802
01:36:47,149 --> 01:36:47,924
What's wrong with you!

1803
01:36:47,959 --> 01:36:49,744
Did you like being nobody?!

1804
01:36:49,745 --> 01:36:51,529
Did you like being a joke?
Do you wanna go back to that?!

1805
01:36:51,564 --> 01:36:52,917
Hang on, hang on...

1806
01:36:52,952 --> 01:36:55,838
That was the act of a child, not a decent man.
And it truly wasn't the act of a friend.

1807
01:36:55,873 --> 01:36:59,933
You know how embarrassed I was
when I tried to cash a check today?

1808
01:37:00,116 --> 01:37:02,262
I'm not going back to that life.
Maybe you were frustrated.

1809
01:37:02,297 --> 01:37:04,974
- Maybe you were angry,
- I was.

1810
01:37:04,975 --> 01:37:09,651
But I'm willing to let bygones be
bygones because I've got a good news.

1811
01:37:09,652 --> 01:37:14,558
Look, I'm sorry.
I was angry and maybe it was childish.

1812
01:37:14,593 --> 01:37:17,687
But I had to get your attention.

1813
01:37:17,722 --> 01:37:19,712
Eduardo, I said I've got some good news.

1814
01:37:19,747 --> 01:37:20,520
What is it?

1815
01:37:20,555 --> 01:37:23,135
Peter Thiel just made an angel
investment of a half million dollars.

1816
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:24,205
What?
half million dollars

1817
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:28,645
And he's setting us up in an office.

1818
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:30,265
They want to re-incorporate the company,

1819
01:37:30,266 --> 01:37:33,050
They want to meet you and they need
your signature on some documents.

1820
01:37:33,085 --> 01:37:36,831
So get your ass on the first flight
back to San Fransisco. I need my CFO.

1821
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,406
I'm on my way.

1822
01:37:43,868 --> 01:37:45,015
Wardo.
Yeah.

1823
01:37:45,050 --> 01:37:46,334
We did it.

1824
01:37:49,702 --> 01:37:50,502
Wardo,

1825
01:37:51,504 --> 01:37:53,495
You're going back there already?

1826
01:37:53,496 --> 01:37:55,374
Yes.

1827
01:37:56,597 --> 01:37:59,174
And also I'm breaking up with you.

1828
01:38:07,057 --> 01:38:09,947
Four documents. These first two are
common stock purchase agreements,

1829
01:38:09,982 --> 01:38:16,332
Allowing you to buy stock in the newly re-incorporated
Facebook as supposed the old share which is now worthless.

1830
01:38:16,367 --> 01:38:17,725
The third is the exchange agreement,

1831
01:38:17,726 --> 01:38:22,683
Allowing you to exchanges the old shares for new
shares and then finally voter holding agreement.

1832
01:38:22,718 --> 01:38:25,065
How many shares of stock will I own?

1833
01:38:25,227 --> 01:38:27,592
1.328.334

1834
01:38:27,627 --> 01:38:29,922
Jesus Christ.

1835
01:38:29,957 --> 01:38:35,114
That's a 34,4% ownership share.
Why they increase from the original 30%?

1836
01:38:35,115 --> 01:38:39,264
Because you may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.

1837
01:38:39,299 --> 01:38:40,827
I love working with business majors.

1838
01:38:40,828 --> 01:38:42,128
Economics.

1839
01:38:42,539 --> 01:38:47,174
You should know that Mark's already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

1840
01:38:48,245 --> 01:38:51,980
Well, Mark doesn't care about
money and he needs to be protected.

1841
01:38:54,112 --> 01:38:59,865
Dustin Moskowitz owns 6,81%, Sean Parker 6,47%

1842
01:39:02,028 --> 01:39:02,566
I can live with that.

1843
01:39:02,601 --> 01:39:05,112
And Peter Theil 7%

1844
01:39:08,421 --> 01:39:11,637
Would you like to use my pen?

1845
01:39:11,672 --> 01:39:14,393
Eduardo?

1846
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:16,980
Can you please repeat the question?

1847
01:39:16,981 --> 01:39:19,382
No. It was an outrageously
leading question, the first time.

1848
01:39:19,383 --> 01:39:20,849
Now you want to hear it twice?

1849
01:39:20,884 --> 01:39:22,316
Would you re-read that please?

1850
01:39:22,351 --> 01:39:24,122
Go ahead.

1851
01:39:24,157 --> 01:39:25,836
And when you signed these documents,

1852
01:39:25,837 --> 01:39:28,740
Were you aware that you were
signing your own death certificate?

1853
01:39:28,775 --> 01:39:30,184
No.

1854
01:39:33,942 --> 01:39:38,186
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyer look over all the... uh,

1855
01:39:38,221 --> 01:39:41,052
In all honesty I thought
they were my lawyers.

1856
01:39:44,568 --> 01:39:50,505
I was your only friend.
You had one friend.

1857
01:39:53,933 --> 01:39:55,533
My father won't even look at me.

1858
01:39:55,568 --> 01:40:00,034
Okay. Eduardo. Did Mr. Zuckerberg saying
anything to you after you signed the papers?

1859
01:40:00,069 --> 01:40:04,941
There was a lot of handshaking
and a lot of congratulations.

1860
01:40:04,976 --> 01:40:09,006
He'd already told me he wouldn't be coming
back to school for at least a semester.

1861
01:40:09,007 --> 01:40:12,771
So we were saying goodbye for a while.

1862
01:40:12,772 --> 01:40:14,031
And then before I left,
he said...

1863
01:40:14,032 --> 01:40:15,577
But you gotta come back.

1864
01:40:15,578 --> 01:40:17,822
Somewhere around the end
of November or early December.

1865
01:40:17,857 --> 01:40:20,221
Peter wanna throw us an amazing
party when we hit a million members,

1866
01:40:20,222 --> 01:40:22,662
It's gonna be out of control.
You gotta come back for it.

1867
01:40:22,697 --> 01:40:24,181
A million members.

1868
01:40:24,216 --> 01:40:25,294
Yeah.

1869
01:40:25,329 --> 01:40:29,637
The algorithm on the window at Kirkland?

1870
01:40:29,672 --> 01:40:31,312
Yeah.

1871
01:40:34,453 --> 01:40:36,472
Yeah, I'll be here.

1872
01:40:40,776 --> 01:40:42,980
- You sure about this?
- You're 20 mins late.

1873
01:40:42,981 --> 01:40:45,684
You're gonna walk in there and say you overslept
and you didn't have time to get dressed.

1874
01:40:45,685 --> 01:40:46,724
They're gonna pitch you.

1875
01:40:46,725 --> 01:40:49,798
Chase equity is going to pitch you.
They're gonna beg you to take their money.

1876
01:40:49,799 --> 01:40:54,677
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod, you're gonna nod
and then you're gonna say, "Which one of you is Ralph"

1877
01:40:54,678 --> 01:40:57,507
No, not Ralph... No Manningham.
Which one of you, Michael Manningham?

1878
01:40:57,542 --> 01:40:58,848
And he'll say I am.

1879
01:40:58,883 --> 01:41:03,352
Then you'll say, Sean Parker says "F*ck You."
Walk out.

1880
01:41:03,875 --> 01:41:04,701
Okay.

1881
01:41:17,873 --> 01:41:22,160
In late November I got the e-mail from Mark
telling me to come out for the millionth member party.

1882
01:41:22,195 --> 01:41:23,996
What else did e-mail say?

1883
01:41:24,031 --> 01:41:27,131
It said that we had to
have a business meeting.

1884
01:41:27,166 --> 01:41:31,119
That Mark and Sean had playing some
kind of revenge stunt to Chase Equity.

1885
01:41:31,154 --> 01:41:36,696
Manningham was so impressed that he was makin'
an investment offer that was hard to turn down.

1886
01:41:36,731 --> 01:41:41,101
I went out to California and I
went straight to the New Offices.

1887
01:41:41,136 --> 01:41:48,068
I didn't know whether to dress for the party or
the business meeting so I kinda dressed for both.

1888
01:41:48,103 --> 01:41:48,866
But it didn't matter.

1889
01:41:48,867 --> 01:41:49,867
Why not?

1890
01:41:49,902 --> 01:41:52,340
Because I wasn't called
out there for either one...

1891
01:41:52,375 --> 01:41:53,920
What were you called out there for?

1892
01:41:57,673 --> 01:41:59,478
An ambush.

1893
01:41:59,513 --> 01:42:01,565
Mr. Saverin. Hi...

1894
01:42:13,025 --> 01:42:17,645
At first I thought he was joking,
giving me more contracts to sign.

1895
01:42:21,146 --> 01:42:23,866
But then I started reading.

1896
01:42:26,376 --> 01:42:28,677
What is this?

1897
01:42:28,712 --> 01:42:31,504
Well, as you know we had
some new investor that...

1898
01:42:31,539 --> 01:42:33,710
What is this?

1899
01:42:49,071 --> 01:42:50,071
Mark...

1900
01:42:51,574 --> 01:42:52,374
MARK...!

1901
01:42:52,375 --> 01:42:53,507
- He's wired in.
- Sorry

1902
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:54,121
He's wired in.

1903
01:42:54,122 --> 01:42:54,622
- Is he?
- Yes.

1904
01:42:56,794 --> 01:42:58,706
How about now, you still wired in?

1905
01:42:58,741 --> 01:42:59,480
Call security!

1906
01:42:59,515 --> 01:43:02,994
You issued over 24-million
new shares of stock.

1907
01:43:03,029 --> 01:43:04,816
You were told that if new
investors came along...

1908
01:43:04,817 --> 01:43:07,710
How much your shares are diluted?
How much are his?!

1909
01:43:07,711 --> 01:43:12,403
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?

1910
01:43:12,438 --> 01:43:13,430
It wasn't.

1911
01:43:13,431 --> 01:43:16,748
What was Mr. Moskowitz's
ownership share diluted down to?

1912
01:43:16,749 --> 01:43:17,749
It wasn't.

1913
01:43:17,855 --> 01:43:21,390
What was Sean Parker's
ownership share diluted down to?

1914
01:43:21,391 --> 01:43:22,546
It wasn't.

1915
01:43:22,547 --> 01:43:25,451
What was Peter Thiels's
ownership share diluted down to?

1916
01:43:25,452 --> 01:43:26,702
It wasn't.

1917
01:43:26,703 --> 01:43:30,683
What was your ownership share diluted down to?

1918
01:43:30,684 --> 01:43:32,865
Point-zero-three-percent.

1919
01:43:41,036 --> 01:43:42,561
You signed the papers.

1920
01:43:42,596 --> 01:43:43,795
You set me up.

1921
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:46,102
You blame me because you were
the business head of the company,

1922
01:43:46,103 --> 01:43:48,067
And you made a bad business
deal with your own company?!

1923
01:43:48,068 --> 01:43:49,755
It's gonna be like I'm not part of Facebook.

1924
01:43:49,756 --> 01:43:52,525
It won't be like you're not a part of Facebook,
You're not part of Facebook.

1925
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,628
My name's on the masthead.

1926
01:43:53,663 --> 01:43:55,073
You may wanna check again.

1927
01:43:55,108 --> 01:43:56,506
This is because I froze the account?

1928
01:43:56,541 --> 01:43:58,570
You think we were gonna let you
parade around in your ridiculous suits,

1929
01:43:58,605 --> 01:44:00,090
Pretending you were running this company?

1930
01:44:00,125 --> 01:44:02,056
Sorry, my Prada is at the cleaners,

1931
01:44:02,091 --> 01:44:06,413
Along with my hoodie and my 'F*ck You' Flip-Flops,
you pretentious douche bag!

1932
01:44:06,414 --> 01:44:07,841
Security is here.
You'll be leaving now.

1933
01:44:07,842 --> 01:44:09,034
I'm not signing those papers.

1934
01:44:09,035 --> 01:44:11,184
We will get your signature.

1935
01:44:11,185 --> 01:44:13,795
Tell me this isn't about me
getting into the Phoenix.

1936
01:44:16,107 --> 01:44:20,216
You... you did it. I knew you did it.
You planted the story about the chicken.

1937
01:44:20,217 --> 01:44:21,835
I didn't planted the
story about the chicken.

1938
01:44:21,836 --> 01:44:23,879
What he talking about?

1939
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:25,278
Seriously, what the hell with the chicken?

1940
01:44:25,279 --> 01:44:27,453
And I'll bet what you hated the most,

1941
01:44:27,454 --> 01:44:31,227
They said they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.

1942
01:44:31,262 --> 01:44:34,134
Which I am!
You better lawyer-up, asshole,

1943
01:44:34,135 --> 01:44:40,434
'Cause I'm not comin' back for 30%
I'm comin' back for everything!

1944
01:44:44,932 --> 01:44:46,383
Get him outta here.

1945
01:44:46,418 --> 01:44:48,700
It's okay. I'm going.

1946
01:44:49,836 --> 01:44:51,136
Hang on...

1947
01:44:53,428 --> 01:44:54,929
Almost forgot.

1948
01:44:55,931 --> 01:44:57,532
Here's your $19.000.

1949
01:44:57,533 --> 01:44:59,934
I wouldn't cash it though.
I drew it on the account you froze.

1950
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:08,199
I like standing next to you, Sean.

1951
01:45:09,093 --> 01:45:11,589
It makes me look so tough.

1952
01:45:26,304 --> 01:45:27,493
That's it. That's our
show for tonight, people.

1953
01:45:29,331 --> 01:45:31,582
Look, I want to see everybody here
get geared up for a party.

1954
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:34,030
We're gonna walk down to the
club like it's the Macy's Parade.

1955
01:45:34,065 --> 01:45:36,782
Mackey, put it up on the big
screen, we've gotta almost be there.

1956
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:41,958
- You alright?
- Yeah.

1957
01:45:43,063 --> 01:45:44,959
You were kinda rough on him.

1958
01:45:44,994 --> 01:45:47,121
That's life in the NFL.

1959
01:45:47,641 --> 01:45:49,175
No. You didn't have to be that rough on him.

1960
01:45:49,210 --> 01:45:50,710
Sean...

1961
01:45:52,495 --> 01:45:54,213
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

1962
01:45:54,248 --> 01:45:55,896
He almost killed it!

1963
01:45:55,931 --> 01:46:00,933
I'll send flowers.

1964
01:46:00,968 --> 01:46:05,834
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together
a party after party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

1965
01:46:05,835 --> 01:46:07,550
Ashleigh there's a sister.

1966
01:46:07,585 --> 01:46:08,578
Ashleigh.

1967
01:46:08,613 --> 01:46:09,320
The Intern.

1968
01:46:09,321 --> 01:46:11,322
I know who she is.

1969
01:46:11,357 --> 01:46:12,842
Are you guys?

1970
01:46:12,843 --> 01:46:14,860
Ashleigh and me... no...
A little bit.

1971
01:46:17,370 --> 01:46:18,293
Why?

1972
01:46:18,328 --> 01:46:20,209
Excuse me, Mark.

1973
01:46:20,244 --> 01:46:21,882
We were just talkin' about you,

1974
01:46:21,917 --> 01:46:23,864
You're doing a really good job.

1975
01:46:24,246 --> 01:46:26,192
Thanks. I appreciate that.

1976
01:46:27,494 --> 01:46:28,471
This came in for you.

1977
01:46:28,506 --> 01:46:31,432
Put on my desk.

1978
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:38,876
What's the package.

1979
01:46:38,911 --> 01:46:40,702
Nothing.

1980
01:46:42,503 --> 01:46:43,599
Mackey...

1981
01:46:43,634 --> 01:46:44,195
Yes, Sir.

1982
01:46:44,196 --> 01:46:45,182
Refresh!

1983
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,422
And you need a hugger, I know.

1984
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:01,285
1 millions, who's got champagne?

1985
01:47:29,024 --> 01:47:34,956
...A pic sharing application.

1986
01:47:34,991 --> 01:47:38,218
It is the true digitalization of your life.

1987
01:47:40,878 --> 01:47:44,640
You don't just go to a party anymore,
you go to a party with your digital camera,

1988
01:47:44,675 --> 01:47:48,307
And then your friends re-live the
party online. And tagging. The idea...

1989
01:47:48,342 --> 01:47:50,201
Would this be easier without the bra?

1990
01:47:50,236 --> 01:47:51,515
It's worth finding out.

1991
01:47:59,417 --> 01:48:01,285
Stop the music, now!

1992
01:48:06,075 --> 01:48:08,321
I've spent hours...
watching what people do when they log on

1993
01:48:08,356 --> 01:48:10,103
They check friends status update,

1994
01:48:10,138 --> 01:48:11,064
That's weird, why the music off...

1995
01:48:11,065 --> 01:48:14,348
Checked to see which of their friends had changed
their profiles, changed their photos and mostly...

1996
01:48:14,383 --> 01:48:15,983
Seriously, what happen with the music

1997
01:48:15,984 --> 01:48:20,201
We lived on farms, and then we lived in
cities and now we're going to live on internet

1998
01:48:20,202 --> 01:48:24,050
Sean. Stop, I think
something's goin' on downstairs.

1999
01:48:34,641 --> 01:48:36,041
Please... Time to go home!

2000
01:48:37,957 --> 01:48:39,277
Party is over.

2001
01:48:43,202 --> 01:48:44,357
It's the cops!

2002
01:48:44,392 --> 01:48:45,444
Shit.

2003
01:48:50,049 --> 01:48:51,828
Good to see you officer...
What can I do for you.

2004
01:48:53,436 --> 01:48:54,432
What's goin' on?

2005
01:48:54,467 --> 01:48:56,751
Was the music too loud?
We were havin' celebration.

2006
01:48:56,786 --> 01:48:58,586
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.

2007
01:48:58,621 --> 01:49:00,389
I can tell them to turn the music down...

2008
01:49:05,197 --> 01:49:06,409
That's not mine.

2009
01:49:06,835 --> 01:49:09,863
Ok, we gonna need identification,
keep your hand where we can see 'em

2010
01:49:11,473 --> 01:49:13,043
Anything else in your pocket,
I should know about?

2011
01:49:13,078 --> 01:49:14,104
No, Sir.
No.

2012
01:49:14,139 --> 01:49:16,677
- Don't be stupid now.
- I don't, I...

2013
01:49:21,222 --> 01:49:22,933
What this

2014
01:49:22,968 --> 01:49:24,662
That's an Epipen.

2015
01:49:26,236 --> 01:49:28,476
- And this?
- That's my inhaler.

2016
01:49:29,390 --> 01:49:31,030
How old are you?

2017
01:49:35,140 --> 01:49:35,931
I'm 21

2018
01:49:35,966 --> 01:49:38,458
Lying only would make it worst!

2019
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:42,032
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

2020
01:49:52,910 --> 01:49:57,084
- Hello?
- Listen, something's happen...

2021
01:50:03,649 --> 01:50:04,649
Shit.

2022
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:07,412
It's alright, it's gonna be alright.
I've posted bond.

2023
01:50:07,447 --> 01:50:12,061
I wasn't doing anything.
I mean, I've got allergies...

2024
01:50:15,649 --> 01:50:18,563
- Interns...
- It was just a party

2025
01:50:20,968 --> 01:50:23,996
This gonna be news, Sean.
It's gonna be online, any second.

2026
01:50:26,316 --> 01:50:27,431
I know.

2027
01:50:27,466 --> 01:50:28,327
You know with an intern...

2028
01:50:28,328 --> 01:50:30,693
It's cool, I have it under control

2029
01:50:30,694 --> 01:50:31,648
I will get it under control.

2030
01:50:32,526 --> 01:50:34,988
I will call someone
and see what the next move is.

2031
01:50:34,989 --> 01:50:37,308
But this gonna be news now.

2032
01:50:37,316 --> 01:50:39,276
You don't think Eduardo was involve, do you?

2033
01:50:40,243 --> 01:50:41,343
- Do you think?
- No.

2034
01:50:42,579 --> 01:50:47,522
Or Manningham, one of them, somebody,
somebody sent the cocain there, 'cause it got in there.

2035
01:50:47,523 --> 01:50:49,524
You believe me, it's gonna be fine...

2036
01:50:53,529 --> 01:50:54,529
Right?

2037
01:50:58,034 --> 01:51:01,385
Go home Sean.

2038
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:15,550
Mark...

2039
01:51:18,554 --> 01:51:19,554
Mark...

2040
01:51:21,557 --> 01:51:23,603
We're done for the day

2041
01:51:23,638 --> 01:51:26,748
Yeah, I was just sittin'...

2042
01:51:29,538 --> 01:51:31,988
What happened to Sean?

2043
01:51:32,023 --> 01:51:34,439
He still owns 7% of the company.

2044
01:51:38,878 --> 01:51:41,940
All you had all day only was that salad,
you wanna get something to eat?

2045
01:51:41,975 --> 01:51:44,599
I can't.

2046
01:51:51,759 --> 01:51:53,432
I'm not a bad guy.

2047
01:51:53,433 --> 01:51:54,414
I know that.

2048
01:51:55,213 --> 01:51:58,374
Under emotional testimony,
I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.

2049
01:51:59,376 --> 01:52:00,376
- And the other 15?
- Purgery

2050
01:52:01,894 --> 01:52:03,379
Creations myth needs a devil.

2051
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:08,086
What happens now?

2052
01:52:09,549 --> 01:52:13,998
Sy and the others are having
a steak on University Avenue.

2053
01:52:14,099 --> 01:52:15,910
Then they'll come back up to the office...

2054
01:52:15,911 --> 01:52:18,522
And start working on a settlement
agreement to present to you.

2055
01:52:19,086 --> 01:52:20,095
They're gonna settle?

2056
01:52:20,096 --> 01:52:22,961
Oh yeah... and you're gonna
have to pay a little extra.

2057
01:52:23,362 --> 01:52:23,996
Why?

2058
01:52:23,997 --> 01:52:26,739
So that these guy sign an
non-disclosure agreement.

2059
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:29,777
They say one unflattering word about you
in public, you own their wife and kids.

2060
01:52:30,731 --> 01:52:31,752
I invented Facebook

2061
01:52:31,984 --> 01:52:33,837
I'm talking about what a jury.

2062
01:52:33,872 --> 01:52:36,495
I specialize in voir dire...
Jury selection.

2063
01:52:36,530 --> 01:52:38,283
What a jury sees when
they look at the defendant.

2064
01:52:38,318 --> 01:52:41,583
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likability...

2065
01:52:41,618 --> 01:52:42,811
Like-ability?

2066
01:52:42,846 --> 01:52:45,876
I've been licensed to practice
law for all of 20 months.

2067
01:52:45,911 --> 01:52:47,023
And I can get the jury to believe...

2068
01:52:47,024 --> 01:52:49,736
That you planted the story
about Eduardo and the chicken.

2069
01:52:49,837 --> 01:52:50,837
Watch, what else?

2070
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:54,343
Why weren't you at Sean's
sorority party that night?

2071
01:52:54,378 --> 01:52:55,595
You think I'm the one
that called the police?

2072
01:52:55,596 --> 01:52:58,566
Doesn't matter, I ask the question,
now everybody's think about it

2073
01:52:58,567 --> 01:53:01,036
You've lost your jury
in the first 10 mins.

2074
01:53:02,891 --> 01:53:04,127
- Farm animals?
- Yeah.

2075
01:53:04,162 --> 01:53:08,549
I was drunk, and angry and stupid.

2076
01:53:08,550 --> 01:53:10,738
- And blogging...
- and blogging.

2077
01:53:12,126 --> 01:53:16,577
Pay them, on the scheme of things.
It's a speeding ticket.

2078
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,250
That what Sy will tell you tomorrow.

2079
01:53:21,366 --> 01:53:24,100
Do you think anybody would mind if I
stay and use the computer for a minute...

2080
01:53:24,135 --> 01:53:25,746
I can't imagine that would be a problem.

2081
01:53:25,781 --> 01:53:26,756
Thanks.

2082
01:53:28,048 --> 01:53:30,160
I appreciate your help today.

2083
01:53:34,171 --> 01:53:36,640
You're not an asshole Mark...

2084
01:53:37,656 --> 01:53:39,607
You're just trying so hard to be...

2085
01:54:37,575 --> 01:54:43,717
Cameroon and Tyler Winklevoss received a settlement of
65 million dollars and signed a non-disclosure agreement.

2086
01:54:47,655 --> 01:54:53,805
They rowed for the U.S. Olympic Team in Beijing and placed sixth.

2087
01:55:04,878 --> 01:55:11,166
Eduardo Saverin received an unknown settlement. His name
has been restored to the Facebook masthead as a Co-Founder.

2088
01:55:15,067 --> 01:55:20,656
Facebook has 500 million members in 207 countries.
It's currently valued at 25 billion dollars.

2089
01:55:31,939 --> 01:55:36,806
