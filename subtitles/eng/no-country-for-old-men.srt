2
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,220
I was sheriff of this county
when I was twenty-five years old.

3
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,820
Hard to believe.

4
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,500
Grandfather was a lawman. Father too.

5
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,180
Me and him was sheriff at the same
time, him up in Plano and me out here.

6
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,740
I think he was pretty proud of that.

7
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,140
I know I was.

8
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,740
Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.

9
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,700
A lot of folks find that hard to believe.

10
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:07,340
Jim Scarborough never carried one.

11
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,420
That the younger Jim.

12
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,980
Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear
one up in Commanche County.

13
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,100
Now I always liked to
hear about the old-timers.

14
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,140
Never missed a chance to do so.

15
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,540
You can't help but compare
yourself against the old-timers.

16
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,420
Can't help but wonder how they
would've operated these times.

17
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,620
There is this boy I sent to the electric
chair in Huntsville here a while back.

18
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,540
My arrest and my testimony.

19
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,460
He killed a
fourteen-year-old girl.

20
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,780
Papers said it was a crime of passion but
he told me there wasn't any passion to it.

21
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,700
Told me that he'd been planning to kill some-
body for about as long as he could remember.

22
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:53,780
Said if they turned him out he'd do it again.

23
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,780
Said he knew he was going to hell.

24
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,820
Be there in about fifteen minutes.

25
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,060
I don't know what to make of that.

26
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,940
I surely don't.

27
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,780
The crime you see now, it's
hard to even take its measure.

28
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,620
It's not that I'm afraid of it.

29
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,180
I always knew you had to be
willing to die to even do this job.

30
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,060
But I don't want to push my chips forward...

31
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,380
...and go out and meet
something I don't understand.

32
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,180
A man would have to put his soul at hazard.

33
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,900
He just have to say, okay.

34
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,820
I'll be part of this world.

35
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,940
Yes sir, I just walked in the door.

36
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,740
Sheriff he had some sort
of thing on him like a...

37
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,420
...oxygen tanks for emphysema or something.

38
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,140
And a hose that run down his sleeve...

39
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,905
You got me.

40
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,860
You'll look at it when you get in.

41
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,540
Yes sir, I got it under control.

42
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,745
Howdy, what's this about?

43
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,260
Step out of the car please, sir.

44
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,580
What is it?

45
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,300
I need you to step out of the car, sir.

46
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,340
What is that for?

47
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,220
Would you hold still please, sir.

48
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,260
Hold still.

49
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,860
Agua.

50
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,420
...Agua. Por Dios.

51
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,940
Agua.

52
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,220
I ain't got no water.

53
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,780
Agua.

54
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,340
I ain't got no agua.

55
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,580
You speak English?

56
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,420
Where's the last guy?

57
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,545
Ultimo hombre.

58
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,380
Last man standing. There must've been one.

59
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:20,140
Where'd he go?

60
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,260
I reckon I'd go out the way I came in.

61
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,380
La puerta...

62
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,420
Hay lobos...

63
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,220
Ain't no lobos.

64
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,660
If you stopped and watch your backtrack,
you're gonna shoot my dumb ass.

65
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,700
But if you stopped, you stopped in the shade.

66
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,100
What's in the satchel?

67
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,540
It's full of money.

68
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,700
That'll be the day.

69
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,300
Where'd you get the pistol?

70
00:14:35,335 --> 00:14:36,620
At the gettin' place.

71
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,140
Did you buy that gun?

72
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,860
No. I found it.

73
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,020
Welyn!

74
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:44,785
What?

75
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,900
Quit your hollering.

76
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,460
What'd you give for that thing?

77
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,340
You don't need to know everything, Carla Jean.

78
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,740
I need to know that.

79
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,900
You keep running that mouth of yours I'm
gonna take you in the back and screw you.

80
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,900
Big talk.

81
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,180
Keep it up.

82
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,140
Fine. I don't wanna know.

83
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,980
I don't even wanna know
where you been all day.

84
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,180
That'll work.

85
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,540
Alright.

86
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,380
Llewelyn.

87
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,740
Yeah?

88
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,380
What're you doing, baby?

89
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,500
I'm going out.

90
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,620
Going where?

91
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,860
Something I forgot to do but I'll be back.

92
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,105
What're you going to do?

93
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,820
I'm fixing to do something
dumber now but I'm going anyways.

94
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,660
If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.

95
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,860
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

96
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,620
Well then. I'll tell her myself.

97
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,700
How much?

98
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,380
Sixty-nine cents.

99
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,980
And the gas.

100
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,940
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

101
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,580
What way would that be?

102
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,300
I seen you was from Dallas.

103
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:19,420
What business is it of yours
where I'm from, friendo?

104
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,580
I didn't mean nothing by it.

105
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,100
Didn't mean nothing.

106
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,580
Just passing my time.

107
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,220
If you don't wanna accept that I
don't know what else I can do for you.

108
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,820
Will there be something else?

109
00:21:37,855 --> 00:21:39,180
I don't know. Will there?

110
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,420
Is somethin wrong?

111
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:48,197
With what?

112
00:21:48,232 --> 00:21:48,940
With anything?

113
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,980
Is that what you're asking me?

114
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,540
Is there something wrong with anything?

115
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,500
Will there be anything else?

116
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,580
You already asked me that.

117
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,780
Well... I need to see about closing.

118
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,460
See about closing.

119
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,025
Yes sir.

120
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,140
What time do you close?

121
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:08,377
Now. We close now.

122
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:09,545
Now is not a time.

123
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,780
What time do you close?

124
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,540
Generally around dark. At dark.

125
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,380
You don't know what you're
talking about, do you?

126
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:19,980
Sir?

127
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,980
I said you don't know
what you're talking about.

128
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,260
What time do you go to bed?

129
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,460
Sir?

130
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,380
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?

131
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:34,100
I said what time do you go to bed?

132
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,100
Somewhere around 9:30.

133
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,280
I'd say around 9:30.

134
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:43,825
I could come back then.

135
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,180
Why would you be coming back?

136
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:46,145
We'd be closed.

137
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,180
Yeah. You said that.

138
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,185
Well... I got to close now.

139
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,780
You live in that house out back?

140
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,900
Yes I do.

141
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,220
You lived here all your life?

142
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,620
This is my wife's father's place. Originally.

143
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,340
You married into it.

144
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,700
We lived in Temple Texas for many years.

145
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,620
Raised a family there.

146
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,625
In Temple.

147
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,780
We come out here about four years ago.

148
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,620
You married into it.

149
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,900
If that's the way you wanna put it.

150
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,860
I don't have some way to put it.

151
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,060
That's the way it is.

152
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,820
What's the most you've
ever lost in a coin toss?

153
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,665
Sir?

154
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,020
The most you ever lost in a coin toss.

155
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,780
I don't know. I couldn't say.

156
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,740
Call it.

157
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:50,980
Call it?

158
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,620
Yes.

159
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,940
For what?

160
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,980
Just call it.

161
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,780
Well, we need to know what
we're calling it for here.

162
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:01,820
You need to call it.

163
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,580
I can't call it for you.

164
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,660
It wouldn't be fair.

165
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,340
I didn't put nothing up.

166
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,620
Yes, you did.

167
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,940
You've been putting it up your whole life.

168
00:24:10,975 --> 00:24:12,020
You just didn't know it.

169
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,180
You know what date is on this coin?

170
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,420
No.

171
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,380
1958.

172
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,500
It's been traveling
twenty-two years to get here.

173
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,980
And now it's here.

174
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,340
And it's either heads or tails.

175
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,100
And you have to say. Call it.

176
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,460
Look... I need to know what I stand to win.

177
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,620
Everything.

178
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,465
How's that?

179
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,660
You stand to win everything. Call it.

180
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,580
Alright. Heads then.

181
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,260
Well done.

182
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,580
Don't put it in your pocket.

183
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,585
Sir?

184
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,660
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

185
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,060
Where you want me to put it?

186
00:24:59,095 --> 00:25:00,180
Anywhere not in your pocket.

187
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,500
Or it'll be mixed in with the
others and become just a coin.

188
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,540
Which it is.

189
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,380
Llewelyn?

190
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,260
What the hell?

191
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,340
Odessa.

192
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,540
Why would we go to Odessa?

193
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,500
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.

194
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,180
Well, how come?

195
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,545
Right now it's midnight Sunday.

196
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,745
When the courthouse opens
nine hours from now...

197
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,180
...someone's gonna be callin' in the vehicle
number on the inspection plate on the truck.

198
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,660
And by 9:30, they'll show up here.

199
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,665
But for how long do we have to...

200
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,940
Baby, at what point would you quit bothering
to look for your two million dollars?

201
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,740
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

202
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,220
Try standin'' in the door
and holler "Mama, I'm home".

203
00:25:58,255 --> 00:25:58,985
Llewelyn...

204
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,905
C'mon, pack your things.

205
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,580
Anything you leave you
ain't gonna see it again.

206
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,300
Well, thanks for falling
all over and apologizing.

207
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,140
Baby, things happened. I can't take 'em back.

208
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,740
Mind ridin', bitch?

209
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,100
This his truck?

210
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,140
Mm-Mm.

211
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,500
Got a screwgie?

212
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,705
Who cut his tires?

213
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,380
Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

214
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,220
That's a dead dog.

215
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,380
Yes, it is.

216
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,500
Where's the receiver?

217
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,660
I've got it.

218
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,780
They're ripe petunias.

219
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,660
Hold this please.

220
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,180
You want it?

221
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,860
You getting anything though?

222
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,660
Not a bleep.

223
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,820
Alright...

224
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,020
Gimme that.

225
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
I thought it was a car afire.

226
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:57,465
It is a car afire.

227
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,780
But Wnedell said there was
something backcountry too.

228
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,100
When is the county gonna start
paying a rental on my horse?

229
00:28:05,135 --> 00:28:06,580
I love you more and more everyday.

230
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,980
That's very nice.

231
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,240
Be careful.

232
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:10,820
Always am.

233
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,020
Don't get hurt.

234
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:12,820
Never do.

235
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,180
Don't hurt no one.

236
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,260
If you say so.

237
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,940
Wouldn't think a car would burn like that.

238
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,465
Yes sir. We should've brought weenies.

239
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,100
That look like about a
'77 Ford to you, Wendell?

240
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,505
It could be.

241
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,580
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

242
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,460
The old boy shot by the highway?

243
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,820
Yes sir, his vehicle.

244
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,500
Man killed Lamar's deputy and took his car.

245
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:14,940
Killed that man on the highway...

246
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:16,265
...swapped for his car...

247
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,740
...and now here it is and he's
swapped again for god knows what.

248
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,700
That's very linear, Sheriff.

249
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,745
Well. Old age flattens a man.

250
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,420
Yes sir. But then there's this other.

251
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,060
You ride Winston.

252
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,340
- You sure?
- Oh, I'm more than sure.

253
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,025
Anything happens to
Loretta's horse out here...

254
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,020
...I can tell you right now I don't
wanna be the party that was aboard.

255
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,100
It's the same tire tread comin back as going.

256
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,500
Made about the same time too.
You can see the sides real clear.

257
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,780
Somebodies pried the inspection
plate off the door on this one.

258
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,220
I know this truck.

259
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,700
Belongs to a fella named Moss.

260
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,380
- Llewelyn Moss?
- That's the boy.

261
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,740
You figure him for a dope-runner?

262
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:09,460
I don't know but I kindly doubt it.

263
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,740
Restul sunt acolo.

264
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,180
Oh hell's bells, they even shot the dog.

265
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,900
Well this is just a deal gone wrong, isn't it?

266
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:25,900
Yeah, appears to have been a glitch or two.

267
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,000
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?

268
00:30:33,035 --> 00:30:36,140
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.

269
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,820
Somebody unloaded on
that thing with a shotgun.

270
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,580
How come do you reckon the
coyotes ain't been at 'em?

271
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:47,420
I don't know.

272
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,380
Supposedly coyotes won't eat a Mexican.

273
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,300
These boys appear to be managerial.

274
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,180
I think we're lookin at
more than one fracas...

275
00:31:01,215 --> 00:31:02,665
Execution here...

276
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,620
...Wild West over there

277
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,040
That Mexican brown dope.

278
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,145
These boys is all swole up.

279
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,140
So this was earlier, getting set to trade.

280
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,620
Then, whoa, differences...

281
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,300
You know might not of even been no money.

282
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,820
That's possible.

283
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,660
But you don't believe it.

284
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,180
No. Probably I don't.

285
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,500
Well, it's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?

286
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,100
If it ain't, it'll do till a mess gets here.

287
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,380
Yes sir?

288
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,380
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.

289
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,500
Did you go up to his trailer?

290
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,340
Yes.

291
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,180
Well, I'd say he's at work.
Do you want to leave a message?

292
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,300
Where does he work?

293
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,900
I can't say.

294
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,745
Where does he work?

295
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,220
Sir, I ain't at liberty to give out
no information about our residents.

296
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,025
Where does he work?

297
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:59,540
Did you not hear me? We
can't give out no information.

298
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,705
Why all the way to Del Rio?

299
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,100
I'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

300
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,700
You can't afford one?

301
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,145
I don't wanna register it.

302
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,980
Look, I'll call you in a couple days.

303
00:34:32,015 --> 00:34:34,060
- Promise?
- Yes, I do.

304
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,025
I got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.

305
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,580
Well I got a good one.
So, they ought to even out.

306
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,940
Quit worrying so much.

307
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,940
Mama's gonna raise hell.

308
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,540
She is just gonna curse you up and down.

309
00:34:47,575 --> 00:34:49,505
You should be used to that.

310
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,460
I'm used to lots of
things, I work at Wal-Mart.

311
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,940
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.

312
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,660
- Llewelyn?
- Yes ma'am?

313
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:05,340
- You are comin back, ain't ya?
- I shall return.

314
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,100
Sheriff's Department!

315
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,700
Look at that lock.

316
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,880
We goin' in?

317
00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:21,260
Gun out and up.

318
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,980
- What about yours?
- I'm hidin behind you.

319
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,740
Sheriff's Department!

320
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,860
I believe they've lit a shuck.

321
00:36:00,895 --> 00:36:02,337
I believe you're right.

322
00:36:02,372 --> 00:36:03,780
That from the lock?

323
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,820
Probably must be.

324
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,460
When was he here, Sheriff?

325
00:36:07,495 --> 00:36:08,185
I don't know.

326
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,380
Oh. Now that's aggravating.

327
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,385
Sheriff?

328
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,980
Still sweating.

329
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,780
Oh, Sheriff, we just missed him!

330
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,900
We gotta circulate this. On radio.

331
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,940
Alright.

332
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,020
What do we circulate?

333
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,580
Lookin for a man who has recently drunk milk?

334
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,420
Ah, Sheriff, that's aggravating.

335
00:36:38,455 --> 00:36:40,580
I'm ahead of you there.

336
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:47,300
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of
the sorts of sons of bitches that are hunting him?

337
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:49,460
I don't know. He ought to...

338
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,585
He seen the same things I've seen...

339
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,700
...and it certainly made an impression on me.

340
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,660
- Take me to a motel.
- Got one in mind?

341
00:37:05,695 --> 00:37:07,300
Someplace cheap.

342
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,380
You tell me the option.

343
00:37:11,415 --> 00:37:12,705
Do what now?

344
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,420
You pick the option goes
with the applicable rate.

345
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,260
I'm just one person. So, don't
matter the size of the bed.

346
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:30,340
This is Roberto Sagramore,
I'm not here right now.

347
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,740
Please leave a message.

348
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,340
Hello?

349
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,820
Is Llewelyn there?

350
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,820
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.

351
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,305
You expect him?

352
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,260
Now why would I expect him?

353
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,460
Who's this?

354
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,585
Can I help you?

355
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,820
Yeah. You got a pair of Larry
Mahan's, shoulder size 11.

356
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:58,225
I'll check.

357
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,180
- You sell socks?
- Just white.

358
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,020
White is all I wear.

359
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,820
You got a bathroom?

360
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,820
Don't stop. Just ride me up past those rooms.

361
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,180
- What room?
- Just drive me around.

362
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,420
I want to see if someone's here.

363
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,060
Keep going. Don't stop.

364
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,380
I don't wanna get into some
kind of a jackpot here, buddy.

365
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:52,740
It's alright.

366
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,540
Why don't I just set you down around
here and we won't argue about it.

367
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,140
Take me to another motel.

368
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,625
Let's just call it square.

369
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,660
Look, you're already in a jackpot.
I'm trying to get you out of it.

370
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,340
Now take me to another motel.

371
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,460
The lab reports from Austin
on that boy by the highway.

372
00:41:57,495 --> 00:41:58,797
What was the bullet?

373
00:41:58,832 --> 00:42:00,100
There wasn't no bullet.

374
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,700
Wasn't no bullet?

375
00:42:02,735 --> 00:42:04,180
Yes sir. Wasn't none.

376
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:09,420
Well, Wendell, with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

377
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,060
No sir.

378
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,860
You said entry wound in the forehead.

379
00:42:13,895 --> 00:42:15,220
No exit wound.

380
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:16,025
Yes sir.

381
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,905
Are you telling he shot
this boy in the head...

382
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,060
...and then went digging around
in there with a pocket knife?

383
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,100
Sir, I don't want to picture that.

384
00:42:23,135 --> 00:42:24,505
I don't either!

385
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,380
Can I freshen that there for you, Sheriff?

386
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,940
Yeah, Noreen, you better had.

387
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,420
The Rangers and the DEA are headed
back out to the scene this morning.

388
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,660
You gonna join 'em?

389
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,140
Any new bodies accumulated out there?

390
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,060
No sir.

391
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,060
Well then, I guess I can skip it.

392
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,985
Twelve gauge. You need shells?

393
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,020
- Yeah. Double ought.
- They'll give you a wallop.

394
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,980
Y'all got camping supplies?

395
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,065
Tent poles?

396
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,560
You already have a tent?

397
00:43:08,595 --> 00:43:09,985
Somethin' like that.

398
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,780
Well, you give me the model number on
the tent, I can order you the poles.

399
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,305
Never mind. I want a tent.

400
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,660
- Well, what kind of tent?
- The kind with the most poles.

401
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,500
Could I get another room?

402
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,825
You want to change rooms?

403
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,340
No m'am, I want to keep my
room and get another one.

404
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:46,740
Another additional?

405
00:43:46,775 --> 00:43:47,985
Yes, m'am.

406
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,220
And do you have a map of the rooms?

407
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:53,340
Yeah, we had a sorta one.

408
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,380
How bout 38?

409
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,340
Well, you can have the one
right next to yours if you want.

410
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,260
Number 137. It ain't took.

411
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,940
No, 38 will be fine.

412
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,420
That's got two double beds.

413
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,780
No me, mate.

414
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,700
How'd you find it?

415
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,340
No me, mate.

416
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:40,380
Shouldn't be doin' that.
Even a young man like you.

417
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:46,100
- Doin what?
- Hitchhiking.

418
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,500
Dangerous.

419
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:14,780
You know Anton Chigurh
by sight, is that correct?

420
00:53:14,815 --> 00:53:17,420
Yes sir.

421
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,100
When did you last see him?

422
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,940
November 28th, last year.

423
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,540
You seem pretty sure of the
date. Did I ask you to sit?

424
00:53:29,575 --> 00:53:30,225
No sir.

425
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,540
But you struck me as a man who
wouldn't want to waste a chair.

426
00:53:34,575 --> 00:53:38,820
I remember dates. Names. Numbers.
I saw him November the 28th.

427
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,385
We got a loose cannon here.

428
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,705
And we're out a bunch of money...

429
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,660
...and the other party is out his product.

430
00:53:46,695 --> 00:53:47,625
Yes sir.

431
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:52,620
This account will give up twelve hundred
dollars in any twenty-four hour period.

432
00:53:52,655 --> 00:53:54,700
That's up from a thousand.

433
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,460
If your expenses run higher
I hope you'll trust us for it.

434
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,820
Okay.

435
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,060
Just how well do you know Chigurh?

436
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,465
What do you want to know?

437
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,980
I just want to know your opinion of him.

438
00:54:07,015 --> 00:54:07,900
In general.

439
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,820
Just how dangerous is he?

440
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:13,780
Compared to what? The bubonic plague?

441
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,020
He's bad enough that you called me.

442
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,740
Yeah, he's a psychopathic killer but so what?

443
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,220
There's plenty of them around.

444
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,065
He killed three men in
Del Rio Motel yesterday.

445
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,860
And two others in that colossal
goatfuck out in the desert.

446
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,585
We can stop that.

447
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,340
You seem pretty sure of yourself.

448
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:38,060
You've led something of a charmed
life haven't you, Mr. Wells?

449
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,985
In all honesty...

450
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,700
...I can't say that charm has
had a whole lot to do with it.

451
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,020
I'm wondering...

452
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,460
Yes?

453
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,700
Can I get my parking ticket validated?

454
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,580
An attempt at humor, I suppose.

455
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,140
I'm sorry.

456
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:08,540
You know I counted the floors
of this building from the street?

457
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,020
There's one missing.

458
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,420
We'll look into it.

459
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,780
One room, one night.

460
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,340
- That'll be twenty-six
dollars. - Alright.

461
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,185
You on all night?

462
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:50,220
Yes sir, I'll be around here
until ten o'clock in the morning.

463
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,780
This here's for you. Now, I ain't
asking you to do anything illegal.

464
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,860
There's someone who's been
lookin for me. Not police.

465
00:55:58,895 --> 00:56:02,380
Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.

466
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,220
By anyone, I mean any swinging dude.

467
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,020
There just ain't no way.

468
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:28,620
Don't worry. I ain't gonna hurt you.

469
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:31,420
I need you to drive me on out of here.

470
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,580
Were you in a car accident?

471
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:20,900
Yeah.

472
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,980
- Gimme the money.
- It's right here. Give me the clothes.

473
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,500
Let him hold the money.

474
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,820
Gimme that beer too.

475
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,460
How much?

476
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:51,380
Brian. Give him the beer.

477
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:07,380
Medico. Por favor.

478
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,260
Any word on those vehicles yet?

479
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:16,300
Sheriff, I found out
everything there was to find.

480
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:20,100
Those vehicles are titled and
registered to deceased people.

481
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,900
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead twenty years.

482
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:26,260
Did you want me to see what I could
find out about the Mexican ones?

483
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,260
No. Lord no.

484
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,900
Here's this month's checks.

485
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,760
That DEA agent called again.

486
01:13:33,795 --> 01:13:35,265
You don't want to talk to him?

487
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,460
I'm goin' to try and keep
from it as much as I can.

488
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,820
He's goin' back out there and he wanted
to know if you wanted to go with him.

489
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:42,580
That's cordial of him.

490
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,625
Could I get you to call Loretta for me...

491
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,940
...and tell her I'm goin' to
Odessa to see Carla Jean Moss?

492
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:49,420
Yes, Sheriff.

493
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:51,620
I'll call her when I get there.

494
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:54,420
I'd call her now but she'll want
me to come home and I just might.

495
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,380
You want me to wait til
you've quit the building?

496
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:01,300
You don't want to lie without
what it's absolutely necessary.

497
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,420
What is it that Torbert
says about truth and justice?

498
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:11,980
Oh, we dedicate ourselves
daily anew. Something like that.

499
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:14,860
I think I'm goin' to commence
dedicatin' myself twice daily.

500
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:17,660
It might come to three
times before it's over...

501
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,620
Oh, what the hell?

502
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,460
Sheriff?

503
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:32,900
Have you looked at your load lately?

504
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,260
That is a damned outrage.

505
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,500
Oh. One of those tiedowns worked lose.

506
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:41,140
How many bodies did you leave with?

507
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,420
I ain't lost none of 'em, Sheriff.

508
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:46,980
Couldn't you all of took a van out there?

509
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,540
Didn't have no van with four-wheel drive.

510
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:52,260
You going to write me up
for improperly secured load?

511
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,940
You get your ass out of here.

512
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:04,060
I'm guessin' this isn't the future
you had pictured for yourself...

513
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,980
...when you first clapped eyes on that money.

514
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:10,980
Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.

515
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:12,980
I know.

516
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:17,620
- I've seen him.
- You've seen him?

517
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,700
And you're not dead.

518
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:24,700
Is this guy supposed to
be the ultimate bad-ass?

519
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:28,260
- I don't think that's how I'd describe him.
- How would you describe him?

520
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:32,780
I guess I'd say... he
doesn't have a sense of humor.

521
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:34,900
His name is Chigurh.

522
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:37,580
- Sugar?
- Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

523
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:41,380
- You know how he found you?
- I know how he found me.

524
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:44,180
- It's called a transponder.
- I know what it is.

525
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,420
He won't find me again.

526
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:48,740
- Not that way.
- Not any way.

527
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:52,300
- Took me about three hours.
- Yeah, well, I've been immobile.

528
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,740
No. You don't understand.

529
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:01,020
- What do you do?
- I'm retired.

530
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,700
What did you do?

531
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:04,980
- Welder.
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig?

532
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:07,460
Any of it. If it can be welded, I can weld it.

533
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,385
- Cast iron?
- Yes.

534
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:11,740
- I don't mean braze.
- I didn't say braze.

535
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,940
- Pot metal?
- What did I say?

536
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:17,220
Were you in Nam?

537
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,300
Yeah. I was in Nam.

538
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:23,900
So was I.

539
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,540
So what does that make me, your buddy?

540
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:32,940
Look, you gotta give me this money.
I got no other reason to protect you.

541
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:36,500
It's too late. I spent it.

542
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:42,220
About a million and a half on whores and whiskey
...and the rest of it, I just sort of blew it here.

543
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:47,860
How do you know he's not on his way to Odessa?

544
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:55,860
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- To kill your wife.

545
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:05,140
Maybe he's the one who needs to be worried.

546
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:08,620
- About me.
- He isn't.

547
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:12,740
You're not cut out for this.

548
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:17,300
You're just a guy who happened
to find those vehicles.

549
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:27,020
I'm across the river. At the
Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.

550
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:30,340
Call me when you've had enough.

551
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:33,060
I can even let you keep a little of the money.

552
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:34,505
If I was into cutting deals...

553
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,820
...why wouldn't I just
deal with this guy Chigurh?

554
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:41,140
You don't understand. You
can't make a deal with him.

555
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:43,980
Even if you gave him the money
back, he'd still kill you...

556
01:17:44,015 --> 01:17:46,500
...just for inconvenience in him.

557
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:50,460
He's a peculiar man. Might
even say he has principles.

558
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:55,540
Principles that transcend money
or drugs or anything like that.

559
01:17:56,020 --> 01:18:00,580
He's not like you. He's not even like me.

560
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:05,060
He don't talk as much as you,
I give him points for that.

561
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,060
Carla Jean. Thank you for comin'.

562
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,500
Don't know why I did.

563
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:14,060
I told you, I don't know where he is.

564
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,340
- You ain't heard from him?
- No I ain't.

565
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:18,260
- Nothin'?
- Not word one.

566
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:22,380
- Would you tell me if you had?
- Well, I don't know.

567
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:26,660
- He don't need any trouble from you.
- It ain't me he's in trouble with.

568
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:30,660
- Who's he in trouble with then?
- Some pretty bad people.

569
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:34,940
These people will kill him,
Carla Jean. They won't quit.

570
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:38,140
He won't neither. He never has.

571
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,980
He can take all comers.

572
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:47,100
You know Charlie Walser? He's got
that place out east of Sanderson?

573
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:53,420
Well you know how they used to slaughter
beefs, hit 'em right there with a maul...

574
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:55,220
.. truss 'em up and slit their throats?

575
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,420
Here Charlie's got one all trussed
up and all set to drain him....

576
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,820
...and the beef comes to.
It starts thrashing around.

577
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:06,020
Six hundred pounds of very pissed-off
livestock if you'll excuse me.

578
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,700
Charlie grabs his gun there to
shoot the damn thing in the head...

579
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:15,500
...but with all the swayin' and then the trashin' it's a glance-shot
and ricochets around and comes back hits Charlie in the shoulder.

580
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:16,705
You go see Charlie...

581
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:19,220
he still can't pick up his
right hand for his hat...

582
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:22,900
The point bein', even in the
contest between man and steer...

583
01:19:22,935 --> 01:19:25,420
...the issue is not certain.

584
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:37,860
When Llewelyn calls, just
tell him I'll make him safe.

585
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:45,300
Course they slaughter steers
a lot different these days.

586
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:48,100
Use a air gun.

587
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:53,340
Shoots out a little rock, about that far into the brain.
Sucks right back in. Animal never knows what hit him.

588
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,860
- Why you telling me that, Sheriff?
- I don't know.

589
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,020
My mind wanders.

590
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:30,340
Hello, Carson.

591
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,660
Let's go to your room.

592
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:49,585
We don't have to do this.

593
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:54,020
I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.

594
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,300
Why would I let you do that?

595
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,580
I'll make it worth your while.

596
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:03,220
Take you to an ATM. Forteen grand in it.

597
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,260
And everybody just walks away.

598
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:08,940
An ATM...

599
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:17,980
- I know where the satchel is.
- If you knew, you would have it with you.

600
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:22,740
Find it from the river
bank. I know where it is.

601
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,900
I know something better.

602
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:28,580
- What's that?
- I know where it's going to be.

603
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:36,580
- Where is that?
- It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.

604
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:43,420
You don't know to a certainty.
Twenty minutes it could be here.

605
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:47,780
I do know to a certainty. And you know
what's going to happen now, Carson?

606
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:53,420
You should admit your situation.
There would be more dignity in it.

607
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:00,060
You go to hell.

608
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:03,620
Alright.

609
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:05,420
Let me ask you something.

610
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:12,380
If the rule you followed
brought you to this...

611
01:23:12,415 --> 01:23:14,820
...of what use was the rule?

612
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:24,740
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

613
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:28,140
You mean the nature of this conversation?

614
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,300
I mean the nature of you.

615
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:40,940
You can have the money, Anton.

616
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:21,560
Hello?

617
01:24:21,595 --> 01:24:22,860
Yes?

618
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:27,620
Is Carson Wells there?

619
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,140
Not in the sense that you mean.

620
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:36,500
You need to come see me.

621
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,380
Who is this?

622
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:40,340
You know who it is.

623
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:43,540
You need to talk to me.

624
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:45,060
I don't need to talk to you.

625
01:24:45,095 --> 01:24:46,300
I think you do.

626
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:49,460
Do you know where I'm going?

627
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:51,980
Why would I care where you're going.

628
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,020
I know where you are.

629
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:56,580
Yeah? Where am I?

630
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,660
You're in a hospital across the river.

631
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:03,660
But that's not where I'm going.
Do you know where I'm going?

632
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,620
Yeah. I know where you're going.

633
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:09,220
Alright.

634
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:11,705
You know she won't be there.

635
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:13,940
It doesn't make any difference where she is.

636
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,860
So what're you goin up there for?

637
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:22,540
You know how this is going
to turn out, don't you?

638
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:25,580
No.

639
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:30,460
I think you do too. So
this is what I'll offer.

640
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,780
You bring me the money and I'll let her go.

641
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:38,540
Otherwise she's accountable. Same as you.

642
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:43,060
That's the best deal you're going to get.

643
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:47,300
I won't tell you you can save
yourself because you can't.

644
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:52,620
Yeah, I'm goin to bring you somethin' alright.

645
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:56,380
I've decided to make you
a special project of mine.

646
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:58,380
You ain't goin' to have
to come look for me at all.

647
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:05,260
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yessir.

648
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:07,780
None of the three had ID on 'em...

649
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:09,660
...but they're tellin me
that all three is Mexicans.

650
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:11,140
Was Mexicans.

651
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:16,100
There's a question. Whether
they stopped it? And when?

652
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:19,620
Yessir.

653
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:22,700
Now, Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

654
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:25,580
- Yessir. It was punched out.
- Okay.

655
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:28,060
You wanna drive out there?

656
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,100
No, that's all I've to look for and it sounds
like these old boys died of natural causes.

657
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:33,545
How's that, Sheriff?

658
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,820
Natural to the line of work they was in.

659
01:26:35,855 --> 01:26:36,820
Yessir.

660
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:40,660
My god, Wendell, it's just all-out war.
I can't think of any other word for it.

661
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,900
Who are these people?

662
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:45,665
Here last week they found this couple out...

663
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,300
...in California, they'd
rent out rooms to old people.

664
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:52,980
Kill em, bury em in the yard and
cash their social security checks.

665
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:57,420
They'd torture them first. I don't know why.

666
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:00,740
Maybe their television set was broke.

667
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:03,620
And this went on until, and here I quote:

668
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:09,740
Neighbors were alerted when a man ran from
the premises wearing only a dog collar.

669
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:15,060
You can't make up such a thing
as that. I dare you to even try.

670
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:18,340
But that's what it took, you'll
notice. Get somebody's attention.

671
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:21,620
Diggin graves in the back
yard didn't bring any.

672
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:31,140
That's all right. I laugh myself sometimes.

673
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:36,060
There ain't a whole lot else you can do.

674
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:39,860
Tell me something.

675
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:43,140
Who do you think gets through this
gate into the United States of America?

676
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:47,620
I don't know. American citizens?

677
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:50,260
Some American citizens.
Who do you think decides?

678
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:53,740
- Well, you do, I reckon.
- That is correct. How do I decide?

679
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:56,500
- I don't know.
- I ask questions.

680
01:27:56,540 --> 01:28:00,660
And if I get sensible answers then they get to go to
America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't.

681
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:02,700
- Anything about that you don't understand?
- No sir.

682
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:05,540
Then I ask you again. How you come
to be out here with no clothes?

683
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:08,860
I got an overcoat on.

684
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:11,540
- Are you jackin' with me?
- Oh, no sir.

685
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:13,340
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes sir.

686
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:16,540
- Are you in the service?
- No sir. I'm a veteran.

687
01:28:16,575 --> 01:28:18,940
- Nam?
- Yes sir. Two tours.

688
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:20,140
What outfit?

689
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:25,780
Twelfth Infantry Battalion.
August 7th 1966 to July 2nd 1968.

690
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:29,620
- Wilson!
- Yessir.

691
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:34,340
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

692
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:46,940
- How those Larries holdin' up?
- Oh, good.

693
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:49,740
- I need everything else.
- Okay.

694
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:53,460
You have a lot of people come
in here without any clothes on?

695
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,860
No sir, it's unusual.

696
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,780
She don't want to talk to you.

697
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:12,140
Yes she does. Put her on.

698
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,580
Do you know what time it is?

699
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:16,260
I don't care what time it is.
And don't you hang up this phone.

700
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:23,300
- Llewelyn.
- Hey you.

701
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:26,540
- What should I do?
- You know what's goin' on?

702
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:30,300
I don't know, I had the sheriff
here from Terrell County.

703
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:31,700
What did you tell him?

704
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:36,180
What did I know to tell
him? You're hurt, ain't you?

705
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:39,700
What makes you say that?

706
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,585
I can hear it in your voice.

707
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:43,780
There is falseness in his voice!

708
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:46,780
Look, I want you to meet me at
the Desert Sands motel in El Paso.

709
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:50,020
Cause I'm gonna give you the
money and I'ma put you on a plane.

710
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:52,625
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna
leave you in the lurch.

711
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:56,580
No. This works better. With you gone and
I don't have the money, he can't touch me.

712
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:58,545
But I can sure touch him.

713
01:29:58,580 --> 01:30:01,020
And after I find him I'll come and join you.

714
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:04,660
Find who? What am I
supposed to do with Mother?

715
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:06,860
- Nah, she'll be alright.
- She'll be alright?

716
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,420
Be all right?! I've got the cancer!

717
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:11,940
Ain't nobody's gonna bother her.

718
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:47,220
Who are you?

719
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,660
- Me?
- Yes.

720
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:57,220
Nobody. Accounting.

721
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:01,940
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

722
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:09,500
He feels... he felt that...
the more people looking...

723
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:13,860
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.

724
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:20,700
I see. Are you going to shoot me?

725
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:33,020
That depends. Do you see me?

726
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:38,500
I always seen this is what it would come to.

727
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:41,100
Three years ago I pre-visioned it.

728
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:43,060
It ain't even three years we been married.

729
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:47,460
Three years ago I said them
very words. No and Good.

730
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:51,905
Here we are. Ninety degree heat.

731
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:56,220
I got the cancer. And look at
this. Not even a home to go to.

732
01:31:57,020 --> 01:32:02,980
We're goin' to El Paso Texas. You know
how many people I know in El Paso Texas?

733
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:06,340
- No ma'am.
- That's how many.

734
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:18,220
- I didn't see my Prednizone.
- I put it in, Mama.

735
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:21,740
- Well I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in. That one.

736
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:25,820
You just set there. I'll get
tickets and a cart for the bags.

737
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:28,420
Do you need help with the bags, madam?

738
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:32,100
Well, thank god there is one
gentleman left in West Texas.

739
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:35,060
Yes, thank you. I am old and I am not well.

740
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:39,620
- Which bus are you taking?
- We're going to El Paso. Don't ask me why.

741
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:42,580
It's not often you see a Mexican in a suit.

742
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:46,060
You go to El Paso? I know
it. Where are you staying?

743
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:48,500
Carla Jean, how are you?

744
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:52,580
Sheriff, was that a true
story about Charlie Walser?

745
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:54,380
Who's Charlie Walser?

746
01:32:57,860 --> 01:33:01,980
True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail
but it's certainly true that it is a story.

747
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:03,380
Yeah, right.

748
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:07,420
Sheriff, can you give me
your word on somethin'?

749
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,580
Yes ma'am?

750
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:12,665
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed...

751
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:15,380
...you promise it'll be just
you goes and talks with him?

752
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:17,420
You and nobody else.

753
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:19,460
Yes ma'am, I do.

754
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:21,900
Llewelyn would never ask for help.

755
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:24,420
He never thinks he needs any.

756
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:27,340
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.

757
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:32,020
And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.

758
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:42,740
What's the problem there, neighbor?

759
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:47,300
That'll suck some power. Over time.

760
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:52,980
- You from around here?
- Alpine. Born and bred.

761
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:54,100
Here ya go.

762
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:59,860
- What airport would you use?
- Well? Airport or airstrip?

763
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:03,260
- Airport.
- Well, where ya goin'?

764
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:07,620
- I don't know.
- Just lightin' out for the territories, huh?

765
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:10,220
Brother, I been there.

766
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:11,180
Well...

767
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:15,220
There's airstrips. The airport is El Paso.

768
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:19,540
You want some place specific you might
could be better off just drivin' to Dallas.

769
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:21,220
Not have to connect.

770
01:34:22,580 --> 01:34:27,180
- You gonna clamp them, buddy?
- Can you get those chicken crates out of the bed?

771
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:30,300
What're you talkin' about?

772
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:51,140
- Hey. Mr. Sporting Goods.
- Hey yourself.

773
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:52,980
You a sport?

774
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:56,180
Yeah, that's me.

775
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:58,580
I got beers in my room.

776
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:02,620
Waiting on my wife.

777
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:07,820
- That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
- Half.

778
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:12,180
- What else then?
- Just lookin' for what's comin'.

779
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:15,780
Yeah, but no one ever sees that.

780
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:19,500
Beer. That's what's comin'.

781
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:22,700
I'll bring the ice chest out
here. You can stay married.

782
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:25,220
No ma'am. I know what beer leads to.

783
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:29,500
Beer leads to more beer.

784
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:24,900
Call police.

785
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,380
Your local law enforcement.

786
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:36,020
I'm not on their radio.

787
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:29,420
Buy you a cup of coffee before you drive home?

788
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:31,380
No money in his room there?

789
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:36,020
Couple hundred on his person. Those
hombres would've taken the stash.

790
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:40,620
I suppose so. Though they
was leavin' in a hurry.

791
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,780
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom.

792
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:45,820
The money and the drugs.

793
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:50,060
It's just goddamned beyond everything.

794
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:53,380
What's it mean? What's it leading to?

795
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:58,540
You know, if you'd a told me twenty
years ago, I'd see children walking...

796
01:37:58,575 --> 01:38:03,140
the streets of our Texas towns with
green hair and bones in their noses.

797
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:05,860
I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.

798
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:10,020
Signs and wonders. But I think once
you quit hearin' sir and ma'am...

799
01:38:10,055 --> 01:38:11,900
...the rest is soon to follow.

800
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:16,700
Oh, it's the tide. It's the dismal tide.

801
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:19,340
- It is not the one thing.
- Not the one thing.

802
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:21,460
None of that explains your man though.

803
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:25,620
He's just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

804
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:29,020
- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Yeah well, what would you call him?

805
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:33,020
I don't know. Sometimes I
think he's pretty much a ghost.

806
01:38:33,055 --> 01:38:34,900
- He's real all right.
- Oh yeah?

807
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:38,980
All that at the? Motel.
It's beyond everything.

808
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:41,620
Yeah, he has some hard bark on him.

809
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,260
That don't hardly say it.

810
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:47,065
He shoots the desk clerk one day.

811
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:50,900
Walks right back in the next and
shoots a retired army colonel.

812
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:53,140
It's hard to believe.

813
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:56,220
Strolls right back into a crime scene.

814
01:38:56,580 --> 01:39:01,260
Who would do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?

815
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:04,945
Good trip, Ed Tom.

816
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:07,580
I'm sorry we couldn't help your boy.

817
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:41,380
Min back!

818
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:45,380
- How'd you know I was here?
- Who else'd be driving up your truck?

819
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:47,780
- You heard it?
- How's that?

820
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:54,100
- You heard what I'm - you havin fun
with me? - What give you that idea?

821
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:57,900
- I seen one of the cats heard it. -
But - how'd you know it was my truck?

822
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:01,620
I deduced it. When you walked in.

823
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:03,460
How many of those things you got now?

824
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,820
Cats? I don't know. Several.

825
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:08,780
Well, it depends on what you mean by got.

826
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:13,420
Some of 'em are half-wild, and
some of 'em are just outlaws.

827
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:19,705
How you been, Ellis?

828
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:25,340
You lookin' at it. I got
to say you lookin' older.

829
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:27,020
I am older.

830
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:30,465
Got a letter from your wife.

831
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:35,180
She writes to me pretty regular,
keep me up on the family news.

832
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:38,700
- Didn't know there was any.
- She told me you were quittin'.

833
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:44,580
- You want a cup?
- 'Preciate it.

834
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:53,980
How fresh is that coffee?

835
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:59,660
I generally make a fresh pot ever
week even if there's some left over.

836
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:05,140
That man who shot you died in prison.

837
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:08,100
In Angola. Yeah.

838
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:11,060
What would you a done if he'd been released?

839
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:16,500
I don't know. Nothin.
Wouldn't be no point to it.

840
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:19,740
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.

841
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:23,305
Well, all the time you
spend tryin' to get back...

842
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:26,900
...what's been took from you
more is goin' out the door.

843
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:31,060
After a while, you just have to
try to get a tourniquet on it.

844
01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:35,260
Your granddaddy never asked
me to sign on as a deputy.

845
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:40,740
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.

846
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:42,740
How come're you doin' that?

847
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:44,540
I don't know.

848
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:49,660
I feel overmatched.

849
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:55,900
I always figured when I got older...

850
01:44:56,500 --> 01:45:01,020
...God would sort of come
into my life in some way.

851
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:05,580
He didn't.

852
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:10,980
I don't blame him.

853
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:16,460
If I was him I'd have the same
opinion about me that he does.

854
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:18,820
You don't know what he thinks.

855
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:36,900
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster
and badge over to the Rangers.

856
01:45:36,935 --> 01:45:37,900
Put up in a museum.

857
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:43,060
Your daddy ever tell you how
Uncle Mac come to his reward?

858
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:47,540
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

859
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:54,340
Seven or eight of 'em come up to
here. Wantin' this and wantin' that.

860
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:57,820
Uncle Mac went back in the
house and got the shotgun...

861
01:45:57,855 --> 01:46:00,740
They was way ahead of him.

862
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:04,060
Shot him in the doorway.

863
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:07,340
Aunt Ella came out and
tried to stop the bleedin'.

864
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:10,180
Uncle Mac all the while
tryin' to get that shotgun.

865
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:14,740
They just sat there on their
horses watchin' him die.

866
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:21,260
After a while, one of 'em says somethin
in Injun and they all turned and left out.

867
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:29,340
Well, Uncle Mac knew the
score even if Aunt Ella didn't.

868
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:31,740
Shot through the left lung.

869
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:36,940
And that was that. As they say.

870
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:45,780
- When did he die?
- 1909.

871
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:51,820
No, I mean was it right away
or in the night or when was it?

872
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:55,700
I believe it's that night. She
buried him the next mornin'.

873
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:58,620
Diggin' in that hard old caliche.

874
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:05,140
What you got ain't nothin new.

875
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:08,700
This country is hard on people.

876
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:14,580
You can't stop what's comin'.

877
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:18,740
Ain't all waitin' on you.

878
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:23,540
That's vanity.

879
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:28,260
- I knew this wasn't done with.
- No.

880
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:33,185
I ain't got the money.

881
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:37,500
What little I had is long gone and
there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

882
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:43,380
I buried my mother today. I
ain't paid for that neither.

883
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:46,740
I wouldn't worry about it.

884
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:51,380
I need to sit down.

885
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:08,500
You got no cause to hurt me.

886
01:49:08,860 --> 01:49:12,300
No. But I gave my word.

887
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:17,300
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

888
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:25,900
That don't make sense. You gave
your word to my husband to kill me?

889
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:29,460
Your husband had the opportunity to save you.

890
01:49:29,495 --> 01:49:32,740
Instead, he used you to try to save himself.

891
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:43,620
Not like that. Not like you say.

892
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:50,940
You don't have to do this.

893
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:52,980
They'll always say the same thing.

894
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:56,740
What did they say?

895
01:49:57,140 --> 01:50:00,300
They say you don't have to do this.

896
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:02,260
You don't.

897
01:50:10,740 --> 01:50:12,900
This is the best I can do.

898
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:15,620
Call it.

899
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:23,540
I knowed you was crazy when
I saw you sittin' there.

900
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:28,540
I knowed exactly what was in store for me.

901
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:31,580
- Call it.
- No.

902
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:35,020
I ain't gonna call it.

903
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:42,620
- Call it.
- The coin don't have no say.

904
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:45,420
It's just you.

905
01:50:47,820 --> 01:50:51,300
Well, I got here the same way the coin did.

906
01:52:33,620 --> 01:52:36,780
Mister, there's a bone
stickin' out of your arm.

907
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:38,980
I'm alright. Let me just sit here a minute.

908
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:42,220
There's an ambulance comin'.
Man over yonder went to call.

909
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:43,860
Alright.

910
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:48,340
Are you all right? You got a
bone stickin' out of your arm.

911
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:51,660
What will you take for that shirt?

912
01:52:56,620 --> 01:52:59,460
Hell mister, I'll give you my shirt.

913
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:09,300
Look at that fuckin' bone.

914
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,420
Tie this for me.

915
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:13,540
Just tie it.

916
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:36,500
Hell mister. Look, I don't mind helping
someone out. That's a lot of money.

917
01:53:36,540 --> 01:53:41,620
Take it. Take it and you didn't see me.

918
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:43,340
I was already gone.

919
01:53:43,620 --> 01:53:45,220
Yessir.

920
01:53:49,540 --> 01:53:52,900
- Part of that's mine.
- You still got your damn shirt.

921
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:56,420
- That ain't what it was for.
- Well maybe, but I'm still out a shirt.

922
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:20,340
- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- Okay.

923
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:23,620
- What do you think?
- I can't plan your day.

924
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:27,060
I mean, would you care to join me?

925
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:29,260
Lord no. I'm not retired.

926
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:33,420
Maybe I'll help out here then.

927
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:36,020
Better not.

928
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:43,300
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

929
01:54:43,540 --> 01:54:46,900
Well you got time for 'em
now. Anything interesting?

930
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:50,340
They always is to the party concerned.

931
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:55,700
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

932
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:01,580
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had
my father. It's peculiar.

933
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:06,980
I'm older now than he
ever was by twenty years.

934
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:10,220
So, in a sense he's the younger man.

935
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:13,025
Anyway, first one I don't
remember too well but...

936
01:55:13,060 --> 01:55:17,540
It was about meeting him in town
someplace where he gave me some money.

937
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:20,340
I think I lost it.

938
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:26,580
The second one, it was like we
was both back in older times...

939
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:31,060
...and I was on horseback goin'
through the mountains of a night.

940
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:34,620
Goin' through this pass in the mountains.

941
01:55:34,860 --> 01:55:43,500
It was cold and there's snow on the ground. He rode past me and
kept on goin'. Never said nothin goin' by. He just rode on past.

942
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:49,220
He had his blanket wrapped
around him and his head down.

943
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:52,740
When he rode past I seen he was...

944
01:55:52,775 --> 01:55:54,740
...carryin fire in a horn...

945
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:59,100
...the way people used to do and I could
see the horn from the light inside of it.

946
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:01,140
About the color of the moon.

947
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:07,865
And in the dream I knew
that he was goin' on ahead...

948
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:13,140
and that he's fixin to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and all that cold.

949
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:21,340
I knew that whenever I
got there he'd be there.

950
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:25,420
Then, I woke up.

951
