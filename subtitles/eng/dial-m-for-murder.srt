2
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,954
Let me get you another drink.

3
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:29,960
Mark, before Tony comes,
I ought to explain something.

4
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,964
Yes, I've been waiting for that.

5
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:34,763
I haven't told him anything about us.

6
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:37,132
That's not surprising.
It's a tough thing to do.

7
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:41,175
When you telephoned this morning,
I simply said you wrote crime stories.

8
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:43,972
And I'd met you once
when you were here before.

9
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:47,776
That has a pretty guilty ring to it.
I'd never use it in one of my stories.

10
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:49,815
Mark, I know you think it's silly.

11
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:52,921
When you get to know Tony,
you'll understand why I said that.

12
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,024
Darling, I understand now.
That doesn't stop me from loving you.

13
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,593
It's not as simple as that.

14
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,465
- Tony's changed.
- Thanks.

15
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:11,070
He's a completely different person
to the one I used to tell you about.

16
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:12,970
Really? When did all this happen?

17
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:15,269
That night I came to say goodbye.

18
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,505
When I left your apartment,
I came back here.

19
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:21,047
I sat down on the sofa
and had a good cry.

20
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:22,775
And then I fell asleep.

21
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,214
When I woke up...

22
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:27,754
...there was Tony standing in the hall
with his bags and tennis rackets.

23
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:30,984
He just said he decided to give up tennis
and settle down to a job.

24
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:33,289
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

25
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,990
Of course, I didn't believe him at first,
but he meant it, all right.

26
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,768
But he's been wonderful ever since.

27
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:42,564
I suppose that's when
you stopped writing me.

28
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,570
Margot, is it?

29
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,766
Do you remember the letters
you wrote to me?

30
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,468
Yes, I remember.

31
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,173
After I read them, I burned them.
I thought it best.

32
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,510
All except one.

33
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:57,676
You probably know
the one I mean.

34
00:03:57,854 --> 00:03:59,651
Yes, I think I do.

35
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,017
What about it?

36
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:03,453
It was stolen.

37
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:10,690
Tony and I were going to spend
the weekend in the country with friends.

38
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:14,132
While waiting on the platform,
I noticed my handbag was missing.

39
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:15,601
And the letter was inside.

40
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:18,240
- Where was this?
- Victoria Station.

41
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:21,809
I thought I'd left it in the restaurant,
but when I went back, it had gone.

42
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,536
You mean you never found it?

43
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:26,011
I recovered the handbag
about two weeks later...

44
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,982
...from the lost and found,
but the letter wasn't there.

45
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:33,611
Then about a week afterwards,
I received a note.

46
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,350
It told me what I had to do
to get the letter back.

47
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,255
Yes. Go ahead.
Go on.

48
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,061
I was to draw £50
from my bank in £5 notes...

49
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:46,531
...and then change them
for used £1 notes.

50
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,831
It said that if I went to the police
or told anyone else...

51
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:52,338
...he would show the letter
to my husband.

52
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:54,237
You still have the note?

53
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:23,536
Printed, all capitals.

54
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,833
- Anyone could've done this.
- Two days later...

55
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,842
...I got this one.
- Both mailed in Brixton.

56
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,718
"Throw half the money in a package
and mail to John S. King.

57
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:38,513
23 Newport Street,
Brixton SW9.

58
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,315
You'll get your letter by return."

59
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,152
It's a little shop.
People use it as a forwarding address.

60
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:44,884
You didn't mail the money.

61
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:47,586
Yes, but the letter was never returned.

62
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,891
So after waiting about
two weeks, I went there.

63
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,227
Said they had never heard
of a man by that name.

64
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:54,962
The parcel was still there.
It had never been opened.

65
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:57,606
That's something, I suppose.
May I keep these?

66
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,607
- Yes, if you like.
- I can't understand why you didn't tell me.

67
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,768
There wasn't anything
you could do.

68
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,846
You probably would have
made me tell Tony and the police.

69
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:08,609
It was only £50, I thought
I'd pay and have done with it.

70
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,582
I'm gonna tell Tony
about us tonight.

71
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:12,687
No, Mark, please,
you mustn't.

72
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:15,415
You don't understand.
Tony's changed.

73
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:17,218
Please.

74
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:22,287
I wish it was a year ago,
when you came to say goodbye.

75
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:25,558
We were in the kitchen. I said,
"I can't go through with this.

76
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:27,794
Let's find Tony and
tell him all about it."

77
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,495
I believe you'd
have done it then.

78
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:34,535
Well, I can see this is
gonna be a rough evening.

79
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,577
All of us saying
nice things to each other.

80
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,546
Look, there's only one thing
you haven't explained.

81
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:45,278
Why didn't you burn
that letter too?

82
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,230
There you are. We thought
you were never coming.

83
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:06,068
- What have you been up to?
- I'm sorry. The boss blew in...

84
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:09,234
...just as I was leaving.
- Tony, this is Mark Halliday.

85
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:10,674
- Mark.
- Tony.

86
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,213
I'm terribly sorry
to be so late.

87
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,310
- How do you like it over here, Mark?
- Well, fine. Just fine, Tony.

88
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:19,421
Is this your first visit to London?

89
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:22,649
No, no. I was here
a year ago for vacation.

90
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:25,350
Oh, yes, that's right.
Margot told me.

91
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,656
- You write for the radio, don't you?
- No, television, for my sins.

92
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:30,958
- Darling, did you reserve a table?
- Yes, 7:00.

93
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:34,194
- Come on, then...
- Darling, a slight alteration in plans.

94
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,531
- Now, don't say you can't go.
- I'm afraid so.

95
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,970
Old man Burgess is flying
to Brussels on Sunday.

96
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:41,542
And I have to get my monthly
report in by tomorrow.

97
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,178
Can't you do it when
we get back?

98
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:44,836
I'm afraid not.
It'll take hours.

99
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:47,380
I shall have to fake
half of it as it is.

100
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:51,085
Could you join us after the theater?
We might go somewhere.

101
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:52,812
Give me a ring in intermission.

102
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:55,719
- lf I'm inspired, I might make it.
- Well, do try.

103
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,792
I'll just get my things, Mark.

104
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,793
- Here are the tickets.
- Thanks, Tony.

105
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:02,726
I'm afraid this is
terribly rude of me.

106
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,890
Not at all. I'm just sorry
you can't come.

107
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,932
- You must come to dinner.
- I'd like that.

108
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:08,968
What are you doing tomorrow night?

109
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:10,696
Saturday?
Nothing I know of.

110
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:12,500
Would you like to
join a stag party?

111
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:13,937
- A stag party?
- Yes.

112
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,305
Some Americans have been playing
tennis all over the continent.

113
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,276
We're giving them
a farewell dinner.

114
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:20,506
- I'm not much of a tennis player.
- Doesn't matter.

115
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,150
You know New York and all that.

116
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:24,650
- Mark's coming to the party tomorrow night.
- Good.

117
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,981
You better drop in here first
and have a drink.

118
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:28,885
- That's the idea.
- Yes. All right.

119
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:32,550
- I'll try and get a taxi.
- No, we can usually pick one up.

120
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:34,719
So long, darling.

121
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:36,159
Enjoy yourself.

122
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,664
- So long, Tony.
- Good night.

123
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,660
- Oh, Mark.
- Yes?

124
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:44,397
Sell the extra ticket
and have a drink on the proceeds.

125
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:46,565
- All right. We'll try.
- Have a good time.

126
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:48,266
Thanks. Good night.

127
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,037
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hello. Hampstead 78-double-9?

128
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:26,044
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Could I speak to Captain Lesgate?

129
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:27,546
- <i>Speaking.</i>
- Good evening.

130
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:29,708
You don't know me.
My name is Fisher.

131
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:31,580
I understand you have
a car for sale.

132
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:34,348
- <i>Yes, an American car.</i>
- Yes, I saw it at your garage.

133
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:36,457
- How much are you asking?
- <i>Eleven hundred.</i>

134
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:39,561
Eleven hundred? I see. It certainly looks
just the job for me.

135
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:41,094
I don't like that price much.

136
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:43,425
<i>I didn't like it when I bought it.</i>

137
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:46,966
- Now, when can we meet?
- <i>Well, now, how about tomorrow afternoon</i>?

138
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:49,127
I'm afraid I can't manage that.

139
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:52,172
No, I can't, and I'm going
to Liverpool on Sunday.

140
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,638
I was rather hoping...

141
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:56,607
- You couldn't come to my flat tonight?
- <i>Where is it</i>?

142
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:00,146
Maida Vale. I'd call on you,
only I've twisted my knee rather badly.

143
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:02,307
<i>I'm sorry. Well, what's your address</i>?

144
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:04,419
- 61 A Charrington Gardens.
- <i>Harrington</i>?

145
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:07,147
No. Charrington.
Turn left at the underground.

146
00:10:07,323 --> 00:10:09,917
- It's a two minutes' walk.
- <i>I'll be there in an hour.</i>

147
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:13,653
That's extremely good of you.
By the way, will you bring the car?

148
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:17,128
- <i>I'm afraid I can't.</i>
- Doesn't matter. I had a good look at it.

149
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,360
You might bring the registration book
and any necessary papers.

150
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,367
- <i>Yes, of course.</i>
- We can settle this...

151
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,200
...here and now, provided you
drop the price sufficiently.

152
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,308
<i>I'm afraid that's out of the question.</i>

153
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:30,741
Well, we'll see what
a couple of drinks can do.

154
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:34,280
- Well, goodbye.
- <i>Goodbye.</i>

155
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,655
- Mr. Fisher?
- Captain Lesgate?

156
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,087
- Yes.
- Won't you come in?

157
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,056
Thank you.

158
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:21,287
It's very good of you.

159
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:23,625
Let me have your coat.

160
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,394
- Have any difficulty finding your way?
- No. None at all.

161
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,437
Do sit down. How about a drink?

162
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,173
I can't help thinking I've seen you
before somewhere.

163
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:35,139
It's funny you should mention that.

164
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,677
The moment I opened
the door, l...

165
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:40,782
Wait a minute. Lesgate?

166
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,510
You're not Lesgate.
Swan. C.J. Swan.

167
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:46,985
- Or was it C.A.?
- C.A.

168
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:49,590
Well, you've got a better
memory than I have.

169
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,784
Fisher.
When did we meet?

170
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,895
- Weren't you at Cambridge?
- Yes.

171
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:55,394
Must be 20 years ago.

172
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:58,124
You wouldn't remember me.
I only came your last year.

173
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,827
- Well, what a coincidence.
- Yes, this calls for a special drink.

174
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:04,598
I was planning to palm you off
with an indifferent port.

175
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:06,332
But let's see what we have here.

176
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:09,342
- How about this?
- Perfect.

177
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:12,978
So how do you know
my car's for sale?

178
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,707
Your garage told me.

179
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:16,818
Odd. I don't think
I mentioned it to them.

180
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,546
I got a fill-up and told them
I wanted an American car.

181
00:12:19,722 --> 00:12:22,657
They gave me your phone number.
I say, it is for sale, isn't it?

182
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,350
- Of course.
- Good, but I refuse to discuss the price...

183
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:27,860
...until you've had three brandies.
- I warn you...

184
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:31,362
...I drive a hard bargain, drunk or sober.
- So do I.

185
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,837
I think I must have seen you
somewhere since we left Cambridge.

186
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,065
Ever been to Wimbledon?

187
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:43,640
That's it.
Wendice. Tony Wendice.

188
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,344
- What's all this about Fisher?
- What's all this about Lesgate?

189
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:52,177
Would you like a cigar?

190
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,515
No, thanks. I'll just stick to my pipe.

191
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,248
That's one habit you've changed.

192
00:12:56,425 --> 00:13:00,225
I remember, at college, you always used to
smoke rather expensive cigars.

193
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:04,025
Wait a minute, I think I have
a picture of you here somewhere.

194
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,758
Yes.

195
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,862
Yes. Here's one.

196
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,598
Taken at a reunion dinner.

197
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:14,334
There you are with the biggest cigar
in the business.

198
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,673
That's the first and last
reunion I ever went to.

199
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:21,647
- What a murderous thug I look.
- Yes, you do rather.

200
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:25,883
Of course, I always remember you
because of the college ball.

201
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,716
You were the treasurer, weren't you?

202
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,916
Honorary treasurer.
I used to organize the beastly things.

203
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:33,721
Some of the ticket money
was stolen, wasn't it?

204
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,864
That's right. Almost £100.

205
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:39,592
I'd left it in a cashbox in my study,
and in the morning, it had gone.

206
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:43,067
- It was the college porter, of course.
- Yes. Poor old Alfred.

207
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,070
He never could back a winner.

208
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:49,405
- They found the cashbox in his back garden.
- But not the money.

209
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:52,477
- Twenty years ago.
- What are you doing nowadays?

210
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,177
I deal in property.
I don't follow tennis very closely.

211
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:59,287
- Do you still play?
- No, I've given it up.

212
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:02,356
Rather, tennis gave me up.
One has to earn a living sometime.

213
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:06,086
And I had a pretty good run for my money.
Went round the world three times.

214
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,662
- What are you doing now?
- I sell sports equipment.

215
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:12,130
It's not very lucrative,
but it gives me plenty of spare time.

216
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:14,861
I see you manage to run
a very comfortable little place.

217
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:16,800
My wife has some money of her own.

218
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:20,271
Otherwise, I should hardly feel
like blowing £1000 on your car.

219
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,634
Eleven hundred.

220
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:25,541
People with capital don't realize
how lucky they are.

221
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:28,078
I'm almost resigned to
living on what I can earn.

222
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,683
You can always marry for money.

223
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:32,616
Yes, I suppose some people
make a business out of that.

224
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,018
- I know I did.
- Why do you think she married you?

225
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,521
Well, I was a tennis star.

226
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:39,684
Yes, but you've given up tennis.
She hasn't left you.

227
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:41,424
She nearly did.

228
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:44,029
After we were married,
I played in championships...

229
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,461
...and took Margot with me.

230
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,625
She didn't like it,
and when we got back...

231
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:51,603
...she tried to make me give up tennis
and play husband instead.

232
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:53,366
In the end, we compromised.

233
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,942
I went alone to America
for the grass-court season...

234
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,670
...and returned after
the national championships.

235
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:02,044
I soon realized a lot had happened
while I was away.

236
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:04,947
For one thing, she wasn't in love
with me anymore.

237
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,056
There were phone calls which would
end abruptly if I happened to walk in.

238
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:13,126
There was an old school friend
who used to visit from time to time.

239
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:15,092
One day, we had a row.

240
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:17,732
I wanted to play in a
covered-court tournament...

241
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,027
...and, as usual,
she didn't want me to go.

242
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:22,534
I was in the bedroom. The phone rang.

243
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:25,196
It all sounded pretty urgent.

244
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:28,343
After that, she seemed rather keen
that I play in the tournament.

245
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,343
So I packed my kit into
the car and drove off.

246
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:36,844
I parked the car two streets away,
walked back in my tracks.

247
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,250
Ten minutes later, she came out
of this house and took a taxi.

248
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:42,356
I took another.

249
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:45,621
Her old school friend
lived in a studio in Chelsea.

250
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:49,730
I could see them through the studio window
as he cooked spaghetti over a gas range.

251
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:53,766
They didn't say much.
They just looked very natural together.

252
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:58,066
You know, it's funny how you
can tell when people are in love.

253
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,299
I went for a walk.

254
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:03,502
I began to wonder what would happen
if she left me.

255
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,944
I'd have to find some way
of earning a living, to begin with.

256
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:10,608
I suddenly realized how much
I'd grown to depend on her.

257
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:14,153
All these expensive tastes
I'd acquired while I was at the top.

258
00:16:14,323 --> 00:16:16,086
Now, big tennis
had finished with me...

259
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:18,419
...and so, apparently,
had my wife.

260
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:21,256
I can't ever remember
being so scared.

261
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,490
I dropped into a pub
and had a couple of drinks.

262
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:29,070
As I sat in the corner,
I thought of all sorts of things.

263
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,866
I thought of three different
ways of killing him.

264
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,236
I even thought of killing her.

265
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,844
That seemed a far more sensible idea.

266
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:39,276
And just as I was working out
how I could do it...

267
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:43,441
...I suddenly saw something
which completely changed my mind.

268
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:49,386
I didn't go to that tournament
after all.

269
00:16:49,558 --> 00:16:53,153
When I got back, she was sitting
exactly where you are now.

270
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:58,265
I'd told her I decided to give up tennis
and look after her instead.

271
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,726
- Well?
- Well, as things turned out...

272
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:02,962
...I needn't have got
so worked up after all.

273
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:06,699
Apparently, their spaghetti evening
had been a sort of a fond farewell.

274
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,002
The boyfriend had been
called back to New York.

275
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:10,577
- An American?
- Yes.

276
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:12,338
There were long letters from there.

277
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:14,379
They usually arrived on Thursdays.

278
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,711
She burned them all except one.

279
00:17:16,885 --> 00:17:19,353
That one she used to transfer
from handbag to handbag.

280
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:21,386
It was always with her.

281
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:23,422
That letter became
an obsession with me.

282
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:25,753
I had to find out what was in it.

283
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:27,759
Finally, I did.

284
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,125
That letter made very interesting reading.

285
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,529
- Do you mean you stole it?
- Yes.

286
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:35,602
I even wrote her two anonymous notes
offering to sell it back.

287
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:37,864
- Why?
- I was hoping it would make her...

288
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,167
...come and tell me all about him.

289
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:43,402
But it didn't,
so I kept the letter.

290
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:48,615
Why are you telling me all this?

291
00:17:48,784 --> 00:17:51,719
Because you're the only
person I can trust.

292
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,856
Anyway, that did it.

293
00:17:57,025 --> 00:18:00,290
It must have put the fear of God
into them because the letters stopped.

294
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:02,930
And we lived happily ever after.

295
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:05,658
You know, it's funny to think
that just a year ago...

296
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:09,167
...I sat in that nice bridge pub
actually planning to murder her.

297
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,666
And I might have done it...

298
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,604
...if I hadn't seen something
that changed my mind.

299
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:17,143
Well, what did you see?

300
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,679
I saw you.

301
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,244
What was so odd about that?

302
00:18:26,421 --> 00:18:27,718
The coincidence.

303
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,154
Only a week before,
I'd been to a reunion dinner.

304
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:32,190
And the fellows
were talking about you.

305
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,522
How you had been court-martialed
during the war.

306
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,164
A year in prison.
That was news.

307
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:41,234
Mind you, at college, we'd all said
that Swan would end up in jail.

308
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:44,429
- That cashbox, I suppose.
- Well, what about it?

309
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:48,042
My dear fellow, everybody knew
you took that money.

310
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,144
Poor old Alfred.

311
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:57,749
Thanks very much for the drink.

312
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,047
Interesting, hearing about your
matrimonial affairs.

313
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,486
I take it you won't be
wanting that car after all.

314
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:05,559
Don't you want me to tell you
why I brought you here?

315
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:08,789
Yes, I think you'd better.

316
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:11,330
It was when I saw you in that pub
that it happened.

317
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,492
Suddenly, everything became quite clear.

318
00:19:15,804 --> 00:19:18,238
A few months before,
Margot and I had made our wills.

319
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:22,173
Short affairs, leaving everything we had
to each other, in case of accidents.

320
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:25,404
Hers worked out at just over £90,000.

321
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,709
Investments mostly,
all a little too easy to get at.

322
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:32,615
And that was dangerous.
They would be bound to suspect me.

323
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:36,280
I need an alibi, a very good one.

324
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,392
Then I saw you.

325
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,393
I'd wondered what happened
to people who came out of prison.

326
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:43,224
People like you, I mean.

327
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:47,528
Can they get jobs?
Do old friends rally round?

328
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:50,137
Suppose they never had any friends.

329
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:53,604
I became so curious to know
that I followed you.

330
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,266
I followed you home that night and...

331
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,142
Would you mind passing me
your glass, old boy?

332
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:01,680
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

333
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,375
- I've been following you ever since.
- Why?

334
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:07,522
I was hoping sooner or later
I might catch you at something...

335
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:10,317
...and be able to...
- Blackmail me?

336
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:11,959
Influence you.

337
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,618
After a couple of weeks,
I got to know your routine...

338
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,356
...and that made it a lot easier.
- Rather dour work.

339
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:19,056
To begin with, yes.

340
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:21,225
But you know how it is.
You take up a hobby.

341
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:24,395
And the more you get to know it,
the more fascinating it becomes.

342
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:26,200
You became quite fascinating.

343
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:30,402
In fact, there were times when
I'd felt that you almost belonged to me.

344
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:32,240
That must have been interesting.

345
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:35,110
You used to go to the dog-racing,
Mondays and Thursdays.

346
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:37,650
I even took it up myself,
just to be near you.

347
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,281
- You'd changed your name to Adams.
- Yes. I got bored with Swan.

348
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:45,585
- Any crime in that?
- No. No. None whatever.

349
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:48,525
In fact, there was nothing
really illegal about you.

350
00:20:48,697 --> 00:20:50,858
I got quite discouraged.

351
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:53,661
Then one day, you disappeared
from your lodgings.

352
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:57,703
I phoned your landlady.
I said, "Mr. Adams owed me £5."

353
00:20:57,873 --> 00:20:59,340
But apparently that was nothing.

354
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:04,002
Mr. Adams owed her six weeks' rent
in her best lodge at £55.

355
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,670
Mr. Adams had been
such a nice gentleman.

356
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:08,978
That's what seemed
to upset her most.

357
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:12,279
Yes. That always seems
to upset them most.

358
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:14,581
I say, old boy,
if you want another drink...

359
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:17,088
...do you mind putting on these gloves?

360
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:19,056
Now, where were we?
Yes, I'd lost you...

361
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,491
...and then I found you
one day at the dog-racing.

362
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:24,791
And I tailed you home to your
new lodgings in Belsize Park.

363
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:27,265
There Mr. Adams became Mr. Wilson.

364
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:30,530
Mr. Wilson left Belsize Park
owing 16 weeks' rent...

365
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,699
...and somewhat richer for a
brief encounter with a Miss Wallace.

366
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,936
You used to take Miss Wallace out
on Wednesdays and Sundays.

367
00:21:38,113 --> 00:21:40,513
She certainly was in love
with you, wasn't she?

368
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:44,675
I suppose she thought you were growing
that handsome mustache to please her.

369
00:21:44,853 --> 00:21:46,753
Poor Miss Wallace.

370
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:49,220
This is all very interesting.
Do go on.

371
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:53,691
July, August, September:
Apartment 127, Carlisle Court.

372
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:55,727
Occupant: a Mrs. Van Dorn.

373
00:21:55,998 --> 00:22:00,230
Her late husband left her two hotels
and a large apartment house, furnished.

374
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,064
What a base to operate from,
Captain Lesgate.

375
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,207
The only trouble is, she does
rather enjoy being courted.

376
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,309
And she's so very expensive.

377
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:11,913
Perhaps that's why you've been trying
to sell her car for over a month.

378
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,241
Mrs. Van Dorn asked me
to sell it for her.

379
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,450
I know. I called her up
just before you arrived here.

380
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:20,053
She only wanted 800.

381
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,885
Where's the nearest police station?

382
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,426
Opposite the church.
Two minutes' walk.

383
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,656
- Suppose I walk there now.
- What would you tell them?

384
00:22:30,832 --> 00:22:32,766
- Everything.
- Everything?

385
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:36,097
All about Mr. Adams
and Mr. Wilson?

386
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,468
I should simply tell them that you
are trying to blackmail me into...

387
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:41,541
Into?

388
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,337
Murdering your wife.

389
00:22:44,246 --> 00:22:45,508
I almost wish you would.

390
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,308
When she heard that,
we'd have the laugh of our lives.

391
00:22:48,483 --> 00:22:50,451
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Am I?

392
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,246
You've told me quite a lot tonight.

393
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:54,389
- What of it?
- Suppose I tell them...

394
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:56,956
...how you followed her
to that studio in Chelsea...

395
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,821
...and watched them cooking
spaghetti and all that rubbish.

396
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:01,895
- Will that ring a bell?
- It would.

397
00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:03,793
They'd assume you'd followed her.

398
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,695
- Me? Why should I?
- Why should you steal her handbag?

399
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:09,462
Why should you write
those blackmail notes?

400
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,401
Can you prove you didn't?

401
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:14,167
You certainly can't prove I did.

402
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:17,072
It'll be a straight case
of your word against mine.

403
00:23:17,245 --> 00:23:20,737
That would puzzle them, wouldn't it.
What could you say?

404
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:24,977
I should say that you came here tonight
half-drunk and tried to borrow money...

405
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,587
...on the strength that we
were at college together.

406
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:31,487
When I refused, you said something
about a letter belonging to my wife.

407
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,390
As far as I could make out,
you tried to sell it to me.

408
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:37,623
I gave you what money I had,
and you gave me the letter.

409
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,462
It has your fingerprints on it, remember?

410
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,037
Then you said if I went to the police...

411
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,837
...you'd tell some crazy story about
my wanting you to murder my wife.

412
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:54,812
Before you go any further, old boy,
do consider the inconvenience.

413
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:56,848
You see, I'm quite well-known.

414
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,543
There'd be pictures of you, as well.

415
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:03,088
And sooner or later, there'd be
a deputation of landladies and lodgers...

416
00:24:03,258 --> 00:24:06,193
...who would step forward to testify
to your character.

417
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:10,661
And someone is almost certain
to have seen you with Miss Wallace.

418
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:14,233
You were careful not to be seen
around with her, I noticed.

419
00:24:14,402 --> 00:24:16,836
You usually met
in out-of-the-way places...

420
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:19,166
...where you wouldn't be recognized.

421
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:22,071
Like the little teashop in Pimlico.

422
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:23,939
That was her idea, not mine.

423
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:25,909
Yes, it was a bit crummy, wasn't it?

424
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:28,515
Hardly the place to take Mrs. Van Dorn.

425
00:24:28,683 --> 00:24:31,311
By the way, does Mrs. Van Dorn
know about Mr. Adams...

426
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:34,353
...and Mr. Wilson and Miss Wallace?

427
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:36,991
You were planning to marry
Mrs. Van Dorn, weren't you?

428
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,150
- Smart, aren't you?
- No, not really.

429
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:41,227
I've just had time
to think things out...

430
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:42,953
...put myself in your position.

431
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:46,430
That's why I know you're going to agree.

432
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:49,001
- What makes you think I'll agree?
- The same reason...

433
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:51,935
...a donkey with a stick behind him
and a carrot in front...

434
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:54,371
...always goes forwards, not backwards.

435
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:57,011
Tell me about the carrot.

436
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,670
One thousand pounds in cash.

437
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:02,646
- For a murder?
- For a few minutes' work, that's all it is.

438
00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:04,751
And no risk, I guarantee.

439
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,683
That ought to appeal to you.

440
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:08,789
You've been skating on pretty thin ice.

441
00:25:08,957 --> 00:25:11,892
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You ought to know.

442
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,051
It was in the papers,
"Middle-aged woman...

443
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:17,027
...found dead due to
an overdose of something."

444
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,258
She'd been taking the stuff
for some time...

445
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,334
...and nobody knows where she got it.

446
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:23,903
But we know, don't we?

447
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:26,472
Poor Miss Wallace.

448
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,472
This £1000...

449
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:33,637
...where is it?

450
00:25:33,815 --> 00:25:36,511
It's in a small attaché case
in a checkroom.

451
00:25:36,685 --> 00:25:39,882
- Where?
- Somewhere in London.

452
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:42,285
Of course, we don't meet again.

453
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,357
As soon as you've delivered the goods...

454
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:48,257
...I shall mail you the checkroom ticket
and the key to the case.

455
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:53,493
You take this £100 on account.

456
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:57,163
The police would
only have to trace one of these notes...

457
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:59,739
...back to you to hang us both
from the same rope.

458
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:03,977
They won't. For a whole year,
I've been cashing an extra £20 a week.

459
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,635
Always in fivers.

460
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,442
I then change them for those
at my leisure.

461
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:12,815
- Might I see your bank statement?
- By all means.

462
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:19,359
Don't touch.

463
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,565
Turn back a page.

464
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:34,869
Your balance has dropped
by over £1000 during the year.

465
00:26:35,043 --> 00:26:36,772
Suppose the police
ask you about that.

466
00:26:36,945 --> 00:26:39,140
I go dog-racing twice a week.

467
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:40,781
They'll check your bookmaker.

468
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:43,076
Like you, I always bet on the tout.

469
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:45,310
Satisfied?

470
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:48,981
When would this take place?

471
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:50,419
Tomorrow night.

472
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,684
Tomorrow! Not a chance!

473
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,453
I've got to think this over.

474
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:56,028
It has to be tomorrow.

475
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,030
I've arranged things that way.

476
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,191
Where?

477
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,269
Approximately where you're standing now.

478
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,800
- How?
- Tomorrow evening, Halliday...

479
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:11,036
...the American boyfriend,
and I will go out to a stag party.

480
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,679
She'll stay here.

481
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:15,941
She'll go to bed early and
listen to theater on the radio.

482
00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:17,641
She always does when I'm out.

483
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:22,085
At exactly three minutes to 11, you'll
enter the house through the street door.

484
00:27:22,257 --> 00:27:24,657
You'll find the key to this door...

485
00:27:27,295 --> 00:27:29,661
...under the stair carpet here.

486
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:32,527
- The fifth step.
- That's the one.

487
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:35,869
Go straight to the window...

488
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:38,863
...and hide behind the curtains.

489
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,702
At exactly 11:00, I'll go
to the telephone in the hotel...

490
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:43,138
...to call my boss.

491
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:45,336
I shall dial the wrong number,
this number.

492
00:27:45,513 --> 00:27:47,344
That's all I shall do.

493
00:27:47,515 --> 00:27:52,145
When the phone rings, you'll see the light
go on under her bedroom door.

494
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,380
When she opens it, the light
will stream across the room.

495
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:58,321
So don't move until
she answers the phone.

496
00:27:58,493 --> 00:28:01,189
There must be as little noise as possible.

497
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:03,331
After you've finished...

498
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:06,296
...pick up the phone and give me
a soft whistle and hang up.

499
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:08,993
Don't speak, whatever you do.
I shan't say a word.

500
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,139
When I hear your whistle,
I shall hang up and redial...

501
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:14,207
...the correct number this time.

502
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:18,107
I shall then talk to my boss as if nothing
had happened and return to the party.

503
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,042
What happens next? Go on.

504
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:22,410
You'll see the suitcase here.

505
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:24,643
It contains clothes of mine
for the cleaners.

506
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:28,346
Open it and tip the clothes
out onto the floor.

507
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:31,219
Then fill it with a cigarette box
and some of these cups.

508
00:28:31,393 --> 00:28:34,385
Close the lid,
but don't snap the locks.

509
00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:36,860
Then leave the suitcase there,
just as it is now.

510
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:38,362
As if I'd left in a hurry.

511
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,297
That's the idea.
Now, the window...

512
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,996
If it's locked, unlock it
and leave it open.

513
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:48,438
Then go out exactly
the same way you came in.

514
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,271
- By this door?
- Yes.

515
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:52,913
And here's the most important thing.

516
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:55,982
As you go out, return the key
to the place where you found it.

517
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,676
- Under the stair carpet?
- Yes.

518
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:01,751
Yes, but what exactly is supposed
to have happened?

519
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:05,154
Well, they'll assume you came in
by the window.

520
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:09,353
You thought the apartment was empty,
so you took the suitcase and went to work.

521
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:11,396
She heard something.

522
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:13,761
She switched on her light.

523
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:17,302
You saw the light under the door
and hid behind the curtains.

524
00:29:17,472 --> 00:29:21,909
When she came in here, you attacked her
before she could scream.

525
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:24,306
When you realized you'd
actually killed her...

526
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:27,778
...you panicked, bolted through
the garden and left the loot behind.

527
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:29,576
Just a minute.

528
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:33,152
I'm supposed to have come in
through these windows.

529
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:36,381
- Suppose they'd been locked.
- It wouldn't matter.

530
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:39,322
She often walks around the garden
before she goes to bed.

531
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:42,554
And she usually forgets to lock up
when she gets back.

532
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,595
That's what I shall tell the police.

533
00:29:44,766 --> 00:29:47,257
Yes, but she may say...

534
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:51,804
But she isn't going to say anything.
Is she?

535
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,007
All right.

536
00:29:57,178 --> 00:29:58,975
I leave the apartment.

537
00:29:59,147 --> 00:30:03,174
I put the key back under the stair carpet
and go out by the street door.

538
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:04,875
Suppose the street door's locked.

539
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,318
- How do I get in in the first place?
- The street door is never locked.

540
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,481
- What time will you get back?
- About 12.

541
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:13,718
I'll bring Halliday back for a nightcap.
We'll find her together...

542
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,295
...and we shall have been together
since we left her.

543
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:18,432
And there's my alibi.

544
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,841
- You've forgotten something.
- What?

545
00:30:35,016 --> 00:30:37,746
When you get back
with what's-his-name, Halliday...

546
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,752
...how will you get in the apartment?
- I shall let myself in.

547
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,947
But your key will be under the stair carpet.

548
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:45,251
He'll see you get it.
It'll give the show away.

549
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,360
No. It won't be my key
under the carpet.

550
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:48,962
It will be hers.

551
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,758
I shall take it from her handbag
and hide it out there...

552
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,764
...just before I leave the flat.

553
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,563
She's not going out,
so she won't miss it.

554
00:30:56,738 --> 00:31:00,572
When I come back with Halliday,
I'll use my own key to let us in.

555
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:04,143
Then, while he's out searching
the garden or something...

556
00:31:04,312 --> 00:31:07,509
...l'll take the key from under the carpet
and return it to her bag...

557
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:11,277
...before the police arrive.
- How many keys are there to this door?

558
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,114
Just hers and mine.

559
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:24,127
- Mavel Z4-double-9.
- <i>Tony, it's me.</i>

560
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,732
Hello, darling. How's it going?

561
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,698
<i>Wonderfully. It's really a dreadful play.</i>

562
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,269
<i>We're enjoying every minute.</i>

563
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:32,906
I'm sorry. I mean, I'm glad.

564
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:35,372
- <i>You will join us, won't you</i>?
- I don't think so.

565
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:37,170
I hardly seem to have started.

566
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:40,280
Darling, just a moment.
I think there's someone at the door.

567
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:42,939
You can be seen
from the bedroom window.

568
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:46,213
Sorry, darling. False alarm.

569
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:48,252
Look, why don't you
take Mark to Gerry's.

570
00:31:48,423 --> 00:31:50,687
- <i>How do we get in</i>?
- Well, just mention my name.

571
00:31:50,858 --> 00:31:53,588
I don't know about the band,
but the food's good.

572
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:55,820
By the way,
Maureen called after you left...

573
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,295
...and wants us
for dinner on Wednesday.

574
00:31:58,466 --> 00:32:02,027
You've got something in your diary
for Wednesday, and I can't read it.

575
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:04,933
Looks like "Al Bentall."

576
00:32:05,106 --> 00:32:07,233
Who's he,
another one of your boyfriends?

577
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,433
<i>Albert Hall, you idiot.</i>

578
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:11,841
The Albert Hall, of course.

579
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,038
I'm so glad we don't have
to go to Maureen's.

580
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:17,241
- She's such a filthy cook.
- <i>Well, there's the bell. I must fly.</i>

581
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:20,046
All right, dear.
Enjoy yourself.

582
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:25,376
Tony, don't make
that martini too watery.

583
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:31,054
Now, where's the picture
of the maharajah?

584
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,987
When are you going to finish
pasting in those clippings?

585
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:37,063
I shall find time one of these days.

586
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:39,631
Here it is.
This is the maharajah.

587
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:42,429
- Isn't he dreamy?
- He had four Rolls-Royces and jewels...

588
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,731
...to sink a battleship, but all he wanted
was to play at Wimbledon.

589
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:49,843
The poor darling was so shortsighted,
he could barely see the end of the racket...

590
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:51,706
...let alone the ball.
- You should...

591
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:53,141
Thanks, Tony.

592
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:55,179
You should write a book about all this.

593
00:33:55,349 --> 00:33:58,978
Why don't you two collaborate,
a detective novel with a tennis background.

594
00:33:59,153 --> 00:34:00,950
What about it, Mark?
You provide me...

595
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,590
...with the perfect murder.
- Nothing I'd like better.

596
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:05,953
How do you go about
writing a detective story?

597
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,221
You forget detection and concentrate
on crime. Crime's the thing.

598
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:12,195
You imagine you're gonna
steal something or murder somebody.

599
00:34:12,366 --> 00:34:14,197
Is that how you do it?
Interesting.

600
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:17,565
I usually put myself in the criminal's shoes
and I keep asking myself:

601
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,400
"What do I do next?"

602
00:34:19,574 --> 00:34:22,543
Do you really believe
in the perfect murder?

603
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,974
Yes, absolutely.
On paper, that is.

604
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,478
I think I could plan one
better than most people...

605
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,309
...but I doubt I could carry it out.

606
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,645
Oh? Why not?

607
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,413
In stories, things turn out
the way the author wants.

608
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:36,614
And in real life,
they don't always.

609
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:39,455
No. I'm afraid my murders
would be like my bridge:

610
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:41,527
I'd make a mistake
and never realize it...

611
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:44,290
...till I find everybody looking at me.
- Drink up, Mark.

612
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:46,763
- Yes.
- What are you doing tomorrow?

613
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,367
- Nothing.
- Why don't we drive...

614
00:34:48,536 --> 00:34:50,629
...to Windsor for lunch.
- That's a good idea.

615
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:52,397
Come along early, but not too early.

616
00:34:52,573 --> 00:34:54,768
- We may be nursing a hangover.
- How about 11?

617
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:57,570
- Fine.
- We can have lunch at the Kings Head.

618
00:34:57,745 --> 00:35:00,646
- Is that right in Windsor?
- No, it's just outside.

619
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:05,352
Did I lend you my latchkey?
I can't seem to find it anywhere.

620
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,818
I don't know. I may have them
both in my handbag.

621
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:09,251
I'll just look.

622
00:35:29,577 --> 00:35:33,377
- No. I've only got one here.
- Are you sure yours isn't in your overcoat?

623
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,846
No, I've looked.
May I borrow yours?

624
00:35:36,017 --> 00:35:38,247
- Well, that's a bit awkward.
- Why?

625
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:40,046
I may want to go out.

626
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,518
Tonight?

627
00:35:41,689 --> 00:35:43,782
Yes, I thought I might go
to a movie.

628
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:46,153
What about the radio?
Saturday Night Theatre?

629
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:49,660
Oh, no. It's a thriller.
I don't like thrillers when I'm alone.

630
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:52,231
- I see.
- In any case, I'll be back...

631
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,163
...before you, so I can let you in.

632
00:35:54,535 --> 00:35:57,766
But we won't be back until after midnight.
You may be asleep by then.

633
00:35:57,939 --> 00:36:00,339
You can always put your key
under the proverbial mat.

634
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:03,671
It's all right. Here it is.
It was in my glove all the time.

635
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:05,938
Well, that settles that.

636
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:08,145
What movie are you going to?

637
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:09,806
The classic, I expect.

638
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:12,782
- Will you get in? Saturday night?
- I can always try.

639
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:15,354
- But, darling...
- Now, don't make me stay home.

640
00:36:15,523 --> 00:36:16,956
You know I hate doing nothing.

641
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:19,388
Doing nothing? There are
hundreds of things to do.

642
00:36:19,627 --> 00:36:21,754
Write Peggy, thanking her
for the weekend.

643
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,762
And what about those clippings?
It's an ideal opportunity.

644
00:36:25,032 --> 00:36:27,398
Well, I like that.
You two go gallivanting...

645
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:30,662
...while I stay home and do
those boring clippings.

646
00:36:31,672 --> 00:36:34,664
- Very well. We won't go.
- What do you mean?

647
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:37,140
It's obvious you don't want us
to go, so we won't.

648
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:38,573
We'll stay here with you.

649
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:40,236
What shall we do, play cards?

650
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:42,881
Tony, darling...

651
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,678
I'll call the Grendon and tell them
we're not coming.

652
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:49,289
Tony, please, let's not
be childish about this.

653
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:53,620
All right, I'll do your
old press clippings.

654
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,059
You don't have to if you
don't want to, you know.

655
00:36:57,231 --> 00:36:59,256
But I do want to.

656
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:05,930
I think I'll try and scare up a taxi.

657
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:07,574
Have we any paste?

658
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:10,336
Yes, there's some in the desk,
I believe.

659
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:14,003
- You need some scissors.
- They're in my mending basket.

660
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:39,766
Lend me some change.
I need some money for the taxi.

661
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:41,465
Hey, you leave
my bag alone.

662
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:44,133
- How much do you need?
- Let's see how much you've got.

663
00:37:44,312 --> 00:37:46,439
- You put that down.
- You owe me 10 bob anyway.

664
00:37:46,614 --> 00:37:47,911
- Why?
- I paid that package...

665
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:50,312
...you sent Peggy.
That comes out of housekeeping.

666
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:52,782
Let me get it, then.
Keep your hands off.

667
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:55,648
There, now.
How much do you want?

668
00:37:55,823 --> 00:37:57,757
I've got 3, 5, 7 and a sixpence.

669
00:37:57,925 --> 00:38:01,190
- It ought to get us there and back.
- But you'd better take something.

670
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,922
- How much are dinner tickets?
- Paid for, tip included.

671
00:38:04,098 --> 00:38:06,396
If I run short,
Mark will help out.

672
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,733
Taxi's here.

673
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,534
Tony, what are you waiting for?

674
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,612
- Nothing, dear.
- Good night, Margot.

675
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,475
What time will you get home?

676
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:23,947
About 12. I'll bring Mark back
for a nightcap.

677
00:38:24,118 --> 00:38:26,086
- Will you be up?
- I shall be fast asleep...

678
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:28,983
...and I don't want to be disturbed.
- We shall be quiet.

679
00:38:29,156 --> 00:38:31,147
- Good night.
- Good night.

680
00:38:35,763 --> 00:38:38,596
- Margot.
- Yes.

681
00:38:38,766 --> 00:38:41,030
You know it's possible
old man Burgess might call.

682
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:43,170
Tell him we're at the Grendon.
It may be important.

683
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:44,599
- What's the number?
- It's in the book.

684
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:46,262
All right.

685
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:51,641
Goodbye, dear.

686
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:56,207
All right, Mark.

687
00:41:07,348 --> 00:41:10,283
I'm staying at the Torbay Hotel.
You know the hotel in Dartmoor?

688
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:13,648
Well, it's not exactly in Dartmoor,
but sort of in the district.

689
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:17,552
Anyway, the whole point of this story
is that it concerns Dartmoor Prison.

690
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:22,050
I was staying at the Torbay Hotel,
as I was saying, I went to the bar...

691
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,066
I turned to him and said,
"What are you doing here?"

692
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:41,146
He says, "I'm a commercial traveler.
I sell agricultural machinery." I said...

693
00:41:41,315 --> 00:41:43,715
Would any of you fellows
have the right time?

694
00:41:43,884 --> 00:41:46,546
Yes, I have seven minutes past 11.

695
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,157
- I make it only just after 11.
- My watch has stopped.

696
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:53,418
- I must have overwound it.
- As I was saying...

697
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,653
Excuse me, old boy.
I have to call my boss.

698
00:41:55,829 --> 00:41:57,091
Agricultural machinery...

699
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:15,035
Hello.

700
00:43:16,944 --> 00:43:19,071
Hello?

701
00:43:21,382 --> 00:43:23,543
Hello?

702
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:30,454
Hello?

703
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,525
Hello?

704
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,687
<i>Hello</i>?

705
00:43:40,434 --> 00:43:41,992
Hello?

706
00:44:43,197 --> 00:44:46,496
<i>Get the police.</i>
<i>Quickly. Police.</i>

707
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:50,496
- Margot?
- <i>Who's there</i>?

708
00:44:50,804 --> 00:44:52,066
Darling, it's me.

709
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:57,343
Oh, Tony.
Tony, thank God.

710
00:44:57,511 --> 00:44:59,103
Come back at once.

711
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,574
- What's the matter?
- <i>I can't explain now.</i>

712
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:06,311
- <i>Come quickly, please.</i>
- Darling, pull yourself together.

713
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:09,479
- What is it?
- <i>A man attacked me.</i>

714
00:45:09,656 --> 00:45:14,559
- <i>Tried to strangle me.</i>
- Did he get away?

715
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,555
<i>No. He's dead.</i>

716
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:26,897
Tony, are you still there?

717
00:45:27,374 --> 00:45:29,604
- Margot.
- <i>Yes</i>?

718
00:45:29,777 --> 00:45:31,244
Now, listen very carefully.

719
00:45:31,412 --> 00:45:33,346
<i>Yes. I'm listening.</i>

720
00:45:33,514 --> 00:45:35,778
Don't touch anything.
I'll be with you right away.

721
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:38,848
- No. No, I won't.
- <i>Don't touch anything...</i>

722
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:42,352
<i>... and don't speak to anybody</i>
<i>until I get there.</i>

723
00:45:42,523 --> 00:45:44,616
No, I won't touch anything.

724
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:47,056
- <i>You promise</i>?
- Yes, I promise.

725
00:45:47,227 --> 00:45:50,196
Tony, please be quick.

726
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,320
I'm sitting at the same bar, and I see
the same man standing at the end of the...

727
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:48,819
He came to me and said...

728
00:46:48,989 --> 00:46:50,889
No, do sit down.
I have to run along.

729
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,548
Margot's not feeling too well.

730
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,023
- Serious?
- Nothing serious.

731
00:46:54,194 --> 00:46:56,059
- You stay and enjoy yourself.
- I'll come.

732
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,754
No. It's perfectly all right.

733
00:46:57,998 --> 00:47:01,195
- with which he was buying me
dry martinis...

734
00:47:30,664 --> 00:47:33,224
Tony!
Oh, Tony.

735
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,130
It's all right, darling.
It's all right. What happened?

736
00:47:36,303 --> 00:47:38,863
He put something around my throat.

737
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:42,668
- It felt like a stocking.
- Are you sure? Let me see.

738
00:47:43,377 --> 00:47:47,313
I got up to answer the phone,
and he came from behind the curtain...

739
00:47:47,481 --> 00:47:49,244
...and tried to strangle me.

740
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:51,782
I almost passed out.

741
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,852
I felt the scissors in my hands...

742
00:47:54,021 --> 00:47:58,617
...and then he let go suddenly,
and he fell on the floor.

743
00:48:28,221 --> 00:48:30,485
There's hardly any blood.

744
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,181
When he fell,
he must have...

745
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:34,725
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to find my...

746
00:48:34,895 --> 00:48:36,556
Here they are, my aspirin.

747
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:39,290
I've got such an awful head...

748
00:48:55,215 --> 00:48:56,614
What is it?

749
00:48:56,783 --> 00:48:58,774
I'd better get a blanket.

750
00:49:13,934 --> 00:49:16,266
Shut the window, please.

751
00:49:16,436 --> 00:49:18,961
No. We mustn't touch anything
until the police arrive.

752
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:22,404
He must've broken in.
I wonder what he was after.

753
00:49:22,576 --> 00:49:25,477
- Those cups, I expect.
- When will the police get here?

754
00:49:26,446 --> 00:49:28,243
- Have you called them already?
- No.

755
00:49:28,415 --> 00:49:30,645
You told me not to speak to anyone.

756
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,482
Hadn't you better
call them now?

757
00:49:34,655 --> 00:49:36,987
Yes.

758
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,656
- Where's Mark?
- I told him to go straight home.

759
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:42,385
- <i>Operator.</i>
- Hello, operator...

760
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:45,258
...get me the Maida Vale Police.
- Did you tell him?

761
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:48,265
I didn't know what had happened.
I said that you weren't well.

762
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:49,732
<i>Maida Vale Police.</i>

763
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,736
Police? There's been
a ghastly accident.

764
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,238
- <i>Yes, sir</i>?
- A man has been killed.

765
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,967
- <i>Your name, sir</i>?
- Wendice.

766
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,845
- <i>Is that a double S</i>?
- No, D-l-C-E.

767
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,909
"C-E."
Your address, sir?

768
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:05,518
<i>61 A Charrington Gardens,</i>
<i>Ground-floor apartment.</i>

769
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:08,587
- Was it an accident?
- I don't know.

770
00:50:09,022 --> 00:50:10,683
What do you mean,
you don't know?

771
00:50:10,857 --> 00:50:13,121
Do you think he might have
been killed by someone?

772
00:50:13,293 --> 00:50:16,057
<i>I don't know.</i>

773
00:50:16,229 --> 00:50:18,959
<i>Have you any idea</i>
<i>who might have done it</i>?

774
00:50:23,136 --> 00:50:25,502
I'll explain when you come.
How long will it take?

775
00:50:25,672 --> 00:50:27,162
- <i>About two minutes.</i>
- Two minutes.

776
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,365
And don't touch anything,
will you, sir?

777
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:31,511
No, we won't touch anything.
Goodbye.

778
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,506
- I'll get dressed.
- Why?

779
00:50:35,682 --> 00:50:38,810
- They'll want to see me.
- They're not going to see you.

780
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:40,418
But they'll ask me questions.

781
00:50:40,587 --> 00:50:43,886
We'll wait until tomorrow.
I'll tell them all they need to know.

782
00:50:44,658 --> 00:50:46,148
- Tony?
- Yes?

783
00:50:46,326 --> 00:50:48,954
- Why did you phone me?
- What?

784
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,958
I'm sorry, darling,
I'll tell you about that later.

785
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,656
I just thought of something.

786
00:50:53,834 --> 00:50:55,324
You said he used a stocking?

787
00:50:55,502 --> 00:50:57,595
I think it was a stocking or a scarf.

788
00:50:57,771 --> 00:51:00,706
- Isn't it there?
- No, but I expect they'll find it.

789
00:51:00,874 --> 00:51:03,001
Now you go on to bed.

790
00:53:39,232 --> 00:53:40,859
Tea, gentlemen?

791
00:53:59,886 --> 00:54:03,219
Sergeant. Look. It's the other stocking.

792
00:54:21,096 --> 00:54:24,793
All right. Break it up.
Let's get moving on.

793
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:50,986
Almost empty.
Remind me to get some more.

794
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,991
It always runs out
just when we need it.

795
00:54:53,162 --> 00:54:55,630
Look, before I forget,
the sergeant wanted to know...

796
00:54:55,798 --> 00:54:57,925
...why you didn't phone
the police immediately.

797
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,931
- How could I? You were...
- I know, but...

798
00:55:00,102 --> 00:55:02,297
You distinctly told me not
to speak to anyone...

799
00:55:02,471 --> 00:55:04,098
...until you got here.
- I know...

800
00:55:04,273 --> 00:55:06,400
...but I told him a slightly different story.

801
00:55:06,575 --> 00:55:08,873
- Why?
- Well, I said you didn't phone the police...

802
00:55:09,044 --> 00:55:12,172
...because you naturally assumed
that I would do it from the hotel.

803
00:55:12,348 --> 00:55:13,610
Why did you say that?

804
00:55:13,782 --> 00:55:17,081
Because it was the perfectly logical
explanation, and he accepted it.

805
00:55:17,253 --> 00:55:20,484
Now, if they get the idea
that we delayed reporting it...

806
00:55:20,656 --> 00:55:23,420
...they might get nosy and ask
all sorts of questions.

807
00:55:23,592 --> 00:55:25,992
- You want me to say the same thing?
- I think so...

808
00:55:26,161 --> 00:55:28,254
...in case it comes up again.

809
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,796
That will be Mark.
Would you let him in?

810
00:55:34,703 --> 00:55:37,433
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning.

811
00:55:37,606 --> 00:55:39,096
- Mrs. Wendice?
- Yes.

812
00:55:39,275 --> 00:55:41,368
I'm a police officer.
May I come in?

813
00:55:41,543 --> 00:55:43,170
Of course.

814
00:55:48,484 --> 00:55:50,714
Excuse me.
I'll just tell my husband you're here.

815
00:55:50,886 --> 00:55:53,184
Thank you.

816
00:56:16,245 --> 00:56:17,769
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

817
00:56:17,946 --> 00:56:21,712
I'm Chief Inspector Hubbard, in charge of
Criminal Investigation of this division.

818
00:56:21,884 --> 00:56:24,148
I think we gave your sergeant
all the information.

819
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,220
Yes. I've seen his report, of course...

820
00:56:26,388 --> 00:56:30,222
...but there are a few things
I'd like to get firsthand.

821
00:56:30,392 --> 00:56:34,123
I gather the sergeant only saw you
for a few moments, Mrs. Wendice?

822
00:56:34,296 --> 00:56:35,888
- Yes, l...
- My wife was suffering...

823
00:56:36,098 --> 00:56:37,395
...from considerable shock.

824
00:56:37,566 --> 00:56:40,364
Yes, that was a very nasty
experience you had.

825
00:56:40,536 --> 00:56:42,094
Mind if I take a look around?

826
00:56:42,271 --> 00:56:45,104
Go ahead. The bedroom and
bathroom are through here.

827
00:56:57,653 --> 00:57:00,679
He certainly didn't get in
by the bathroom.

828
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,952
And the kitchen has bars
on the window.

829
00:57:12,768 --> 00:57:15,635
We assume he must have come in
through these windows here.

830
00:57:15,804 --> 00:57:18,398
I understand you weren't
here when this happened.

831
00:57:18,574 --> 00:57:20,906
No, I was at a dinner party
at the Grendon Hotel...

832
00:57:21,076 --> 00:57:24,409
...and by coincidence, I was phoning
my wife when she was attacked.

833
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,842
So I gather.

834
00:57:26,014 --> 00:57:27,914
Can you tell me exactly
what time it was?

835
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:32,110
No, I'm afraid I can't.
I do remember my watch had stopped.

836
00:57:34,857 --> 00:57:36,950
Did you notice, Mrs. Wendice?

837
00:57:38,227 --> 00:57:41,025
- No, I didn't.
- Won't you sit down, inspector.

838
00:57:41,196 --> 00:57:43,460
Why, thank you.

839
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:47,535
Have you any idea who he was?

840
00:57:49,338 --> 00:57:52,432
Yes. At least,
we've discovered where he lived.

841
00:57:52,608 --> 00:57:55,702
There still seems to be some
confusion as to his real name.

842
00:57:55,878 --> 00:57:57,709
He appeared to have several.

843
00:57:59,148 --> 00:58:01,013
Had you ever seen him before?

844
00:58:01,183 --> 00:58:03,481
Why, no, of course not.

845
00:58:06,188 --> 00:58:07,883
- Is this him?
- Yes.

846
00:58:08,056 --> 00:58:09,990
You don't recognize him?

847
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:11,524
No, I never saw him.

848
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,058
But didn't you even catch
a glimpse of his face?

849
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:17,687
No. You see, he attacked me
from behind, and it was dark.

850
00:58:17,866 --> 00:58:19,595
I hardly saw him at all.

851
00:58:19,768 --> 00:58:21,998
Yes, but before I showed you
these photographs...

852
00:58:22,171 --> 00:58:24,139
...you said you'd never seen him before.

853
00:58:24,306 --> 00:58:27,639
How could you know that
if you never saw his face last night?

854
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:29,141
I don't quite understand.

855
00:58:29,311 --> 00:58:32,007
Inspector, my wife simply means
that as far as she knew...

856
00:58:32,181 --> 00:58:33,648
...she never saw him before.

857
00:58:33,816 --> 00:58:36,182
- Was that what you meant?
- Yes.

858
00:58:36,351 --> 00:58:39,980
Now, how about you, sir?
Had you ever seen him before?

859
00:58:40,155 --> 00:58:41,884
No.

860
00:58:43,826 --> 00:58:46,590
- No, at least...
- Yes?

861
00:58:46,862 --> 00:58:51,196
He's very like someone I was at college
with, but the mustache makes a difference.

862
00:58:51,366 --> 00:58:52,799
What was his name?

863
00:58:52,968 --> 00:58:55,630
I don't know.
It must be 20 years since I left it.

864
00:58:55,804 --> 00:58:59,001
- Was it Lesgate?
- No.

865
00:58:59,174 --> 00:59:01,005
- Wilson?
- No.

866
00:59:01,176 --> 00:59:02,973
- Swan?
- N...

867
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:05,103
Swan.

868
00:59:05,514 --> 00:59:08,142
Wait a minute. Swan.
Yes, that's it.

869
00:59:13,155 --> 00:59:16,454
Here's an old photo taken at a reunion.
We were at the same college.

870
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:19,253
There he is there.
Why, it's unbelievable.

871
00:59:19,428 --> 00:59:22,397
- Did you know him well?
- No. He was senior to me.

872
00:59:22,564 --> 00:59:26,159
- Have you met him since then?
- No, at least...

873
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,735
Come to think of it,
I did see him quite recently.

874
00:59:28,904 --> 00:59:30,769
- But not to speak to.
- When was that?

875
00:59:30,939 --> 00:59:32,770
Six months ago, at a railway station.

876
00:59:32,941 --> 00:59:36,433
Victoria, I think. I remember noticing
how little he'd changed.

877
00:59:36,612 --> 00:59:38,671
Had he a mustache then, sir?

878
00:59:38,847 --> 00:59:39,541
No.

879
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:43,950
Mrs. Wendice, would you show me
exactly what happened last night?

880
00:59:44,586 --> 00:59:48,147
- Tony, do I have to?
- I'm afraid so, darling.

881
00:59:53,795 --> 00:59:55,854
I was in bed when the phone rang.

882
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,589
And I got up, and I came in here.

883
00:59:57,766 --> 00:59:59,666
- Did you switch this light on?
- No.

884
00:59:59,835 --> 01:00:02,565
Just show me exactly where
you were standing.

885
01:00:07,709 --> 01:00:11,008
I stood here,
and I picked up the phone.

886
01:00:11,179 --> 01:00:13,477
Just one moment.
Are you sure you had your back...

887
01:00:13,649 --> 01:00:16,117
...to the window like that?
- Yes.

888
01:00:16,285 --> 01:00:18,753
- But why?
- Why not?

889
01:00:19,288 --> 01:00:21,518
I mean, why go around the desk?

890
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,715
I should have picked it
up from this side.

891
01:00:23,892 --> 01:00:26,019
But I always answer
the phone from here.

892
01:00:26,194 --> 01:00:28,219
But why?

893
01:00:28,397 --> 01:00:32,663
In case I have to write anything down,
I can hold the phone in my left hand.

894
01:00:33,635 --> 01:00:36,297
I see, yes.
I'm sorry. Go on.

895
01:00:36,471 --> 01:00:38,302
When I picked up the phone...

896
01:00:38,473 --> 01:00:41,408
...he must have come from behind
those curtains and attacked me.

897
01:00:41,577 --> 01:00:43,602
- He got something around my neck.
- Something?

898
01:00:43,779 --> 01:00:45,041
What do you mean?

899
01:00:45,213 --> 01:00:46,646
I think it was a stocking.

900
01:00:46,815 --> 01:00:49,215
I see. And what happened then?

901
01:00:49,384 --> 01:00:52,353
Well, then he pushed me
across the desk.

902
01:00:52,521 --> 01:00:54,250
I remember feeling for the scissors.

903
01:00:54,423 --> 01:00:56,357
Where were those
scissors usually kept?

904
01:00:56,525 --> 01:00:59,824
In that mending basket.
I'd forgotten to put them away.

905
01:00:59,995 --> 01:01:03,328
Now, what makes you think
he came from behind those curtains?

906
01:01:03,498 --> 01:01:06,092
- Where else could he have been?
- The curtains were drawn?

907
01:01:06,268 --> 01:01:07,633
- They were.
- Did you draw them?

908
01:01:07,803 --> 01:01:10,067
No, inspector, I drew them
just before I went out.

909
01:01:10,238 --> 01:01:12,468
- Did you lock the window at the same time?
- Yes.

910
01:01:12,641 --> 01:01:14,973
- Are you quite sure of that, sir?
- Perfectly sure.

911
01:01:15,143 --> 01:01:17,043
I always lock up when
I draw the curtains.

912
01:01:17,212 --> 01:01:18,645
How do you suppose
he got in?

913
01:01:18,814 --> 01:01:20,076
We assume that he broke in.

914
01:01:20,248 --> 01:01:21,613
There's no sign of a break-in.

915
01:01:21,783 --> 01:01:24,752
Our report shows
the lock's quite undamaged.

916
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,683
Mrs. Wendice...

917
01:01:26,855 --> 01:01:30,086
...why didn't you call the police
immediately this happened?

918
01:01:34,296 --> 01:01:36,093
I was trying to call to the police...

919
01:01:36,264 --> 01:01:38,459
...when I discovered my husband
was on the line.

920
01:01:38,634 --> 01:01:41,728
I naturally thought that he would
call the police from the hotel...

921
01:01:41,903 --> 01:01:46,363
...before he came here.
- Didn't it occur to you to call a doctor?

922
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:48,907
- No.
- Why ever not?

923
01:01:49,077 --> 01:01:51,910
- He was dead.
- How did you know that?

924
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,411
l...

925
01:01:53,582 --> 01:01:55,516
- It was obvious.
- Did you feel his pulse?

926
01:01:55,684 --> 01:01:57,311
No. Of course I didn't.

927
01:01:57,486 --> 01:01:59,351
Anyone would have
realized he was dead.

928
01:01:59,521 --> 01:02:03,150
- Just one look at those staring eyes...
- So you did see his face after all.

929
01:02:03,325 --> 01:02:06,522
I saw his eyes!
I can't remember his face!

930
01:02:06,695 --> 01:02:09,630
Inspector, my wife obviously
had never seen this man before.

931
01:02:09,798 --> 01:02:12,926
And if he didn't come in by those windows,
how did he get in?

932
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:18,369
As a matter of fact, we're quite certain
that he came in by this door.

933
01:02:19,074 --> 01:02:20,769
But it was locked.

934
01:02:20,942 --> 01:02:24,070
Margot, did you open that door
at all after we'd gone?

935
01:02:24,246 --> 01:02:26,612
- No.
- How many keys are there to this door, sir?

936
01:02:26,782 --> 01:02:30,650
Only two. Mine was in my handbag,
and you had yours with you.

937
01:02:31,053 --> 01:02:32,645
Yes, that's right.

938
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:34,686
- Has the caretaker got a key?
- No.

939
01:02:34,856 --> 01:02:36,380
Do you employ a charwoman?

940
01:02:36,558 --> 01:02:38,219
Yes, but she hasn't got one either.

941
01:02:38,393 --> 01:02:39,826
I'm always here when she comes.

942
01:02:39,995 --> 01:02:42,293
What makes you think
he came in this way?

943
01:02:43,565 --> 01:02:45,556
- His shoes.
- His shoes?

944
01:02:47,002 --> 01:02:48,936
The ground was soaking wet last night.

945
01:02:49,104 --> 01:02:52,631
And if he'd come in by the garden,
he'd have left mud all over the carpet.

946
01:02:52,808 --> 01:02:54,833
As it is, he didn't
leave any marks at all...

947
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:57,342
...because he wiped his shoes
on the front doormat.

948
01:02:57,512 --> 01:02:59,639
- How can you tell?
- It's a fairly new mat...

949
01:02:59,815 --> 01:03:02,079
...and some of its fibers
came off on his shoes.

950
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,616
- But surely...
- And there was a small tar stain...

951
01:03:04,786 --> 01:03:07,346
...on the mat, and some
of the fibers show that as well.

952
01:03:07,522 --> 01:03:08,784
There is no question about it.

953
01:03:10,692 --> 01:03:12,023
Wait a minute.

954
01:03:12,194 --> 01:03:14,662
I think I've got it.

955
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,559
Remember when your bag was stolen?

956
01:03:16,732 --> 01:03:19,667
- Yes.
- Wasn't the key inside?

957
01:03:19,835 --> 01:03:22,099
Yes, but it was still there
when I got it back.

958
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:25,034
Now, just a moment.
I'd like to hear about this.

959
01:03:25,207 --> 01:03:27,072
- What sort of bag?
- A handbag, inspector.

960
01:03:27,242 --> 01:03:29,039
My wife lost it at Victoria Station.

961
01:03:29,211 --> 01:03:31,873
But I got it back from the lost and found
two weeks later.

962
01:03:32,047 --> 01:03:34,948
- Was anything missing?
- All the money was gone.

963
01:03:35,117 --> 01:03:36,482
- Anything else?
- No.

964
01:03:36,651 --> 01:03:39,882
- No papers or letters?
- No.

965
01:03:40,422 --> 01:03:42,913
- Are you quite sure about that?
- Yes.

966
01:03:43,091 --> 01:03:45,719
And your latchkey was in your handbag
when you lost it?

967
01:03:45,894 --> 01:03:48,192
Yes, but it was still there
when it was returned.

968
01:03:48,363 --> 01:03:50,854
But whoever stole the money
could have copied the key.

969
01:03:51,032 --> 01:03:52,761
Where was the bag found eventually?

970
01:03:52,934 --> 01:03:54,993
At Victoria Station.

971
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:58,003
Wasn't that where you said
you saw this man, sir?

972
01:03:58,173 --> 01:03:59,765
When did you lose the bag?

973
01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:02,034
Wasn't it that weekend
we went to visit Peggy?

974
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,700
Yes, it was. I remember now.

975
01:04:03,879 --> 01:04:05,403
He was sitting in the restaurant.

976
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,571
- Was that where you left your bag?
- Yes...

977
01:04:07,749 --> 01:04:10,912
...and didn't I say something about,
"There's someone from college"?

978
01:04:11,086 --> 01:04:13,816
- I don't remember.
- That's how he got in.

979
01:04:13,989 --> 01:04:16,651
He made a duplicate and
returned the original to the bag.

980
01:04:16,825 --> 01:04:20,625
Before you go any further with this,
how did he get in through the street door?

981
01:04:20,796 --> 01:04:24,232
- The street door is never locked.
- I see.

982
01:04:24,399 --> 01:04:27,197
Well, he could have had
your key copied.

983
01:04:27,369 --> 01:04:31,465
And he could have used it
to open the door.

984
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,437
But, of course, he didn't.

985
01:04:34,476 --> 01:04:35,943
- Why not?
- Because if he had...

986
01:04:36,111 --> 01:04:38,511
...the key would still have
been on him when he died.

987
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,877
But no key was found when
we went through his pockets.

988
01:04:45,053 --> 01:04:47,180
We seem to be back
just where we started.

989
01:04:48,356 --> 01:04:50,221
Well, not quite.

990
01:04:50,392 --> 01:04:51,916
Well, then how did he get in?

991
01:04:52,093 --> 01:04:54,721
We'd better get all this down on paper.

992
01:04:54,896 --> 01:04:58,354
I'd like you both to make an official
statement before the inquest.

993
01:04:58,533 --> 01:05:00,296
My office is only
moments from here.

994
01:05:00,468 --> 01:05:02,868
Perhaps you could come now.

995
01:05:05,941 --> 01:05:08,307
- Tony. Marg...
- Mark, this is Inspector Hubbard.

996
01:05:08,476 --> 01:05:11,309
- Inspector, this is Mark Halliday.
- He was with me last night.

997
01:05:11,479 --> 01:05:12,810
- How do you do?
- Mr. Halliday.

998
01:05:12,981 --> 01:05:15,916
As you were with Mr. Wendice last night,
you may help us.

999
01:05:16,084 --> 01:05:19,781
Now, did you notice what time
it was he went to the phone?

1000
01:05:19,955 --> 01:05:22,480
Yes. Matter of fact,
it was three minutes after 11.

1001
01:05:22,657 --> 01:05:24,625
How did you come to notice that?

1002
01:05:24,793 --> 01:05:27,819
Mr. Wendice's watch had stopped.
Some of us compared times.

1003
01:05:27,996 --> 01:05:30,658
Thank you. See, it was when
Mrs. Wendice came in here...

1004
01:05:30,832 --> 01:05:33,562
...to answer his call
that she was attacked.

1005
01:05:34,202 --> 01:05:36,762
Did you phone Margot
before or after your boss?

1006
01:05:36,938 --> 01:05:38,769
Tony, I know what I wanted to ask you.

1007
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:40,601
Why did you telephone me last night?

1008
01:05:40,775 --> 01:05:44,176
Now, just one moment,
before I lose the thread of this.

1009
01:05:44,346 --> 01:05:48,214
Now, at three minutes past 11,
you left your party to phone your boss.

1010
01:05:48,383 --> 01:05:49,873
Yes, I used the lobby pay phone.

1011
01:05:50,051 --> 01:05:52,144
How long were you on
the phone to your boss...

1012
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,753
...before you called your wife?

1013
01:05:53,922 --> 01:05:55,287
I never did speak to him.

1014
01:05:55,457 --> 01:06:00,019
I couldn't remember his number, so I rang
my wife to look it up in the address book.

1015
01:06:00,195 --> 01:06:02,789
You mean, you hauled me out of bed
to get his number?

1016
01:06:02,964 --> 01:06:05,797
I had to. My boss was flying
to Brussels this morning.

1017
01:06:05,967 --> 01:06:08,765
I wanted to remind him of something.
It was rather important.

1018
01:06:08,937 --> 01:06:10,996
Wasn't there a directory
in the hotel?

1019
01:06:11,206 --> 01:06:14,437
Yes, but his country number
wouldn't be in that directory.

1020
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:16,167
- And did you phone him?
- Oh, no.

1021
01:06:16,344 --> 01:06:18,107
When I heard
what happened here...

1022
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:22,080
...I forgot all about it.
- Yes.

1023
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,411
Mr. Halliday,
Mr. and Mrs. Wendice are coming...

1024
01:06:24,586 --> 01:06:26,611
...to my office now
to make their statements.

1025
01:06:26,788 --> 01:06:29,723
Would you give me your address, sir?
I may want to get in touch.

1026
01:06:29,891 --> 01:06:31,654
- Certainly.
- I'll just get my coat.

1027
01:06:31,826 --> 01:06:34,920
- I'm staying at Carfax Hotel.
- Just write it down there, will you?

1028
01:06:35,096 --> 01:06:37,894
Your telephone number
as well.

1029
01:06:45,707 --> 01:06:50,610
- You ever been over here before, sir?
- Yes. Yes, about a year ago.

1030
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:54,374
- There you are, sir.
- Thank you.

1031
01:06:55,183 --> 01:06:57,947
Mr. Wendice, there's quite a crowd
in front of the house.

1032
01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:00,144
I was going to suggest
we left by the garden.

1033
01:07:00,322 --> 01:07:02,290
- Isn't there a gate at the far end?
- Yes.

1034
01:07:02,457 --> 01:07:03,924
The gate may be locked.

1035
01:07:04,092 --> 01:07:07,118
- Would you mind taking a look, sir?
- Certainly.

1036
01:07:13,668 --> 01:07:16,000
How much does he know
about you and Mrs. Wendice?

1037
01:07:17,806 --> 01:07:20,468
- I beg your pardon?
- You wrote a letter to Mrs. Wendice...

1038
01:07:20,642 --> 01:07:24,408
...from New York. It was found
in the dead man's inside pocket.

1039
01:07:24,579 --> 01:07:28,345
I didn't mention it because I wasn't sure
how much Mr. Wendice knew.

1040
01:07:28,516 --> 01:07:30,484
Have you any idea how it got there?

1041
01:07:30,652 --> 01:07:32,347
No.

1042
01:07:34,255 --> 01:07:36,553
- Where's Tony?
- He's just gone into the garden.

1043
01:07:36,725 --> 01:07:39,193
Mrs. Wendice,
when you lost your handbag...

1044
01:07:39,361 --> 01:07:43,024
...did you lose a letter as well?
- No.

1045
01:07:43,198 --> 01:07:46,361
Margot, it was found
in the dead man's pocket.

1046
01:07:46,534 --> 01:07:48,695
You did lose it, didn't you?

1047
01:07:50,338 --> 01:07:51,635
Yes, I did.

1048
01:07:51,806 --> 01:07:53,501
I asked you that before, didn't I?

1049
01:07:53,675 --> 01:07:57,441
Yes, but you see,
my husband didn't know about it.

1050
01:07:57,612 --> 01:07:59,546
This man was blackmailing you,
wasn't he?

1051
01:07:59,714 --> 01:08:01,409
It's no good.
Tony will have to know.

1052
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:03,380
- No.
- It's the only thing we can do.

1053
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:05,348
After Mrs. Wendice
lost my letter...

1054
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,114
...she received these two notes.

1055
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:14,727
Last October?

1056
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:17,093
How many times have you
seen this man?

1057
01:08:17,265 --> 01:08:19,426
I've never seen him!

1058
01:08:19,601 --> 01:08:21,831
- Mr. Halliday, come with us.
- Yes, of course.

1059
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:23,332
Mrs. Wendice...

1060
01:08:23,505 --> 01:08:25,405
...when you make your statement...

1061
01:08:25,573 --> 01:08:27,905
...there may be other
police officers present.

1062
01:08:28,076 --> 01:08:30,340
I shall warn you first
that anything you say...

1063
01:08:30,512 --> 01:08:32,912
...will be taken down
and may be used in evidence.

1064
01:08:33,448 --> 01:08:35,348
Now never mind what you've
told me so far.

1065
01:08:35,517 --> 01:08:37,576
We'll forget all about that.

1066
01:08:37,752 --> 01:08:41,244
But from now on, tell us exactly
what you know about this man...

1067
01:08:41,423 --> 01:08:43,323
...and exactly what happened last night.

1068
01:08:43,892 --> 01:08:46,452
If you try and conceal anything at all...

1069
01:08:46,628 --> 01:08:48,755
...it may put you
in a very serious position.

1070
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:51,023
I wish you'd explain
what you mean by this.

1071
01:08:51,366 --> 01:08:52,890
I will.

1072
01:08:53,068 --> 01:08:55,434
Now, do you admit
that you killed this man?

1073
01:08:55,603 --> 01:08:57,468
Well, you say you did it
in self-defense.

1074
01:08:58,139 --> 01:09:00,039
Unfortunately, there were no witnesses...

1075
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:02,335
...so we've only your word for that.

1076
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:05,775
But I heard it all, inspector,
over the telephone.

1077
01:09:05,947 --> 01:09:08,040
What exactly did you hear, Mr. Wendice?

1078
01:09:08,216 --> 01:09:11,083
I heard a series of faint cries.

1079
01:09:11,252 --> 01:09:14,346
Did you hear anything to indicate
that a struggle was going on?

1080
01:09:14,522 --> 01:09:18,185
What I did hear, inspector, is perfectly
consistent with what my wife told me.

1081
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:23,319
So all you really know of the matter
is what your wife told you, isn't it?

1082
01:09:23,498 --> 01:09:26,490
Now, you suggest that this man
came to burgle your flat.

1083
01:09:26,668 --> 01:09:28,135
But there's no evidence of that.

1084
01:09:28,303 --> 01:09:30,999
There is evidence, however,
that he was blackmailing you.

1085
01:09:32,307 --> 01:09:34,571
- Blackmail?
- Yes, I'm afraid that's true, Tony.

1086
01:09:34,742 --> 01:09:36,801
And you suggest he came in
by the window.

1087
01:09:36,978 --> 01:09:39,344
And we know that he came in
by that door.

1088
01:09:39,514 --> 01:09:42,244
But he can't have come in that way.
That door was locked.

1089
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:43,714
And there are only two keys.

1090
01:09:43,885 --> 01:09:46,353
My husband had his with him.
Mine was in my handbag.

1091
01:09:46,521 --> 01:09:47,954
Here.

1092
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:49,887
You could have let him in.

1093
01:09:50,225 --> 01:09:52,159
Are you suggesting
she let him in herself?

1094
01:09:52,327 --> 01:09:55,296
At present, that appears to be
the only way he could've entered.

1095
01:09:55,463 --> 01:09:57,897
Don't you even believe I was attacked?

1096
01:09:58,066 --> 01:10:00,364
How do you think I got
these bruises on my throat?

1097
01:10:00,902 --> 01:10:03,666
You could have caused
those bruises yourself.

1098
01:10:05,106 --> 01:10:07,870
A silk stocking was found
outside the window.

1099
01:10:08,042 --> 01:10:11,102
It had two knots tied in it.

1100
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:12,746
Does that mean anything to you?

1101
01:10:12,914 --> 01:10:15,382
I suppose it must have been
the stocking he used.

1102
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:19,680
We found the twin stocking
hidden underneath this blotting pad.

1103
01:10:19,854 --> 01:10:22,448
Can you explain why
your attacker should do that?

1104
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:24,420
No.

1105
01:10:24,592 --> 01:10:26,287
Those stockings were yours?

1106
01:10:26,594 --> 01:10:28,960
- No!
- We know they were.

1107
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:33,567
One of the heels had been darned
with some silk that didn't quite match.

1108
01:10:33,735 --> 01:10:36,203
We found a reel of that silk
in your mending basket.

1109
01:10:39,307 --> 01:10:42,242
Tony, there was a pair
of stockings here.

1110
01:10:46,347 --> 01:10:50,716
I've heard of the police deliberately
planting clues to ensure a conviction.

1111
01:10:51,286 --> 01:10:53,083
His men were here for hours last night.

1112
01:10:53,254 --> 01:10:55,916
They could have taken those stockings
and done anything.

1113
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:57,887
Of course.
Probably wiped his shoes...

1114
01:10:58,059 --> 01:10:59,924
...on the doormat as well.
- <i>Hello</i>?

1115
01:11:00,094 --> 01:11:01,823
Hello, Roger, thank heaven you're in.

1116
01:11:01,996 --> 01:11:04,863
Tony Wendice here.
Listen, we had a burglary last night...

1117
01:11:05,033 --> 01:11:07,558
...and Margot was attacked.
- <i>Margot</i>? <i>Was she hurt</i>?

1118
01:11:07,735 --> 01:11:10,636
She's all right, but the man was killed.
The police are here.

1119
01:11:10,805 --> 01:11:14,138
Don't laugh. They are suggesting
that Margot killed him intentionally.

1120
01:11:14,309 --> 01:11:16,140
I wouldn't say that
if I were you, sir.

1121
01:11:16,311 --> 01:11:19,439
- <i>Well, that's a good one.</i>
- Yes, it is funny, isn't it?

1122
01:11:19,614 --> 01:11:22,412
Could you come around at once,
Maida Vale Police Station?

1123
01:11:22,584 --> 01:11:25,052
- <i>Yes, be there right away.</i>
- Thanks, old boy. Goodbye.

1124
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,950
It's all right, darling.
Roger's gonna meet us there.

1125
01:11:28,156 --> 01:11:29,817
Mr. Wendice, I should advise you...

1126
01:11:29,991 --> 01:11:33,222
Our lawyer will give us any advice
we need, thank you.

1127
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:37,088
Margot...

1128
01:11:37,565 --> 01:11:40,932
...here's your handbag.
- Thank you.

1129
01:11:41,102 --> 01:11:43,798
- You are coming?
- But of course, inspector.

1130
01:11:43,972 --> 01:11:47,840
Yes. Well, I just...
I mean, I just wondered.

1131
01:12:05,493 --> 01:12:08,929
<i>I charge you, that on</i>
<i>the 26th of September...</i>

1132
01:12:09,097 --> 01:12:11,930
<i>... you did willfully murder</i>
<i>Charles Alexander Swan.</i>

1133
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:15,331
<i>Do you wish to say anything</i>
<i>in answer to this charge</i>?

1134
01:12:19,107 --> 01:12:22,133
<i>And did you,</i>
<i>at any time in your life...</i>

1135
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:24,801
<i>... meet this man Swan</i>?

1136
01:12:26,047 --> 01:12:29,346
<i>You received a letter</i>
<i>from Mr. Halliday.</i>

1137
01:12:29,517 --> 01:12:32,418
<i>This letter was found</i>
<i>in the dead man's pocket.</i>

1138
01:12:32,587 --> 01:12:35,385
<i>Now you say you did not know him.</i>

1139
01:12:38,026 --> 01:12:42,463
<i>Do you find the prisoner,</i>
<i>Margot Mary Wendice...</i>

1140
01:12:42,864 --> 01:12:46,493
<i>... guilty or not guilty</i>?

1141
01:12:47,135 --> 01:12:49,035
<i>Guilty.</i>

1142
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:57,375
<i>The sentence of this court</i>
<i>is that you be taken to the place...</i>

1143
01:12:57,545 --> 01:13:02,676
<i>... from whence you came, from thence</i>
<i>to a place of lawful execution.</i>

1144
01:13:54,135 --> 01:13:56,831
- Hello, Mark.
- Tony.

1145
01:13:57,872 --> 01:13:59,669
I...

1146
01:14:05,313 --> 01:14:09,340
Have you gotten any news
from the home secretary?

1147
01:14:17,492 --> 01:14:19,858
Then it's tomorrow?

1148
01:14:21,996 --> 01:14:25,625
Tony, I take it you'd do anything
to save her life.

1149
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,598
- We've done everything.
- No, we haven't done everything.

1150
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:30,738
I've been trying to figure out
something...

1151
01:14:30,905 --> 01:14:32,429
...just in case it came to this.

1152
01:14:32,607 --> 01:14:34,336
I really believe
it's her only chance.

1153
01:14:34,509 --> 01:14:36,306
Let's have it.

1154
01:14:36,811 --> 01:14:39,541
Margot was convicted
because nobody believed her story.

1155
01:14:39,714 --> 01:14:41,909
The prosecution made out
she was telling lies...

1156
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:45,075
...and the jury believed him.
What did his case really amount to?

1157
01:14:45,253 --> 01:14:49,212
Just three things:
My letter, her stocking...

1158
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:52,450
...and the fact that because
no key was found on Swan...

1159
01:14:52,627 --> 01:14:53,889
...she must've let him in.

1160
01:14:54,095 --> 01:14:55,619
- Don't tell me...
- Wait a minute.

1161
01:14:55,797 --> 01:14:58,163
Now, hear me out.
This is where you come in.

1162
01:14:58,332 --> 01:15:01,358
Now, you've got to go tell the police
and tell them some story.

1163
01:15:01,536 --> 01:15:04,300
Anything to convince them
Margot wasn't lying after all.

1164
01:15:04,472 --> 01:15:07,236
The police aren't likely
to believe anything I tell them.

1165
01:15:07,942 --> 01:15:10,376
Tony, I've been writing
this stuff for years.

1166
01:15:10,545 --> 01:15:12,809
I've figured out something
for you to tell them.

1167
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:16,677
Now, let's take those points
one by one.

1168
01:15:16,851 --> 01:15:21,413
Margot says she never let
Swan in through this door.

1169
01:15:21,589 --> 01:15:23,386
Okay.

1170
01:15:23,558 --> 01:15:25,355
He must have opened it somehow.

1171
01:15:26,027 --> 01:15:29,554
Suppose you tell the police that you
left your key out here somewhere?

1172
01:15:30,465 --> 01:15:33,195
Then Swan could have let himself in.

1173
01:15:33,367 --> 01:15:36,336
- How did he know it was there?
- You told him.

1174
01:15:36,504 --> 01:15:38,972
But I haven't met Swan in 20 years.

1175
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:41,973
Tony, Swan is dead.

1176
01:15:42,143 --> 01:15:43,667
We've gotta make
the most of that.

1177
01:15:43,845 --> 01:15:46,245
You can tell any story you like.
You can even say...

1178
01:15:46,414 --> 01:15:49,941
...you two met somewhere and
planned this whole thing together.

1179
01:15:50,117 --> 01:15:52,017
Planned what?

1180
01:15:52,186 --> 01:15:54,882
Are you suggesting I arranged
for Swan to come here...

1181
01:15:55,056 --> 01:15:57,786
...to blackmail her?
- No.

1182
01:15:57,959 --> 01:16:00,018
To kill her.

1183
01:16:00,261 --> 01:16:03,059
- Kill Margot?
- That's it.

1184
01:16:03,231 --> 01:16:06,098
- Why?
- Because she said so.

1185
01:16:07,068 --> 01:16:10,265
"He came from behind the curtain...

1186
01:16:10,438 --> 01:16:12,269
...and he tried to strangle me."

1187
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,135
Okay, that's what he did.

1188
01:16:14,308 --> 01:16:15,969
Just support everything she said.

1189
01:16:16,143 --> 01:16:17,770
Don't you see?
That's my whole idea.

1190
01:16:17,945 --> 01:16:19,469
What about your letter?

1191
01:16:19,647 --> 01:16:21,638
A man doesn't kill the person
he blackmails.

1192
01:16:21,816 --> 01:16:24,307
- That doesn't make sense.
- I know. It worried me too.

1193
01:16:24,485 --> 01:16:26,544
But I've got that licked.

1194
01:16:26,721 --> 01:16:30,657
You tell them that you stole
her handbag yourself.

1195
01:16:30,825 --> 01:16:33,658
Why should I do that?

1196
01:16:33,828 --> 01:16:35,659
Because you wanted
to read my letter.

1197
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:38,765
When you read it, you got mad
and decided to teach her a lesson.

1198
01:16:38,933 --> 01:16:40,491
You wrote those blackmail notes.

1199
01:16:40,668 --> 01:16:42,101
Nobody can prove you didn't.

1200
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:45,398
And you can also say you never
saw Swan at Victoria Station.

1201
01:16:45,573 --> 01:16:48,371
You just invented that to try
to connect him with my letter.

1202
01:16:48,543 --> 01:16:50,204
You see how
it all hangs together?

1203
01:16:50,378 --> 01:16:52,812
But your letter was found in his pocket.

1204
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:55,414
- You put it there.
- When?

1205
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:58,009
Sometime before the police arrived.

1206
01:17:00,555 --> 01:17:02,989
And you could have also...

1207
01:17:04,358 --> 01:17:06,292
...planted the stockings
at the same time.

1208
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:09,054
Mark, why should I want
anyone to kill Margot?

1209
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:10,720
I know, Tony.

1210
01:17:10,898 --> 01:17:13,423
It's tough for us to see
because we...

1211
01:17:13,601 --> 01:17:15,728
We both love her.

1212
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,461
But we need a reason now.

1213
01:17:17,638 --> 01:17:19,572
We need it badly!

1214
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:24,437
Let's take one of
the old stock motives.

1215
01:17:24,612 --> 01:17:27,547
- Had Margot made a will?
- Yes, I believe she had.

1216
01:17:27,715 --> 01:17:30,513
- Who was the beneficiary?
- Why, I am, I suppose.

1217
01:17:30,685 --> 01:17:33,313
- There's your reason!
- Thousand of husbands and wives...

1218
01:17:33,487 --> 01:17:36,183
...leave money to each other
without murdering each other.

1219
01:17:36,357 --> 01:17:39,292
The police wouldn't believe it.
They'd take it as a man...

1220
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:41,257
...trying desperately to save his wife.

1221
01:17:41,429 --> 01:17:43,920
Well, I certainly think it's worth that try.

1222
01:17:44,098 --> 01:17:47,067
Face it, they can't hang you
for a murder that never came off.

1223
01:17:47,234 --> 01:17:49,600
The most you'd get would be
a few years in prison.

1224
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:51,795
Thanks very much.

1225
01:17:51,973 --> 01:17:54,271
It's a small price to pay.
You'd save her life!

1226
01:17:54,475 --> 01:17:56,841
That's fine coming from you, Mark.

1227
01:17:57,011 --> 01:18:00,174
Her life wouldn't be in danger at all
if it hadn't been for you.

1228
01:18:00,815 --> 01:18:03,181
It's because of her association with you...

1229
01:18:03,351 --> 01:18:05,819
...that she lost the sympathy of the jury.

1230
01:18:06,754 --> 01:18:08,483
Don't get me wrong, Mark.

1231
01:18:08,656 --> 01:18:11,989
If there was the slightest chance
of this coming off, I'd do it.

1232
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:14,286
But it's got to be convincing.

1233
01:18:14,462 --> 01:18:17,829
For instance, how could I have
persuaded Swan to do a thing like this?

1234
01:18:17,999 --> 01:18:19,591
You offered him money or something.

1235
01:18:19,767 --> 01:18:21,098
What money? I don't have any.

1236
01:18:21,268 --> 01:18:22,633
Yes! You'd have had Margot's.

1237
01:18:22,803 --> 01:18:25,271
It would be months before
I get my hands on that.

1238
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:28,499
And people don't
commit murder on credit.

1239
01:18:28,676 --> 01:18:33,238
No, I'm... I'm afraid you'll have to
think of something better than that.

1240
01:18:34,448 --> 01:18:36,609
I know you're trying to help.

1241
01:18:36,784 --> 01:18:39,309
But can you imagine anyone
believing a story like that?

1242
01:18:39,487 --> 01:18:42,183
Yes, I can.
If you make them believe it!

1243
01:18:43,157 --> 01:18:45,057
I wouldn't know what to say.
Come with me.

1244
01:18:45,226 --> 01:18:47,626
That would be a mistake.
They know the stuff I write.

1245
01:18:47,795 --> 01:18:50,093
We wouldn't stand a chance...

1246
01:18:59,273 --> 01:19:01,673
Hello, inspector.

1247
01:19:07,281 --> 01:19:08,942
Is it about my wife?

1248
01:19:09,784 --> 01:19:12,753
- No, sir, I'm afraid not.
- Then what is it?

1249
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,822
I'm making inquiries in connection
with a robbery that took place...

1250
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:20,518
...about three weeks ago, sir.
- Can't it wait a few days?

1251
01:19:20,695 --> 01:19:23,562
Of course, sir.
I'm very conscious of your position.

1252
01:19:23,731 --> 01:19:26,529
If I may, I'd like to say
how deeply sorry I am...

1253
01:19:26,701 --> 01:19:29,226
Yes, inspector, all right.
Now, how can I help you?

1254
01:19:29,437 --> 01:19:33,066
The cashier of a factory in Ledbury Street
was attacked in his office...

1255
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,936
...and two men made off
with several hundred pounds...

1256
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:37,668
...mostly in pound notes.

1257
01:19:37,845 --> 01:19:39,335
What is all this to do with me?

1258
01:19:39,513 --> 01:19:42,573
In these cases, all police divisions
are asked to keep a lookout...

1259
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:44,741
...for anyone spending
large sums of money.

1260
01:19:44,919 --> 01:19:47,285
- I see.
- And I was wondering...

1261
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:51,858
...if you'd sold anything recently for cash.
- Why?

1262
01:19:52,693 --> 01:19:54,957
My sergeant happened to be
making inquiries...

1263
01:19:55,129 --> 01:19:58,565
...at Wales' Garage the other day,
and it appears that you...

1264
01:19:58,733 --> 01:20:01,031
...settled an account there recently for...

1265
01:20:02,103 --> 01:20:03,627
...just over £60.

1266
01:20:03,804 --> 01:20:05,897
Yes, I happened to have
quite a bit on me...

1267
01:20:06,073 --> 01:20:07,472
...so I settled for cash.

1268
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:11,902
I see. Had you just drawn
this money from your bank?

1269
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:14,240
Have you been to my bank, inspector?

1270
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:17,851
Yes, as a matter of fact, I have.
But they wouldn't help me.

1271
01:20:18,018 --> 01:20:20,612
Bank statements are always
jealously guarded.

1272
01:20:20,788 --> 01:20:23,518
Yes, but I'm rather surprised
you didn't come to me first.

1273
01:20:23,691 --> 01:20:25,921
It was only a routine matter after all.

1274
01:20:26,093 --> 01:20:27,924
I didn't want
to disturb you.

1275
01:20:30,498 --> 01:20:32,193
Where did you get it, sir?

1276
01:20:32,366 --> 01:20:33,697
Is that any of your business?

1277
01:20:33,868 --> 01:20:36,735
If it was stolen money,
yes, sir, it is my business.

1278
01:20:36,904 --> 01:20:39,338
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Go ahead.

1279
01:20:39,673 --> 01:20:42,107
Do you really think
I've been receiving stolen money?

1280
01:20:42,276 --> 01:20:45,939
Until you tell me where you got it,
I shan't know what to think, shall I?

1281
01:20:46,113 --> 01:20:49,605
You see, if you got this money
from someone you didn't know...

1282
01:20:49,784 --> 01:20:53,242
...I mean, that might be the very person
we're looking for.

1283
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:55,354
Hello.

1284
01:20:56,524 --> 01:20:57,821
- Is this yours?
- What is it?

1285
01:20:57,992 --> 01:21:01,450
Somebody's latchkey.
It was lying on the floor just here.

1286
01:21:04,532 --> 01:21:06,762
No. Mine's here.

1287
01:21:11,906 --> 01:21:13,635
No. No, it's not yours.

1288
01:21:13,808 --> 01:21:15,503
It may be mine, then.

1289
01:21:19,246 --> 01:21:21,146
Yes.
Yes, it is mine.

1290
01:21:21,315 --> 01:21:24,580
It must have dropped out of the pocket.
There's a small hole there.

1291
01:21:24,752 --> 01:21:28,279
That's the trouble with these latchkeys,
they're all alike.

1292
01:21:28,455 --> 01:21:31,185
- Sorry, sir, you were saying?
- I don't think I was, was I?

1293
01:21:31,358 --> 01:21:32,848
Yes, yes. About that money.

1294
01:21:33,027 --> 01:21:35,552
I'd be grateful if you'd tell me
where you got it.

1295
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:37,788
A hundred pounds
is a lot to carry around.

1296
01:21:37,965 --> 01:21:40,957
- You said 60 a moment ago.
- Did I?

1297
01:21:41,135 --> 01:21:44,593
Oh, yes. Yes, my sergeant
decided to dig a little deeper...

1298
01:21:44,772 --> 01:21:46,296
...before he put in his report.

1299
01:21:46,574 --> 01:21:49,270
He said that you also paid
a bill at your tailor's...

1300
01:21:49,443 --> 01:21:51,206
...and another for wines and spirits.

1301
01:21:51,378 --> 01:21:55,075
I'm sorry he went to that trouble. Had he
come to me, I could have explained it.

1302
01:21:55,249 --> 01:21:58,116
I simply won rather a large sum
at dog-racing.

1303
01:21:58,285 --> 01:22:00,810
- Over £100?
- Yes. Over £100.

1304
01:22:00,988 --> 01:22:02,979
It has been done before, you know.

1305
01:22:03,157 --> 01:22:05,489
Why didn't you tell me this straightaway?

1306
01:22:05,659 --> 01:22:08,219
I was ashamed of being caught
going to dog-racing...

1307
01:22:08,395 --> 01:22:10,522
...when my wife was under
sentence of death.

1308
01:22:10,698 --> 01:22:14,964
Yes, I know how it is.
It helps take your mind off things.

1309
01:22:15,135 --> 01:22:17,228
Well, that answers
everything, doesn't it?

1310
01:22:17,404 --> 01:22:19,201
I'm sorry to bother you at this time.

1311
01:22:19,373 --> 01:22:21,864
Not at all, inspector. Not at all.

1312
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:29,481
There's just one other thing, sir.

1313
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:32,551
Have you a small, blue attaché case?

1314
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:35,018
- You found it already.
- Why, have you lost it?

1315
01:22:35,189 --> 01:22:37,214
Yes. I was going to
report it this afternoon.

1316
01:22:37,391 --> 01:22:39,859
- I think I left it in a taxi.
- I see.

1317
01:22:40,361 --> 01:22:43,421
We must try and get it back,
mustn't we?

1318
01:22:43,597 --> 01:22:45,326
Where did you pick the taxi up, sir?

1319
01:22:45,499 --> 01:22:47,831
Hyde Park Corner,
about half an hour ago.

1320
01:22:48,002 --> 01:22:50,334
- Anything valuable?
- No. A few books and...

1321
01:22:50,504 --> 01:22:52,972
- Any money?
- Two or three pounds in an envelope.

1322
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,938
- Not 200 or 300?
- No, I'm afraid not.

1323
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:58,169
- Just as well.
- Tell me, inspector...

1324
01:22:58,345 --> 01:23:00,438
...how'd you find out
about the attaché case?

1325
01:23:00,614 --> 01:23:03,174
The wine shop said you had it
when you paid your bill...

1326
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:05,841
...so my sergeant checked
on your garage and tailor.

1327
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:08,113
They remembered you had it
when you paid them.

1328
01:23:08,289 --> 01:23:10,757
Yes, well, I use it instead
of a briefcase, you see.

1329
01:23:10,925 --> 01:23:13,951
These taxi men are pretty good
at turning things in.

1330
01:23:14,128 --> 01:23:16,062
I hope you'll find it
all right, sir.

1331
01:23:18,365 --> 01:23:21,391
Inspector, before you go...

1332
01:23:21,568 --> 01:23:24,560
...I think Mr. Wendice
has something to tell you.

1333
01:23:25,139 --> 01:23:27,300
Oh, has he?

1334
01:23:27,474 --> 01:23:30,409
And I'd like to show you
something in here, sir.

1335
01:23:40,254 --> 01:23:43,087
No wonder you couldn't bear
to sleep in her bedroom.

1336
01:23:43,257 --> 01:23:46,226
There must be over £500 here.

1337
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:50,489
Where did you get it?

1338
01:23:50,664 --> 01:23:52,529
I can tell you why he got it.

1339
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:55,032
This money was to
have been paid to Swan...

1340
01:23:55,202 --> 01:23:57,102
...after he murdered Mrs. Wendice.

1341
01:23:57,271 --> 01:23:59,239
But as you know,
there was an accident...

1342
01:23:59,406 --> 01:24:01,806
...so it wasn't necessary
to pay Swan after all.

1343
01:24:01,976 --> 01:24:04,672
He couldn't produce this
without questions being asked...

1344
01:24:04,845 --> 01:24:06,335
...so he lived on it.

1345
01:24:06,513 --> 01:24:09,277
He's been living on it
since the 27th of March.

1346
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:11,213
Well, Mr. Wendice?

1347
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:13,876
Before you came,
he was trying to persuade me...

1348
01:24:14,054 --> 01:24:18,047
...to go to the police with the
most fantastic story you ever heard.

1349
01:24:18,225 --> 01:24:21,922
Apparently, I bribed Swan
to murder my wife so that...

1350
01:24:22,096 --> 01:24:23,859
Correct me if I go wrong, Mark.

1351
01:24:24,031 --> 01:24:26,329
So that I could inherit all her money.

1352
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,865
And that isn't all.

1353
01:24:28,035 --> 01:24:30,663
You remember Mr. Halliday's letter?

1354
01:24:30,838 --> 01:24:33,807
Well, apparently,
Swan didn't steal it, I did.

1355
01:24:33,974 --> 01:24:36,067
And I wrote those
two blackmail notes...

1356
01:24:36,243 --> 01:24:40,077
...and I kept Mr. Halliday's letter
and planted it on the body.

1357
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:42,878
- And the stocking...
- Yes, the stocking.

1358
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:45,746
I'd better tell this.
It sounds more like a confession.

1359
01:24:45,919 --> 01:24:48,752
I substituted... Is that the right word?

1360
01:24:48,922 --> 01:24:52,881
Yes, I substituted my wife's
other stocking for the one that...

1361
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:56,587
You do follow me, don't you?
What else, Mark?

1362
01:24:56,764 --> 01:25:00,291
He told Swan he'd hide his key
somewhere out here...

1363
01:25:00,467 --> 01:25:03,493
...probably up on this ledge.

1364
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:05,661
Swan let himself in.

1365
01:25:05,839 --> 01:25:08,433
He hid behind the curtains,
then Wendice telephoned.

1366
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:10,201
- That brought her...
- One moment.

1367
01:25:10,377 --> 01:25:13,869
If Swan had used Mr. Wendice's key,
it would have been on him when he died.

1368
01:25:14,048 --> 01:25:17,779
Besides, how did Mr. Wendice get in
when he returned from the hotel?

1369
01:25:17,951 --> 01:25:19,714
She could have let him in.

1370
01:25:19,887 --> 01:25:22,947
He could've taken his key
from Swan's pocket before you got here.

1371
01:25:23,123 --> 01:25:26,183
He let himself in with his own key.
That came out in the trial.

1372
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:30,160
- Don't you remember?
- Come on, Mark. Your move.

1373
01:25:34,935 --> 01:25:37,495
Swan could have taken the key
down from here...

1374
01:25:37,671 --> 01:25:39,434
...unlocked the door...

1375
01:25:39,606 --> 01:25:42,200
...then replaced the key
on the ledge before he came in.

1376
01:25:42,376 --> 01:25:45,470
This is all very interesting,
but it isn't getting me any nearer...

1377
01:25:45,646 --> 01:25:47,045
...to what I came to find out.

1378
01:25:47,214 --> 01:25:49,739
But this is life-and-death.
What else matters?

1379
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:52,510
What matters to me is where
Mr. Wendice got this money.

1380
01:25:52,686 --> 01:25:53,948
That's all I want to know.

1381
01:26:01,895 --> 01:26:04,455
Just a moment. Please, sir.

1382
01:26:09,002 --> 01:26:12,028
Inspector, wait a minute!
Look at this.

1383
01:26:12,206 --> 01:26:14,572
The last check he wrote
was on the 26th of March.

1384
01:26:14,741 --> 01:26:18,177
That's the day before this all happened.
He's been living off it since.

1385
01:26:18,345 --> 01:26:20,438
- That's his bank's...
- Mr. Halliday.

1386
01:26:20,614 --> 01:26:22,912
Sorry.

1387
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:29,289
He hasn't drawn any large sums
from his bank. Nothing over £53.

1388
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:33,350
But look, inspector...

1389
01:26:33,527 --> 01:26:38,089
...practically every week,
£35, 40, 45, 50.

1390
01:26:38,265 --> 01:26:39,562
He could have saved it up.

1391
01:26:39,733 --> 01:26:41,860
I could have been planning
all this for years.

1392
01:26:42,035 --> 01:26:45,368
- Then where did you get it?
- Do you really want to know?

1393
01:26:45,539 --> 01:26:48,064
- I warn you. You won't like it, Mark.
- Come on.

1394
01:26:49,276 --> 01:26:51,141
All right, you asked for it.

1395
01:26:51,311 --> 01:26:53,745
When she called me back
from the party that night...

1396
01:26:53,914 --> 01:26:57,213
...I found her kneeling beside Swan's body,
going through his pockets.

1397
01:26:57,384 --> 01:27:01,115
She kept saying he had something
of hers, but she couldn't find it.

1398
01:27:01,288 --> 01:27:04,724
She was almost hysterical. That's why
I wouldn't let police question her.

1399
01:27:04,892 --> 01:27:08,328
In the state she was in, she would have
told every lie under the sun.

1400
01:27:08,495 --> 01:27:10,486
The next morning,
she showed me the money...

1401
01:27:10,664 --> 01:27:12,689
...just as it is now,
all in £1 notes.

1402
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:17,201
And she said, "If anything happens
to me, don't let them find this."

1403
01:27:18,071 --> 01:27:21,234
Well, after she was arrested,
I took the money in that case...

1404
01:27:21,408 --> 01:27:24,206
...to Charing Cross Station
and left it in the checkroom.

1405
01:27:24,378 --> 01:27:26,346
Whenever I needed money,
I took it out...

1406
01:27:26,513 --> 01:27:29,004
...and left it in some other checkroom.

1407
01:27:29,183 --> 01:27:32,448
I knew if you had found it,
she wouldn't stand a chance.

1408
01:27:32,619 --> 01:27:36,715
You see, she was just about to give it
to him when she killed him instead.

1409
01:27:37,524 --> 01:27:39,958
You don't expect anyone
to believe this, do you?

1410
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:43,056
I have really no idea.
What about it, inspector?

1411
01:27:45,499 --> 01:27:47,899
I must say,
I suspected something like that.

1412
01:27:48,702 --> 01:27:51,796
You're not going to check up on this?
She's being hanged tomorrow.

1413
01:27:51,972 --> 01:27:54,133
All this has been out
of my hands for months.

1414
01:27:54,308 --> 01:27:57,971
- There's been a trial and an appeal...
- Of course it wouldn't mean much to you.

1415
01:27:58,145 --> 01:28:00,579
You'd have to admit
you arrested the wrong person.

1416
01:28:02,316 --> 01:28:06,309
- I think you'd better go.
- You bet I'll go.

1417
01:28:08,589 --> 01:28:10,580
But you've made one mistake.

1418
01:28:10,757 --> 01:28:12,748
What will happen
when Margot hears this?

1419
01:28:12,926 --> 01:28:15,895
- She'll deny it, of course.
- And perhaps she'll change her will.

1420
01:28:16,063 --> 01:28:19,089
You'll have done it all
for nothing, Tony.

1421
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:26,132
If I'd told that story of his,
would anyone believe me?

1422
01:28:26,974 --> 01:28:28,498
No, not a chance.

1423
01:28:28,675 --> 01:28:32,907
Before nearly every execution,
someone comes forward like this.

1424
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:35,071
This must have been distressing for you...

1425
01:28:35,249 --> 01:28:37,809
...coming as it did.
- You suppose they let him see her?

1426
01:28:37,985 --> 01:28:39,714
I don't want her upset just now.

1427
01:28:39,886 --> 01:28:43,049
Have a word with your lawyer.
He might be able to prevent it.

1428
01:28:43,257 --> 01:28:46,283
You should get that money in the bank
before somebody pinches it.

1429
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:48,223
Thank you. I think I will.

1430
01:28:49,596 --> 01:28:52,497
I hope Mr. Halliday's not
waiting outside to see me.

1431
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:56,227
Would you mind just taking a look, sir,
to make sure he's gone?

1432
01:29:06,013 --> 01:29:07,275
- All clear.
- Good.

1433
01:29:08,081 --> 01:29:10,743
By the way, sir,
I was asked to tell you...

1434
01:29:10,917 --> 01:29:13,750
...there are a few belongings
of Mrs. Wendice at the station.

1435
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,185
- What sort of things?
- Just books and a handbag.

1436
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:19,222
They'd like you to come
and collect them.

1437
01:29:19,426 --> 01:29:22,418
- You mean, after tomorrow?
- Yes, or today if you like.

1438
01:29:22,596 --> 01:29:25,360
Just ask the desk sergeant.
He knows all about it.

1439
01:29:25,532 --> 01:29:28,865
Well, goodbye, Mr. Wendice.
I don't suppose we shall meet again.

1440
01:29:29,036 --> 01:29:32,870
Goodbye, inspector,
and thank you very much.

1441
01:31:19,846 --> 01:31:21,746
- <i>Maida Vale Police.</i>
- Chief inspector here.

1442
01:31:21,915 --> 01:31:24,110
Give me Sergeant O'Brien,
quick.

1443
01:31:24,284 --> 01:31:25,546
- <i>O'Brien here.</i>
- Hubbard.

1444
01:31:25,719 --> 01:31:27,880
Look, O'Brien,
I've got back in again.

1445
01:31:28,054 --> 01:31:31,217
- Start the ball rolling.
- <i>Right away, sir.</i>

1446
01:31:42,302 --> 01:31:44,099
Inspector Hubbard.

1447
01:31:44,271 --> 01:31:46,330
It's me, Mark Halliday.

1448
01:31:48,175 --> 01:31:50,405
Now what are you up to?
What's the idea?

1449
01:31:50,577 --> 01:31:52,101
- What are you doing?
- Never mind.

1450
01:31:52,279 --> 01:31:54,076
- I was wondering why...
- Get out of here.

1451
01:31:54,247 --> 01:31:55,612
- Listen, inspector...
- Shut up!

1452
01:31:55,782 --> 01:31:58,751
If you want to save Mrs. Wendice,
keep quiet. Let me handle this.

1453
01:31:58,919 --> 01:32:00,546
How are you possibly going to...?

1454
01:33:27,274 --> 01:33:29,105
Look, what is all this?

1455
01:33:29,276 --> 01:33:31,244
They talk about
flatfooted policemen.

1456
01:33:31,411 --> 01:33:35,211
May the saints protect us
from the gifted amateur.

1457
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:49,417
You'd better prepare yourself
for a surprise, Mr. Halliday.

1458
01:33:57,203 --> 01:33:58,830
Margot!

1459
01:34:01,207 --> 01:34:03,368
Hello, Mark.

1460
01:34:04,244 --> 01:34:06,940
- Where's Tony?
- He...

1461
01:34:07,113 --> 01:34:10,241
- He's gone out.
- When will he be back?

1462
01:34:10,417 --> 01:34:12,214
We're not sure.

1463
01:34:12,385 --> 01:34:15,843
- Was that you who rang just now?
- Yes.

1464
01:34:16,022 --> 01:34:18,456
- Why didn't you let me in?
- You've got a key.

1465
01:34:18,625 --> 01:34:20,525
- Why didn't you use it?
- I did...

1466
01:34:20,694 --> 01:34:24,255
...but it didn't fit the lock.
- You know why, don't you?

1467
01:34:24,431 --> 01:34:27,525
No, I don't.
Has the lock been changed?

1468
01:34:27,701 --> 01:34:30,261
May I have your bag a moment?

1469
01:34:35,809 --> 01:34:37,970
Whose key is this?

1470
01:34:38,144 --> 01:34:40,078
I thought it was mine.

1471
01:34:40,246 --> 01:34:42,214
I don't know.

1472
01:34:47,988 --> 01:34:49,478
What's going on here?

1473
01:34:55,128 --> 01:34:57,028
Your husband's explained this,
you know.

1474
01:34:57,430 --> 01:34:59,660
You can tell us
all about it now.

1475
01:34:59,833 --> 01:35:01,596
What is it?

1476
01:35:01,768 --> 01:35:03,065
I don't understand.

1477
01:35:03,737 --> 01:35:07,195
No, I don't believe you do.

1478
01:35:10,477 --> 01:35:12,877
- Pearson.
- Yes, sir.

1479
01:35:13,446 --> 01:35:15,607
Take this handbag back
to the police station...

1480
01:35:15,782 --> 01:35:18,012
...and get that car out of the way.
- Yes, sir.

1481
01:35:18,184 --> 01:35:21,483
Wait a minute, you clod. You can't
walk down the street like that.

1482
01:35:21,655 --> 01:35:25,250
You'll be arrested.
Here, put it in this.

1483
01:35:25,659 --> 01:35:27,786
Margot,
how did you get here?

1484
01:35:27,961 --> 01:35:29,826
I don't know.

1485
01:35:30,964 --> 01:35:33,933
About an hour ago,
the warden came to see me...

1486
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:36,728
...and just said I was
to be taken home.

1487
01:35:36,903 --> 01:35:39,565
Then two detectives
brought me here.

1488
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:45,307
They said I could go,
but I couldn't get that door open.

1489
01:35:46,112 --> 01:35:47,739
Where's Tony?

1490
01:35:47,914 --> 01:35:49,711
He was supposed
to visit this morning...

1491
01:35:49,883 --> 01:35:51,976
...and they said he couldn't come.

1492
01:35:52,185 --> 01:35:54,244
Has anything happened to him?

1493
01:35:54,421 --> 01:35:56,753
No. Nothing.

1494
01:35:57,223 --> 01:35:58,622
I don't want to interfere...

1495
01:35:58,792 --> 01:36:01,454
...but do you think you could
tell us what you're up to?

1496
01:36:01,628 --> 01:36:05,587
Mrs. Wendice, what I'm about
to tell you may come as a shock.

1497
01:36:06,066 --> 01:36:07,363
Yes?

1498
01:36:07,534 --> 01:36:11,868
We strongly suspect that your husband
had planned to murder you.

1499
01:36:12,405 --> 01:36:16,205
Tony arranged for Swan to come here
that night and kill you.

1500
01:36:17,644 --> 01:36:19,612
How long have you known this?

1501
01:36:19,779 --> 01:36:23,374
- Did you suspect it yourself?
- No, never.

1502
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:25,609
And yet...

1503
01:36:27,721 --> 01:36:30,713
What's the matter with me, Mark?

1504
01:36:31,424 --> 01:36:34,518
I don't seem able to feel anything.

1505
01:36:35,295 --> 01:36:38,287
Shouldn't I break down or something?

1506
01:36:38,465 --> 01:36:40,660
It's delayed action, that's all.

1507
01:36:40,834 --> 01:36:44,702
In a couple of days, you're gonna
have the most wonderful breakdown.

1508
01:36:44,871 --> 01:36:46,202
When did you find out, sir?

1509
01:36:46,372 --> 01:36:50,103
Well, the first clue
came quite by accident.

1510
01:36:50,276 --> 01:36:52,676
We discovered that your husband
had been spending...

1511
01:36:52,846 --> 01:36:55,508
...a large number of pound notes
all over the place.

1512
01:36:55,682 --> 01:36:57,309
It ran into over £300.

1513
01:36:57,484 --> 01:37:00,715
And it appeared to have started
at about the time you were arrested.

1514
01:37:00,887 --> 01:37:05,017
Now, I had to find out where
he got that money and how.

1515
01:37:05,191 --> 01:37:09,321
Then I remembered that after you
were arrested we searched this flat.

1516
01:37:09,496 --> 01:37:12,727
And I saw a copy of
his bank statement in that desk.

1517
01:37:12,899 --> 01:37:16,630
So yesterday afternoon, I went to the prison
and asked to see your handbag.

1518
01:37:16,803 --> 01:37:21,297
While I was doing this,
I managed to lift your latchkey.

1519
01:37:21,474 --> 01:37:24,534
Highly irregular, of course,
but my blood was up.

1520
01:37:24,711 --> 01:37:27,145
And then this morning,
when your husband was out...

1521
01:37:27,313 --> 01:37:29,838
...I came back here
to look at his statement.

1522
01:37:30,016 --> 01:37:32,507
I never saw it because I never
got through that door.

1523
01:37:32,685 --> 01:37:36,917
You see, the key that I'd
taken from your handbag...

1524
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:40,082
...didn't fit the lock.

1525
01:37:45,999 --> 01:37:47,330
Williams?

1526
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,990
Wendice.

1527
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,733
That was a near one.

1528
01:38:41,187 --> 01:38:43,155
<i>Maida Vale Police.</i>
<i>O'Brien speaking.</i>

1529
01:38:43,323 --> 01:38:46,224
Hubbard. Look, O'Brien,
he's found out about his raincoat.

1530
01:38:46,392 --> 01:38:48,121
He just came back
and couldn't get in.

1531
01:38:48,294 --> 01:38:50,387
I think he's on his way
to the station now.

1532
01:38:50,563 --> 01:38:52,224
Has Pearson arrived
with the handbag?

1533
01:38:52,398 --> 01:38:54,229
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- Good. Now, listen.

1534
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,766
Give Wendice those books
and the handbag...

1535
01:38:56,936 --> 01:38:58,961
...and make sure he sees the key.

1536
01:38:59,505 --> 01:39:02,338
Better make him check the contents
and sign for them.

1537
01:39:02,508 --> 01:39:04,738
If he wants his own key and raincoat...

1538
01:39:04,911 --> 01:39:07,607
...tell him I've gone to Glasgow.
- <i>Right, sir.</i>

1539
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:09,179
- Any questions?
- <i>No questions.</i>

1540
01:39:09,349 --> 01:39:11,180
Call me back
when he leaves the station.

1541
01:39:11,351 --> 01:39:13,342
<i>Right, sir.</i>

1542
01:39:15,321 --> 01:39:17,721
Well, Mr. Halliday,
have you got it?

1543
01:39:17,891 --> 01:39:21,759
I don't think so.
Where's Mrs. Wendice's key?

1544
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:29,998
It took me just half an hour
to find it.

1545
01:39:34,107 --> 01:39:37,235
But if it was there,
why didn't Wendice use it just now?

1546
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:39,970
He didn't use it because he
doesn't realize it's there.

1547
01:39:40,146 --> 01:39:41,943
He still thinks it's in the handbag.

1548
01:39:42,115 --> 01:39:43,878
You see, you were
very nearly right.

1549
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:48,487
He told Swan that he would leave
your latchkey under the stair carpet.

1550
01:39:48,655 --> 01:39:52,557
And told him to return it to
the same place when he left.

1551
01:39:52,725 --> 01:39:55,421
But as Swan was killed,
we assumed that your key...

1552
01:39:55,595 --> 01:39:57,995
...would still be
in one of Swan's pockets.

1553
01:39:58,164 --> 01:40:00,928
That was his little mistake
because Swan had done...

1554
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:03,364
...exactly as you suggested,
Mr. Halliday.

1555
01:40:03,536 --> 01:40:05,902
He unlocked the door...

1556
01:40:06,072 --> 01:40:09,769
...then returned
the key before he came in.

1557
01:40:09,943 --> 01:40:11,706
And it's been
out there ever since.

1558
01:40:12,078 --> 01:40:15,013
And the key Wendice
took out of Swan's pocket...

1559
01:40:15,181 --> 01:40:19,311
...and returned to her handbag was...
- Swan's own latchkey.

1560
01:40:22,021 --> 01:40:25,354
Mind you, even I didn't
guess that at once. Extraordinary.

1561
01:40:25,525 --> 01:40:29,393
You know, it had always puzzled me
that no key was found on Swan's body.

1562
01:40:29,562 --> 01:40:32,463
After all, most men carry
a latchkey about with them.

1563
01:40:32,632 --> 01:40:34,930
And then I had a brain wave.

1564
01:40:35,101 --> 01:40:37,695
I took the key
that was in your handbag...

1565
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:42,136
...to his girlfriend's, Mrs. Van Dorn's,
and unlocked the door of her flat.

1566
01:40:42,408 --> 01:40:46,401
And then I borrowed her telephone
and called Scotland Yard.

1567
01:40:46,579 --> 01:40:49,946
- Why did you bring me here?
- You were the only other person...

1568
01:40:50,116 --> 01:40:52,380
...who could possibly
have left that key outside.

1569
01:40:52,552 --> 01:40:55,180
I had to find out
if you knew it was there.

1570
01:40:56,622 --> 01:40:58,351
Suppose I had known?

1571
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:02,192
You didn't.

1572
01:41:05,965 --> 01:41:08,058
- Mark.
- Yes, darling?

1573
01:41:08,234 --> 01:41:12,068
I think I'm going
to have that breakdown.

1574
01:41:16,542 --> 01:41:17,941
- <i>Inspector Hubbard</i>?
- O'Brien?

1575
01:41:18,111 --> 01:41:20,011
<i>Yes. He's just left the station.</i>

1576
01:41:20,179 --> 01:41:21,908
Right.

1577
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:30,084
Try and hang on just a little longer.

1578
01:41:32,558 --> 01:41:35,049
Williams, he's just left the station!

1579
01:41:35,228 --> 01:41:38,527
- Give me a thump if he comes this way.
- Do you have a handkerchief?

1580
01:41:38,698 --> 01:41:40,461
What happens now?

1581
01:41:40,633 --> 01:41:42,396
Sooner or later, he'll come back here.

1582
01:41:42,568 --> 01:41:45,765
As I've pinched his latchkey,
he'll try the one in the handbag.

1583
01:41:45,938 --> 01:41:48,372
When that doesn't fit,
he'll realize his mistake.

1584
01:41:48,541 --> 01:41:51,203
Put two and two together
and look under the stair carpet.

1585
01:41:51,377 --> 01:41:53,607
But if he doesn't do that,
all this is guesswork.

1586
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:56,146
- We can't prove a thing.
- That's perfectly true.

1587
01:41:56,315 --> 01:41:59,546
But once he opens that door,
we shall know everything.

1588
01:41:59,719 --> 01:42:02,313
- What will you do then?
- I'm to phone the home secretary.

1589
01:42:02,488 --> 01:42:05,616
- He's standing by for a call now.
- And Mrs. Wendice?

1590
01:42:05,792 --> 01:42:08,420
Will have nothing else to fear.

1591
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:14,088
- All right, Margot?
- Yes, I'm all right.

1592
01:42:14,267 --> 01:42:16,167
Quiet, now, you two.

1593
01:42:51,737 --> 01:42:53,637
- What's he doing?
- He's wondering why...

1594
01:42:53,806 --> 01:42:55,569
...that key doesn't fit.

1595
01:42:55,741 --> 01:42:58,471
He's going around to the back entrance.
He's stopped again.

1596
01:42:58,644 --> 01:43:00,236
He's looking at the handbag now.

1597
01:43:00,913 --> 01:43:05,373
He's trying to remember when
he put the key back in there.

1598
01:43:07,887 --> 01:43:09,411
Now he's given up.

1599
01:43:09,589 --> 01:43:13,025
I'm afraid we've had it this time.
He's going way down the street.

1600
01:43:13,192 --> 01:43:16,161
Hold it. He's stopped again.

1601
01:43:16,329 --> 01:43:18,320
He's turning round.

1602
01:43:18,898 --> 01:43:20,593
He's staring at the key.

1603
01:43:22,702 --> 01:43:25,398
Of course, that's Swan's key, isn't it?

1604
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:29,231
Now he's got it!
He's coming back fast.

1605
01:43:31,444 --> 01:43:32,877
He's remembered.

1606
01:44:27,266 --> 01:44:31,635
Well, as you said, Mark,
it might work out on paper, but...

1607
01:44:31,804 --> 01:44:33,965
Congratulations, inspector.

1608
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:36,608
By the way...

1609
01:44:44,183 --> 01:44:46,378
How about you, Margot?

1610
01:44:47,286 --> 01:44:49,254
Yes, I could do with something.

1611
01:44:49,422 --> 01:44:51,447
- Mark?
- So could I.

1612
01:44:51,657 --> 01:44:54,751
I suppose you're still on duty, inspector.
