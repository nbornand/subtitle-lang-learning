2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,300
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,700
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,600
"l'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

5
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,100
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,400
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like ?

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,600
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,000
- Quack, quack, quack.
- Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again.

11
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,400
Since I'm never gonna
do it again, you're never
gonna have to hear me quack.

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,100
- After tonight ?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

13
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,800
- Can I get anyone more coffee ?
- Oh, yes !

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,100
I mean, the way it is now,

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,800
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,900
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,800
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,900
They're insured. Why should
they give a fuck ? I don't even
need a gun in a Federal bank.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,400
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,300
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

22
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,800
"We got this guy's little girl.
If you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill her."

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,500
- Did it work ?
- Fuckin' right it worked.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,200
Knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone. Not a pistol,
not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,700
- Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
- Did they hurt the little girl ?

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,300
There probably never was
a little girl. The point of
the story isn't a little girl.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,200
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,200
- You want to rob banks ?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,600
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,600
-No more liquor stores ?
-What've we been talkin' about ?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,500
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be. There's too many
foreigners own liquor stores.

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,500
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,800
You tell 'em empty out
the register, they don't know
what you're talkin' about.

34
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,700
They make it too personal.

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,800
- We keep on, one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him.
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.

36
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,900
I don't want to either.
But they'll probably put us
in a situation where it's us or them.

37
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,000
And if it's not the gooks,

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,500
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,900
You got Grandpa lrving sitting
behind the counter with
a fucking Magnum in his hand.

40
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,800
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

41
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,700
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,600
- We're out of it.
- Well, what then, day jobs ?

43
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,600
- Not in this life.
- What then ?

44
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,800
Garçon, coffee !

45
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,100
This place.

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,400
Garçon means boy.

47
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,100
This place ?
A coffee shop ?

48
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,000
What's wrong with that ?

49
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,600
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not ?

50
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,900
Bars, liquor stores,

51
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,500
gas stations; you get your head
blown off stickin' up one of them.

52
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,100
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,700
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,100
- I bet you could cut down on the
hero factor in a place like this.
- Correct.

55
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,300
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,600
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.

57
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,400
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

58
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,300
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it.
No way they're takin' a bullet
for the register.

59
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,200
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour...

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,700
really give a fuck
you're stealin' from the owner ?

61
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Customers sittin' there
with food in their mouths,
they don't know what's goin' on.

62
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,200
One minute, they're havin'
a Denver omelet, the next, someone
is stickin' a gun in their face.

63
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,200
See, I got the idea the last
liquor store we stuck up, remember ?

64
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,800
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

65
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,600
You got the idea
of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

66
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,900
- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,200
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,800
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh ?

69
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Pretty smart.

70
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,200
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

71
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,500
- Come on.
- All right. Same as
last time, remember ?

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,300
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.

73
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,300
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

74
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,800
Everybody be cool !
This is a robbery !

75
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,600
Any of you fucking pricks move,

76
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,700
and I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.

77
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,500
-  Jungle boogie
-  Get down with the boogie

78
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,700
-  Jungle boogie
-  Get it on

79
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,900
-  Jungle boogie
-  Get down with the boogie

80
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,100
-  Jungle boogie
-  Get it on

81
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,300
-  Jungle boogie
-  Get up with the boogie

82
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,300
-  Jungle boogie
-  Get up with the get down

83
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,600
-  Jungle boogie
-  Get down and boogie

84
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,700
-  Jungle boogie
-  Shake it around

85
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,100
- Okay, so tell me again
about the hash bars.
- Okay, what you want to know ?

86
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,900
- Hash is legal there, right ?
- It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,400
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.

88
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,700
I mean, they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.

89
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,300
- Those are hash bars ?
- Yeah. It breaks down like this.

90
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,600
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

91
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,800
And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

92
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,100
It's illegal to carry it,
but-but that doesn't matter,
'cause get a load of this.

93
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,400
If you get stopped by a cop
in Amsterdam, it's illegal
for them to search you.

94
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,300
- I mean, that's a right the cops
in Amsterdam don't have.
- Oh, man ! I'm goin'.

95
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,700
That's all there is to it.
I'm fuckin' goin'.

96
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,600
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.

97
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,300
- But you know what the funniest thing
about Europe is ?
- What ?

98
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,200
It's the little differences.
I mean, they got the same shit
over there that they got here,

99
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,600
- but it's just there,
it's a little different.
- Example.

100
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,700
You can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

101
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,300
And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

102
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,000
And in Paris, you can buy
a beer in McDonald's.
You know what they call...

103
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,400
a Quarter-Pounder
with Cheese in Paris ?

104
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,600
They don't call it
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese ?

105
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,400
They got the metric system.
They wouldn't know what the fuck
a Quarter-Pounder is.

106
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,200
- What do they call it ?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.

107
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,600
- Royale with Cheese.
- That's right.

108
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,600
What do they call a Big Mac ?

109
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,800
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it Le Big Mac.

110
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,900
Le Big Mac.

111
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,900
- What do they call a Whopper ?
- I don't know. I didn't
go into Burger King.

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,300
- You know what they put on French fries
in Holland instead of ketchup ?
- What ?

113
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,200
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn !

114
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,300
- I seen 'em do it, man.
They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.
- Yuck.

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,100
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

116
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,700
- How many up there ?
- Three or four.

117
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,200
- That's countin' our guy ?
- Not sure.

118
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,500
- So that means that it could be
up to five guys up there ?
- It's possible.

119
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,800
We should have
fuckin' shotguns.

120
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,500
- What's her name ?
- Mia.

121
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,500
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet ?
- I don't know.

122
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,100
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.

123
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,500
Oh, really ?
She do anything I'd have seen ?

124
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,900
- I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.
- Pilot ? What's a pilot ?

125
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,300
- Well, you know the shows on TV ?
- I don't watch TV.

126
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,900
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television,

127
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,900
- and on this invention
they show shows, right ?
- Yeah.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That show's called a pilot.

129
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,100
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

130
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,000
and on the strength of that
one show, they decide if
they wanna make more shows.

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,400
Some get chosen and
become television programs.
Some don't, become nothin'.

132
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,500
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

133
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,200
You remember
Antwan Rockamora ?

134
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,000
Half-black, half-Samoan.
Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."

135
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,300
- Yeah, maybe. Fat, right ?
- I wouldn't go so far as to
call the brother fat.

136
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,100
I mean, he got a weight problem.
What's a nigger gonna do ? He's Samoan.

137
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,200
- I think I know who you mean.
What about him ?
- Marsellus fucked him up good.

138
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Word 'round the campfire is
it was on account of
Marsellus Wallace's wife.

139
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,200
- So what he'd do ? Fuck her ?
- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

140
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,800
- Well, then what then ?
- He gave her a foot massage.

141
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,100
A foot massage ?

142
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
- That's it ?
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,100
Then what'd Marsellus do ?

144
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.

145
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,100
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.

146
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,000
He had a little garden down
at the bottom enclosed in glass,
like a greenhouse.

147
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,300
Nigger fell through that.

148
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,100
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

149
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,200
- That's a damn shame.
- Hmm.

150
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,300
- But still, you play
with matches, you get burned.
- What do you mean ?

151
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,400
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's
new bride a foot massage.

152
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,800
You don't think he overreacted ?

153
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,600
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus
to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.

154
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,600
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothin'.
I give my mother a foot massage.

155
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,100
It's laying your hands in a familiar way
on Marsellus's new wife.

156
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,900
I mean, is it as bad as eatin'
her pussy out ? No, but it's
the same fuckin' ballpark.

157
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Whoa, stop right there.
Eatin' the bitch out...

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,500
and givin' the bitch a foot massage
ain't even the same fucking thing.

159
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,300
- It's not. It's the same ballpark.
- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

160
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,200
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

161
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,900
But touchin' his wife's feet
and sticking your tongue
in the holiest of holies...

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark;
it ain't the same league;
it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

163
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,800
- Foot massages don't mean shit !
- Have you ever given a foot massage ?

164
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,900
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.

165
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,500
- I'm the foot fuckin' master.
- You given a lot of them ?

166
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Shit, yeah !
Got my technique down and everything.
I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

167
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,200
Would you give a guy
a foot massage ?

168
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,200
Fuck you.

169
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,200
- You give 'em a lot ?
- Fuck you.

170
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,400
- You know, I'm kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage.
- Yo, yo, yo, man.

171
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,600
You best back off.
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

172
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,000
- This is the door.
- Yeah, it is.

173
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,200
What time you got ?

174
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,300
7:22 in the a.m.

175
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,800
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

176
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,700
Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man
a foot massage don't make it right...

177
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,800
for Marsellus to throw
Antwan off a building into
a glass motherfuckin' house,

178
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,500
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;
that shit ain't right.

179
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Motherfucker do that shit to me,
he better paralyze my ass,
'cause I kill the motherfucker.

180
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,500
I ain't sayin' it's right,
but you sayin' a massage don't mean
nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

181
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,000
Now, look, I've given a million
ladies a million foot massages,
and they all meant somethin'.

182
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,700
We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's
so fuckin' cool about them.

183
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...

184
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,900
where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.

185
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,800
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

186
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,900
That's his fuckin' wife, man.
This ain't a man with a sense
of humor about this shit.

187
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,900
You know what I'm sayin' ?

188
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,800
It's an interestin' point.

189
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,700
Come on.
Let's get into character.

190
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,300
- What's her name again ?
- Mia.

191
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,300
- Mia.
- Why you so interested
in big man's wife ?

192
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,300
He's goin' out of town, Florida.
And he asked me if I'd take care
of her while he's gone.

193
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,200
- Take care of her ?
- No, man. Just take her out.

194
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,500
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

195
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,000
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date ?

196
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,600
It is not a date.

197
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,600
It's just like if you were
gonna take your buddy's wife
to a movie or somethin'.

198
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,100
It's just good company, that's all.

199
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,500
It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.

200
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,300
Hey, kids.
How you boys doin' ?

201
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,900
Hey, keep chillin'.

202
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,500
You know who we are ?

203
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,400
We're associates of your
business partner, Marsellus Wallace.

204
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,300
You do remember
your business partner, don't you ?

205
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,800
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.

206
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,600
- You're Brett, right ?
- Yeah.

207
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,700
I thought so. You remember
your business partner Marsellus Wallace,

208
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,700
don't ya, Brett ?

209
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,300
Yeah, I remember.

210
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

211
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,100
Sorry about that.
Whatcha havin' ?

212
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,100
Hamburgers.

213
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,100
Hamburgers ! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

214
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,600
What kind of hamburgers ?

215
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,300
- Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.
- No, no, no.

216
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Where'd you get 'em ?
McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box ?

217
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,100
- Where ?
- Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.

218
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Big Kahuna Burger !
That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

219
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,000
I hear they got some tasty burgers.
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they ?

220
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,700
They're-- They're good.

221
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,300
You mind if I try
one of yours ?

222
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,700
- This is yours here, right ?
- Yeah.

223
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,400
Mmmm.

224
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,500
This is a tasty burger !
Vincent !

225
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,900
You ever had
a Big Kahuna burger ?

226
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,300
Want a bite ?
They're real tasty.

227
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,700
- I ain't hungry.
- Well, if you like burgers,
give 'em a try sometime.

228
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,500
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

229
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.

230
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,600
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmmm.

231
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,000
You know what they call
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese
in France ?

232
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
- No.
- Tell 'em, Vincent.

233
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,000
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.

234
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,400
You know why they call it that ?

235
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,400
Uh, because of
the metric system ?

236
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,600
Check out the big brain
on Brett !

237
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,900
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

238
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,200
- What's in this ?
- Sprite.

239
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,100
Sprite. Good.

240
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,900
You mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with ?

241
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,700
Go right ahead.

242
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,400
That hit the spot.

243
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,300
You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here ?

244
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,800
- Why don't you tell my man
Vince here where you got the shit hid.
- It's over--

245
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,300
I don't remember askin' you
a goddamned thing !

246
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,600
You were sayin' ?

247
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,600
It's in the cupboard.

248
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,200
N-No, the one
by your kn-knees.

249
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,400
We happy ?

250
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,200
Vincent ?

251
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,900
- We happy ?
- Yeah, we happy.

252
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Look, I'm sorry, uh, l--
I didn't get your name.

253
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,100
I got yours. Vincent. Right ?
B-But I never got yours.

254
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,300
- My name's Pitt, and your ass
ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.
- No, no, no.

255
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,500
I just want you
to know how--

256
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,400
I just want you to know how sorry we are
th-that things got so fucked up...

257
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,600
with us and Mr. Wallace.

258
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,000
W-We got into this thing with
the best intentions. Really. I never--

259
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,300
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I break your concentration ?

260
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,900
I didn't mean to do that. Please.

261
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Continue. You were saying something
about "best intentions."

262
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,000
What's the matter ?
Oh, you were finished !

263
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,700
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

264
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,900
What does Marsellus Wallace
look like ?

265
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,100
What ?

266
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,300
- What country you from ?
- What ?

267
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,400
- "What" ain't no country I ever
heard of. They speak English in What ?
- W-What ?

268
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,100
- English, motherfucker !
Do you speak it ?
- Yes !

269
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,800
- Then you know what I'm sayin' !
- Yes.

270
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,200
Describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like !

271
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,800
- What ? l--
- Say "what" again !

272
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,600
Say "what" again ! I dare ya !
I double dare you, motherfucker !

273
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,400
- Say "what" one more goddamn time !
- H-H-He's black.

274
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,700
- Go on !
- He's bald !

275
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,400
- Does he look like a bitch ?
- What ?

276
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,900
Does he look... Iike a bitch ?

277
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,100
- No !
- Then why you tryin'
to fuck him like a bitch ?

278
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,700
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett !

279
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,800
- You tried to fuck him.
- No, no.

280
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,900
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

281
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,900
- You read the Bible, Brett ?
- Yes !

282
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,400
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized. Sort of
fits this occasion.

283
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,700
Ezekiel 25:17.

284
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,900
"The path of the righteous man...

285
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,800
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish...

286
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,600
and the tyranny of evil men.

287
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,400
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and goodwill,

288
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,500
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

289
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,200
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

290
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,600
and the finder
of lost children.

291
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,400
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...

292
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,300
and furious anger...

293
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,900
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers !

294
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,600
And you will know
My name is the Lord...

295
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,900
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee !"

296
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,000
I think you gonna find...

297
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,600
when all this shit
is over and done--

298
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,200
I think you're gonna find yourself
one smilin' motherfucker.

299
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,600
The thing is, Butch,

300
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,500
right now...
you got ability.

301
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,500
But painful as it may be,

302
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,600
ability... don't last.

303
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,400
And your days are just about over.

304
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life.

305
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,600
But that's a fact of life your ass
is gonna have to get realistic about.

306
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,700
You see, this business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

307
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,500
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

308
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,800
If you mean it turns
to vinegar... it does.

309
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,900
If you mean it gets better
with age... it don't.

310
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,500
Besides, Butch,

311
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,700
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway ?

312
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,800
Hmm ?

313
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,800
Two ?

314
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,100
Boxers don't have
an old-timers' day.

315
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,000
You came close,
but you never made it.

316
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,100
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.

317
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,300
You my nigger ?

318
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,100
Certainly appears so.

319
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,100
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

320
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,300
That's pride fuckin' with you.

321
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,800
Fuck pride !

322
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,400
Pride only hurts.

323
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,300
It never helps.

324
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,600
You fight through that shit.

325
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,800
'Cause a year from now,
when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,

326
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,600
you gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

327
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,500
I got no problem
with that, Mr. Wallace.

328
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,300
In the fifth,
your ass goes down.

329
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,000
Say it.

330
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,500
In the fifth,
my ass goes down.

331
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,800
Yo, Vincent Vega.
Our man in Amsterdam.

332
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Jules Winfield, our man in lnglewood.
Get your asses on in here.

333
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,900
- Goddamn, nigger,
what's up with them clothes ?
- You don't even want to know.

334
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,100
Where's the big man ?

335
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,000
The big man's right over there
takin' care of some business.

336
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,300
Why don't you hang back a second or two.
You see the white boy leave, go on over.

337
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,100
How ya been ?

338
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,900
- I been doin' pretty good.
How 'bout yourself ?
- All right.

339
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,200
So I hear you're
takin' Mia out tomorrow.

340
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,300
At Marsellus's request.

341
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,000
- Have you met Mia ?
- Not yet.

342
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,200
What's so fuckin' funny ?

343
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,700
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I got to piss.

344
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot,
all right ? It's the big man's wife.

345
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,500
I'm gonna sit across from her,
chew my food with my mouth closed,

346
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,500
Iaugh at her fuckin' jokes,
and that's it.

347
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,500
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

348
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,500
Then what'd you fuckin'
ask me about it for ?

349
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
Asshole.

350
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,100
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
- Filters ?

351
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,000
No.

352
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,500
- You lookin' at somethin', friend ?
- You ain't my friend, palooka.

353
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,900
-What was that ?
-I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

354
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,400
Vincent Vega's in the house ?

355
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,600
My nigger,
get your ass over here.

356
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,600
- What's up ?
- Man, I'm really sorry.

357
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
You shouldn't worry about it.

358
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,700
Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.

359
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,300
And some matches.

360
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,100
Thanks.

361
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,900
It's as if it turns every part
of your body into the tip of a penis.

362
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,900
- Whoa.
- I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.

363
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That gun to pierce your ears,
they don't use that to pierce
your nipples, do they ?

364
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,000
Forget that gun. That guns goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

365
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,700
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of 'em done with a needle.

366
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,100
Five in each ear, one through
the nipple of my left breast,

367
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,200
two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow,

368
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,000
one in my belly,
one in my lip, one in my clit,

369
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,400
- and I wear a stud in my tongue.
- Excuse me.

370
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,300
I was just curious,

371
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,100
but, um... why would you wear
a stud in your tongue ?

372
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,500
Sex thing.
Helps fellatio.

373
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,400
Vincenzo.
Step in my office.

374
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,800
This is Panda from Mexico.
Very good stuff.

375
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,200
Now, that's Bava.
Different, but equally good.

376
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,100
And that is Choco
from the Harz Mountains of Germany.

377
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,400
Now, the first two are the same.
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

378
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,300
But this one
is a little more expensive.

379
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,700
This is 500 a gram.

380
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,000
But, when you shoot it, you will know
where that extra money went.

381
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,000
There's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.

382
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,600
But this one
is a fuckin' madman.

383
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,300
Remember, I just got back
from Amsterdam.

384
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,300
Am I a nigger ?
Are we in lnglewood ? No.

385
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,400
You're in my home. Now, white people
who know the difference...

386
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,300
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

387
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,600
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...

388
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,800
- any old day of the fuckin' week.
- That's a bold statement.

389
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,600
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
This is a seller's market.

390
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,500
Coke is fuckin' dead
as... dead.

391
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,300
Heroin, it's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way.

392
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,800
- All right.
Gimme three grams of madman.
- Okay.

393
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,200
Now, if it's as good as you say it is,
I'll come back and buy another thousand.

394
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,900
I just hope that I still
have some left for ya,

395
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
but I'm givin' you some
out of my own private stash.

396
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,100
That is what a nice guy I am.

397
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,100
- I'm outta balloons.
Is a baggie all right ?
- Yeah, that's cool.

398
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,100
All right.
I'll just get one for ya.

399
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,900
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and, uh, twistix from the kitchen ?

400
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,900
Okay.

401
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,300
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi ?
She ain't got a boyfriend.

402
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,500
- You wanna hang out and get high ?
- Which one's Trudi ?

403
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,600
-The one with all the shit in her face ?
-No, that's Jody.

404
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,000
That's my wife.

405
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,500
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

406
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,300
- No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.
- All right, no problemo.

407
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,000
I'll take a rain check.

408
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,200
- Oh.
- Thank you, Jody.

409
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,500
Still got your Malibu ?

410
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,500
Oh, man, you know what some fucker
did the other day ?

411
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,400
- What ?
- Fuckin' keyed it.

412
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,900
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
- Tell me about it.

413
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,600
I had it in storage
for three years.

414
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,700
It was out five days, and some
dickless piece of shit fucked with it.

415
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,900
They should be fuckin' killed,
man. No trial, no jury,
straight to execution.

416
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,700
I wish I could've caught him
doin' it. I'd have given
anything to catch that asshole.

417
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,300
- It'd been worth him doin' it
just so I could've caught him.
- What a fucker !

418
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,100
What's more chicken-shit
than fuckin' with a man's automobile ?

419
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,900
- Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
- You don't do it.

420
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,300
- It's just against the rules.
- Thank you.

421
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,500
Thank you.

422
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,200
- Mind if I shoot up here ?
- Hey, mi casa es su casa.

423
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,400
Muchas gracias.

424
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,100
Hi, Vincent.
I'm getting dressed. The door's open.

425
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Come inside and make yourself
a drink. Mia.

426
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,600
Hello ?

427
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,000
Billy Raye was a preacher's son
and when his daddy would visit
he'd come along

428
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
Vincent.

429
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,500
Vincent.

430
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,400
I'm on the intercom.

431
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,000
Where is--
Where is the intercom ?

432
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,300
It's on the wall
by the two African fellows.

433
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,400
To your right.

434
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Warm.

435
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,500
Warmer.

436
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,400
Disco.

437
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,000
Hello ?

438
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,300
Push the button
if you want to talk.

439
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,300
Hello ?

440
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,100
Go make yourself a drink, and I'll
be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

441
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,400
The bar's by the fireplace.

442
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
Okay.

443
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,600
When he started
sweet talkin' to me

444
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,300
He come and tell me
everything is all right

445
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,900
He'd kiss me and tell me
everything is all right

446
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,800
Can I get away
again tonight

447
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,400
The only one who could
ever reach me

448
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,000
Was the son
of a preacher man

449
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
The only boy
who could ever teach me

450
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,900
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was

451
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,200
He was

452
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,800
-  Lord he knows he was
-  Yes he was

453
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,600
How will I remember

454
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,300
The look was in his eyes

455
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,800
Stealing kisses from me
on the sly

456
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,300
Taking time to make time

457
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,800
Telling me that
he's all mine

458
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,700
Learning from each other's knowin'

459
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
Looking to see
how much we've grown

460
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,200
And the only one
who could ever reach me

461
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,400
Was the son
of a preacher man

462
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,300
The only boy
who could ever teach me

463
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,700
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was

464
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,400
-  Was, was
-  He was

465
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,100
Oh, yes he was

466
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,900
Let's go.

467
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,200
What the fuck is this place ?

468
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,600
This is Jackrabbit Slim's.

469
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,900
An Elvis man should love it.

470
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
- Come on, Mia. Let's go get a steak.
- You can get a steak here, daddy-o.

471
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,800
Don't be a--

472
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,100
Oh, after you, kitty-cat.

473
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,400
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, how may I help you ?

474
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,200
- There's a reservation under Wallace.
- Wallace ?

475
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,100
We reserved a car.

476
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:41,400
Oh, a car. Why don't you seat 'em
over there in the Chrysler.

Waiting on the bell to ring

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,100
Throw my books on the table
Pick up the telephone

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
-  Come on, baby

486
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,500
- Just a minute.
-  Heading down to the drugstore
to get a soda pop

487
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,800
Throw a nickel in the jukebox
Then we start to rock

488
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,900
School's out, baby
Gonna tell you some news

Let's hear it for Ricky Nelson !

496
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,700
- Fantastic job, Rick.
Thank you very much.
- Vincent !

497
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,700
Just to let you all know, Ricky will

498
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:01,100
so we hope you enjoy your meals
here at Jackrabbit Slim's.

499
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,400
Thank you.

500
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,800
Call for...

501
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,300
- Phil-lip Mor-ris.
- What do you think ?

502
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,900
I think it's like
a wax museum with a pulse.

503
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,600
Hi, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you ?

504
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh,
yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

505
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,000
- I'll have that.
- How do you want that cooked ?

506
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,200
- Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell ?
- Bloody as hell, and--

507
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,900
Oh, yeah, look at this--
vanilla Coke.

508
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,800
What about you, Peggy Sue ?

509
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,100
I'll have the...

510
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Durward Kirby burger, bloody.

511
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,100
And... a five-dollar shake.

512
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,800
How do you want that shake,
Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy ?

513
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,900
- Martin and Lewis.
- Did you just order
a five-dollar shake ?

514
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,900
Mm-hmm.

515
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
That's a shake ?
That's milk and ice cream ?

516
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,100
- Last I heard.
- That's five dollars ? You don't
put bourbon in it or nothin' ?

517
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,600
- No.
- Just checking.

518
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,300
I'll be right back
with your drinks.

519
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,200
To Lonesome Town

520
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,100
To cry my troubles away

521
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,500
Could you, um...
roll me one of those, cowboy ?

522
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,300
You can have this one, cowgirl.

523
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,300
Thanks.

524
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,600
The streets are filled
with regret

525
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,700
Think nothin' of it.

526
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,500
Lay me down
in Lonesome Town

527
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,900
-  I can learn to forget
- So...

528
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Marsellus said
you just got back from Amsterdam.

529
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,100
- Sure did.
- How long were you there ?

530
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,600
Just over three years.

531
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,700
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

532
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,400
No kiddin' ?
I didn't know that.

533
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,200
Why would you ?

534
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,600
I heard you did a pilot.

535
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,300
- That was my 15 minutes.
- What was it ?

536
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,900
It was a show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force Five.

537
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,600
- What ?
- Fox Force Five.

538
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,800
Fox, as in were a bunch
of foxy chicks.

539
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,300
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

540
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,000
And five, as in there's
one-two-three-four-five of us.

541
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,600
There was a blond one,
Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.

542
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,700
The Japanese fox
was a kung fu master.

543
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,700
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

544
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,500
French fox's speciality was sex.

545
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,500
- What was your speciality ?
- Knives.

546
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,700
The character I played,
Raven McCoy,

547
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,500
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.

548
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,600
According to the show,
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife.

549
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,400
And she knew
a zillion old jokes.

550
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,400
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

551
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,700
And if we would have got picked up,
they would've worked in a gimmick...

552
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,400
where every show
I would've told another joke.

553
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,200
You know any of them old jokes ?

554
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,900
Well, I only got the chance to say one
'cause we only did one show.

555
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,400
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

556
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Don't be that way.
Tell me.

557
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,900
- No, you wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.
- You'd be embarr--

558
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,800
You told 50 million people,
and you can't tell me ?

559
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,500
- I promise I won't laugh.
- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

560
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,800
That's not what I meant.
You know it.

561
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,200
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you
'cause it's been built up too much.

562
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,800
What a gyp.

563
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,200
Martin and Lewis.

564
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,400
Vanilla Coke.

565
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,800
Mmm. Yummy.

566
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,700
You think I could
have a sip of that ?

567
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,200
Be my guest.

568
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,200
I gotta know what
a five-dollar shake tastes like.

569
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,500
- You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.
- Yeah, but maybe I do.

570
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,400
Cooties I can handle.

571
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,300
All right.

572
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,800
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milkshake !

573
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,800
-Told ya.
-I don't know if it was worth $5,
but it's pretty fuckin' good.

574
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,600
- Don't you hate that ?
- Hate what ?

575
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,000
Uncomfortable silences.

576
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,200
Why do we feel it's necessary
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable ?

577
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:16,100
I don't know.
That's a good question.

578
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,700
That's when you know
you found somebody really special.

579
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,200
When you can just shut the fuck up for
a minute and comfortably share silence.

580
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,200
Well, I don't think we're quite
there yet, but don't feel bad.
We just met each other.

581
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,700
I'll tell you what.

582
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,900
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

583
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
You sit here...
and think of something to say.

584
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,100
I'll do that.

585
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,200
Okay.

586
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,500
I said goddamn !

587
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,600
Goddamn !
Goddamn.

588
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,600
I need some hair spray.

589
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,100
Mmmm.

590
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Don't you just love it when you
come back from the bathroom to
find your food waiting for you ?

591
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,700
We're lucky
we got anything at all.

592
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,800
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

593
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,900
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

594
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,900
- Which one ? There's two Monroes.
- No, there's not.

595
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,200
That is Marilyn Monroe.

596
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,900
That is Mamie Van Doren.

597
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,700
I don't see Jayne Mansfield,
so she must have the night off.

598
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,000
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah. I got my moments.

599
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,100
- So did you think of somethin' to say ?
- Actually, I did.

600
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,700
However...

601
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,300
you seem like
a really nice person, and l--

602
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,100
- I don't want to offend you.
- Oooh.

603
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:18,100
This doesn't sound like
the usual, mindless, boring,
gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

604
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,000
This sounds like you
actually have somethin' to say.

605
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,800
Well, well, I do. I do.

606
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,800
But you have
to promise not to be offended.
- No, no.

607
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,900
You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

608
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,700
You can ask me what you're gonna
ask me, and my natural response
could be to get offended.

609
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,000
Then, through no fault of my own,
I would have broken my promise.

610
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,700
- Let's just forget it.
- That's an impossibility.

611
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,600
Trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this would be
an exercise in futility.

612
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,800
- Is that a fact ?
- And besides,

613
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,700
- isn't it more, uh, exciting
when you don't have permission ?
- All right, all right.

614
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,500
Well, here goes.

615
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,400
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan ?

616
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,800
- Who's Antwan ?
- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

617
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,000
- He fell out of a window.
- Hmm. Hmm.

618
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,500
Well, that is one way to say it.
Another way to say it would be
that he was thrown out.

619
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,600
Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.

620
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,600
Yet even another way is to say
he was thrown out of a window
by Marsellus because of you.

621
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,000
- Is that a fact ?
- No.

622
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,100
No, it's not a fact. It's just what
I heard. That's just what I heard.

623
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,000
- Who told you ?
- They.

624
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,400
"They" talk a lot, don't they ?

625
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,000
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

626
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,100
- Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did "they" say ?
- I'm-- I'm not shy.

627
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,800
- Um--
- Did it involve the "F" word ?

628
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,700
No, no, no, no, no.
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

629
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,700
- And ?
- And-- And nothin'.

630
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,500
That's it.

631
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,600
You heard Marsellus...

632
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,600
threw Tony Rocky Horror
out of a fourth-story window
for giving me a foot massage ?

633
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,800
- Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that ?

634
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,200
Well, at the time
I was told it sounded reasonable.

635
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,200
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window...

636
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,200
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable ?

637
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,600
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

638
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,200
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

639
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,700
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

640
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,400
A husband almost killing
another man for touching
his wife's feet is something else.

641
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,900
But did it happen ?

642
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,600
Only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand when he
shook it... at my wedding.

643
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,000
Really ?

644
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,200
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus
threw Tony out that window...

645
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,200
except Marsellus and Tony.

646
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,100
When you little scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.

647
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,900
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

648
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,800
The world-famous
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

649
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,100
Now, this is where
one lucky couple...

650
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,600
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

651
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,100
Now, who will be
our first contestants ?

652
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,300
- Right here !
- All right !

653
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,300
- I wanna dance.
- No, no, no, no, no.

654
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,900
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe
Marsellus, my husband, your boss,

655
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,300
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

656
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,900
Now I wanna dance;
I wanna win; I want that trophy.

657
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,400
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

658
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,300
Let's hear it
for our first contestants.

659
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:37,800
Now let's meet our first
contestants here this evening.
Young lady, what is your name ?

660
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,800
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

661
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,400
And how 'bout your fella here ?

662
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,200
Vincent Vega.

663
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,600
All right, let's see what you can do.
Take it away !

664
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,400
- Go for it.
- Come on !

665
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,800
It was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

666
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,500
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

667
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,400
And now the young monsieur
and madame have rung the chapel bell

668
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,300
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

669
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,200
They furnished off an apartment
with a two-room Roebucks sale

670
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:41,100
The 'coolerador was crammed
with TV dinners and ginger ale

671
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,700
But when Pierre found work
the little money comin'
worked out well

672
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,700
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

673
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,400
They had a hi-fi phono
and boy did they let it blast

674
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,600
Seven hundred little records
all rock, rhythm and jazz

675
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,300
But when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell

676
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:17,000
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

677
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,400
They had a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

678
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,200
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

679
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,100
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence ?

680
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,400
I don't know
what you call that.

681
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,900
Drinks ! Music !

682
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,000
I'm gonna take a piss.

683
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,900
That's a little bit more information
than I needed, but go right ahead.

684
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,300
Girl

685
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,100
Bomp, bomp, bom

686
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,500
You'll be a woman soon

687
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,900
I love you so much
Can't count all the ways

688
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,900
I'd die for you, girl
and all they can say is

689
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
He's not your kind

690
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:18,100
You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around

691
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,400
What I'm gonna find

692
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,400
Don't let them
make up your mind

693
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,300
Don't you know, girl

694
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,100
You'll be a woman soon

695
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,100
One drink, and that's it.

696
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,800
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink, but do it quickly.

697
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,700
Say good night...
and go home.

698
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
You'll be a woman soon

699
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,100
Soon

700
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,500
You'll be a woman

701
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,800
I've been misunderstood
for all of my life

702
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,100
But what they're sayin', girl
it cuts like a knife

703
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,400
The boy's no good

704
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,100
Well, I've finally have found
what I been lookin' for

705
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,100
But if they get a chance
they'll end it for sure
Sure they would

706
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,000
Baby, I've done
all I could

707
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:19,500
You see, this is
a moral test of oneself.

708
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,700
Whether or not
you can maintain loyalty.

709
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,000
Because... being loyal
is very important.

710
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,500
You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around

711
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,000
What I'm gonna find

712
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,900
Don't let them
make up your mind

713
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,700
Don't you know, girl

714
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,900
You'll be a woman soon

715
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,300
Please

716
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,400
Come take my hand

717
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,300
Girl

718
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,400
You'll be a woman soon

719
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,600
Please

720
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,700
Come take my hand

721
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,200
- Hello.
-  Girl

722
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,400
So, you're gonna go out there
and you're gonna say, "Good night.

723
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,900
I've had a very lovely evening."

724
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,900
Walk out the door, get in
the car, go home, jerk off,
and that's all you gonna do.

725
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,300
Now it's up to you, girl

726
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,800
You'll be a woman soon

727
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,200
Please

728
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,800
Come take my hand

729
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,400
Girl

730
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,000
You'll be a woman soon

731
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,500
Soon

732
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,500
You'll be a woman

733
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,900
All right, Mia.

734
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
So listen, I gotta go,
all right ?

735
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,200
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

736
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,900
You fu--
Oh, Jesus Christ !

737
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,200
Oh, fuck me.
Fuck me !

738
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,700
Oh-- Come on, girl. We're gettin'
outta here. We gotta walk now.

739
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,100
Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia !

740
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,000
Fuck !

741
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,700
Answer.

742
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,900
- Why, certainly.
- Join hands, you two lovebirds.

743
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,300
Please ! Please !

744
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,900
Yes, yes.
Hold hands, you lovebirds.

745
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,000
Fuck you, Lance !
Answer !

746
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,700
Now what do you say ?

747
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,600
I give up !
I'll marry you !

748
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:28,100
Lance !
The goddamn phone's ringing !

749
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,600
I can hear it.

750
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,900
I thought you told those
fuckin' assholes never to
call here this late !

751
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,900
Yeah, I told them.

752
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,100
And that is exactly what I'm going
to tell this fucking asshole right now.

753
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,300
Don't you dare strike me !
- Hello.

754
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,500
Lance ! Vincent.

755
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,400
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.
I'm coming to your house.

756
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,400
W-Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man.
W-What's the problem ?

757
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,600
- I got this chick,
she's fuckin' O.D.in' on me !
- Well, don't bring her here !

758
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,700
I'm not even joking with you !
Do not be bringing some
fucked-up pooh-bah to my house !

759
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,900
- No choice.
- Wh-- She's O.D.in' ?

760
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:06,000
- She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man !
- Just dandy.

761
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:10,100
Okay, then you bite
the fuckin' bullet, take her
to a hospital and call a lawyer.

762
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,500
- Negative !
- This is not my fuckin' problem, man !

763
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,200
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this !

764
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,900
Uh, are you talkin' to me
on a cellular phone ?

765
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,300
I don't know you.
Who is this ? Don't come here !

766
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,600
I'm hanging up the phone !
Prank caller ! Prank caller !

767
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,200
What the hell was that ?

768
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,400
Have you lost
your fucking mind ?

769
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,300
- You were talking about drug
shit on a cellular phone !
- Lance, help me.

770
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,200
- You crashed your car
into my fucking house !
- Grab her feet.

771
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,500
Are you deaf ? You are not bringing
this fucked-up bitch into my house !

772
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,400
This "fucked-up bitch"
is Marsellus Wallace's wife.

773
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,800
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is ?
- Yeah.

774
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,700
If she croaks on me,
I am a fucking grease spot !

775
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:01,100
I will be forced to tell him
that you did not help and
let her die on your lawn.

776
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,000
Now, come on. Help me, help me.
Pick her up.

777
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,900
Shit.

778
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,200
Lance !

779
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,100
Shit.

780
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,500
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.

781
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,800
What the fuck's going on out here ?

782
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,700
Who's she ?

783
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,600
Go to the fridge and get the thing
with the adrenalin shot.

784
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,600
- What's wrong with her ?
- She's O.D.ing !

785
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,600
- Get her outta here !
- Get the shot !

786
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,100
- Fuck you ! Fuck you too !
- What a fuckin' bitch.

787
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,000
Just keep talking to her,
all right ?

788
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,900
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going
to go get my little black medical book.

789
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,900
What the fuck you need
a medical book for ?

790
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,800
I've never had to give
an adrenalin shot before !

791
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,200
I don't go joy-poppin'
with bubble-gummers !
My friends can handle their highs !

792
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,600
- Get the shot !
- I am, if you'll let me !

793
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,400
- I ain't stopping you !
- Stop talking to me.
Start talking to her !

794
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,400
- Get the shot !
- All right !

795
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,700
- Hurry up. We're losing her !
- I'm looking as fast as I can !

796
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,600
What's he looking for ?

797
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,500
- I don't know. Some book.
- What are you looking for ?

798
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,400
- A little black medical book.
- What are you looking for ?

799
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:08,400
My little black medical book ! It's
like a textbook they give to nurses.

800
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,300
- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me. I have one.

801
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,100
- If it's so important,
why don't you keep it with the shot ?
- I don't know !

802
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,000
- Stop bothering me !
- While you're looking, that girl's
gonna die on our carpet.

803
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,900
You're never gonna find
anything in this mess !

804
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,700
- I'm gonna fucking kill you
if you don't shut up !
- Lance, get in here !

805
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,800
- Right ? Pig.
- Get the fuck outta my way.

806
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:31,200
- Quit fuckin' around
and give her the shot.
- While I'm doing this,

807
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,500
you take off her shirt
and find her heart.

808
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,900
- Does it gotta be exact ?
- We're giving her a shot in the heart,
so it's gotta be exact.

809
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,800
I don't know exactly where her heart is.
I think it's right here.

810
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,400
- That's it.
- All right, what I need is
a big, fat magic marker.

811
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,300
- You got it ?
- What ?

812
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,000
A magic marker.
A felt pen !

813
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,600
A fuckin' black magic marker !
Christ.

814
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,500
- Come on, man. Hurry up !
- Fuck ! Okay, okay.
Okay. I think it's ready.

815
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,900
- Hurry up, man.
- I'll tell you what to do.

816
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,800
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- No, you're gonna give her the shot.

817
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,700
- I ain't giving her the shot.
I never done this before.
- I never done this either !

818
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,600
I ain't starting now !
You brought her here.
You give her the shot.

819
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,000
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch
to your house, then I give her the shot.

820
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,900
Give it to me.
Give me that.

821
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,800
All right, tell me what to do.

822
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,700
Okay, you're giving her an injection
of adrenalin straight to her heart.

823
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,600
But she's got a breastplate--
You gotta pierce through that.

824
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,500
You gotta bring the needle
down in a stabbing motion.

825
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,800
- I gotta-- I gotta
stab her three times ?
- No, just stab her once !

826
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,200
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart.

827
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,100
Once you do that,
you p-press down on the p-plunger.

828
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,500
- Okay. Then what happens ?
- Kinda curious about that myself.

829
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,400
This ain't no fuckin' joke !
Am I gonna kill her ?

830
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,800
- She's supposed to come out
of it like that. It's--
- All right, count to three.

831
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,000
- All right. Ready ?
- One.

832
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,500
Two.

833
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,000
Three !

834
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,100
If you're all right,
then say something.

835
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,100
Something.

836
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,000
That was fuckin' trippy.

837
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,700
- Ohh.
- Oh, man.

838
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,200
Mia. Mia.

839
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,700
What's--

840
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,400
What's your thoughts on-- on--

841
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,400
on how to handle this ?

842
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,300
What's yours ?

843
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:15,000
Well, I'm of the opinion
that if Marsellus lived his whole life,

844
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:18,900
he doesn't need to know
nothing about this incident.

845
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,700
If Marsellus knew
about this incident,

846
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,800
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

847
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,300
I seriously doubt that.

848
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,100
I can keep a secret if you can.

849
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,000
Shake on it ?

850
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,100
Mum's the word ?

851
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,100
Cool.

852
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:46,100
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go home and have a heart attack.

853
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,800
Vincent.

854
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,500
Do you wanna hear
my Fox Force Five joke ?

855
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,400
Sure.

856
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,300
Except I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

857
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,200
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

858
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,500
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.

859
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,600
- I can't wait.
- Okay.

860
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:12,500
Three tomatoes
are walkin' down the street.

861
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,900
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato
and Baby Tomato.

862
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,900
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,
and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

863
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,800
Goes back and squishes him
and says,

864
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,900
"Ketchup."

865
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,500
Ketchup.

866
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,500
See you around.

867
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,200
Oh, that Paddlefoot.
He funny, silly dog.

868
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:01,100
He think totem pole alive !

869
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,800
He arctic tenderfoot !

870
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:07,400
That totem pole been here forever !

871
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,300
Butch ?

872
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,100
One more thing, and we'll start for--

873
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,000
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second.
- Yeah ?

874
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:18,500
- You've got a special visitor.
- Stand up. Stand up.

875
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,900
Now, do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp ?

876
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,600
Well, this here is Captain Koons.

877
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,500
He was in the P.O.W. camp
with Daddy.

878
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,400
Hello, little man.

879
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,400
Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.

880
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,600
See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.

881
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,600
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...

882
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,000
over five years.

883
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,900
Hopefully...

884
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,800
you'll never have to
experience this yourself,

885
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,200
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were...

886
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,900
for as long as we were,

887
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
you take on certain responsibilities
of the other.

888
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,000
If it'd been me who'd--

889
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,200
not made it,

890
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,200
Major Coolidge'd be talking right now
to my son Jim.

891
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,900
But the way it turned out,
I'm talking to you.

892
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,100
Butch...

893
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,400
I got something for ya.

894
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,700
This watch I got here...

895
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:39,300
was first purchased
by your great-grandfather
during the first World War.

896
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:43,900
It was bought in a little general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

897
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,400
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

898
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,300
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

899
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,400
It was bought
by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

900
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,200
on the day he set sail for Paris.

901
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,600
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch,

902
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,900
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...

903
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,400
when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother,

904
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:09,500
took the watch off,
put it in an old coffee can,
and in that can it stayed...

905
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:14,100
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...

906
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,700
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

907
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,100
This time they called it
World War ll.

908
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:26,000
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.

909
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,900
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

910
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,800
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed...

911
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:35,700
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake lsland.

912
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,600
Your granddad was facing death.

913
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,500
He knew it.

914
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,400
None of those boys ever
had any illusions about
leaving that island alive,

915
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,500
so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

916
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:52,600
your granddad asked
a gunner on an Air Force transport,
name of Winocki--

917
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:55,500
a man he'd never met before
in his life--

918
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,400
to deliver to his infant son,

919
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,900
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

920
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:06,900
Three days later, your granddad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

921
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,200
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,

922
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:15,300
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.

923
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,300
This watch.

924
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:28,100
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

925
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,500
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

926
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,500
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

927
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,900
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

928
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,500
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

929
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:46,400
He'd be damned if any slope's
gonna put their greasy, yellow
hands on his boy's birthright,

930
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,200
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something-- his ass.

931
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,600
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

932
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,600
Then he died of dysentery--
He give me the watch.

933
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,400
I hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years.

934
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,400
Then...

935
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,300
after seven years,
I was sent home to my family and...

936
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,300
now...

937
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,400
Iittle man,
I give the watch to you.

938
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,200
It's time, Butch.

939
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,400
ln the heavyweight division,

940
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,500
in the right corner
wearing the blue trunks,

941
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,700
weighing 210 pounds,

942
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,800
Floyd Ray Wilson !

943
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,600
It's official. It's official.

944
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,500
- Wilson is dead !
- Well, Dan,
that had to be the bloodiest,

945
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,900
hands down, the most brutal fight
this city's ever seen.

946
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:11,400
Coolidge was out of there
faster than I've ever seen
a victorious boxer leave the ring.

947
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,300
- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead ?
- My guess would be yes.

948
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:17,600
I could see the frenzy in his
eyes give way to the realization
of what he was doing.

949
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,000
- I think any man would've
left the ring that fast.
- Do you feel this tragedy...

950
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,900
is gonna affect
the world of boxing ?

951
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,800
A tragedy like this can't help
but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundations.

952
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,600
It's of paramount importance,
during the sad weeks ahead,
the eyes of the W.B.A. remain--

953
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,200
Man, you know I didn't--

954
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:09,100
- Marsellus.
- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.

955
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,000
I didn't do it.

956
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,500
- How you doing ?
- Great.

957
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,900
I never thanked you
for dinner.

958
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,600
- What you got ?
- He booked.

959
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:22,600
- His trainer ?
- Says he don't know nothin'.
I believe him.

960
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:26,000
- I think Butch surprised
his ass same as us.
- No, we don't wanna "think."

961
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:29,500
We wanna know. Take him to
the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.

962
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,900
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

963
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:34,800
Butch's search--
How do you want it done ?

964
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,700
I'm prepared to scour the Earth
for that motherfucker.

965
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:41,000
If Butch goes to lndochina, I want
a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...

966
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,100
ready to pop a cap in his ass.

967
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,300
I will take care of it.

968
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,900
Mister.

969
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,000
- Hey, mister.
- What ?

970
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:06,700
You were in that fight,
the fight on the radio.

971
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,100
- You're the fighter ?
- Whatever gave you that idea ?

972
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,800
No, come on.

973
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,700
You're him.

974
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,100
I know you're him.

975
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,600
Tell me you're him.

976
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,500
I'm him.

977
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,900
You killed the other boxing man.

978
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,400
He's dead ?

979
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,800
The radio said he was dead.

980
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,600
Sorry about that, Floyd.

981
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,300
What does it feel like ?

982
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,200
What does what feel like ?

983
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,100
Killing a man.

984
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,700
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

985
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,600
What are you, a weirdo ?

986
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,600
No.

987
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,900
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

988
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,200
You are the first person
I have ever met who has killed somebody.

989
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,900
So ?

990
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,100
What does it feel like to kill a man ?

991
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,000
I'll tell you what.

992
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:18,900
Give me one of them cigarettes
you got up there, and I'll
tell you all about it.

993
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:39,000
So, Esmarelda...

994
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,500
Villa Lobos--
Is that Mexican ?

995
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,700
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

996
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:49,900
- That's some handle
you got there, honey.
- Thank you.

997
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,800
And what is your name ?

998
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:55,900
Butch.

999
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,600
- What does it mean ?
- I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

1000
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,200
So, moving right along,

1001
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,100
Esmarelda,

1002
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,400
what is it you want to know ?

1003
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:12,100
- I want to know what it
feels like to kill a man.
- I couldn't tell ya.

1004
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:21,800
Didn't know he was dead
'til you told me he was dead.

1005
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:26,500
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it ?

1006
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:33,400
I don't feel
the least bit bad about it.

1007
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:46,200
What the fuck'd I tell ya ?
Huh ?

1008
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:50,100
As soon as the word got out
the fix was in, man, the odds
went through the roof.

1009
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:52,300
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1010
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:55,600
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was
a better boxer, he'd still be alive.

1011
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,500
If he never
laced up his gloves,

1012
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,900
which he never shoulda done in the first
fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1013
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:05,400
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck ?
It's over now.

1014
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,300
Yeah, well, enough about the poor,
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1015
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,900
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1016
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,800
How many bookies did you
lay it around on ?

1017
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,200
All eight ?
How long to collect ?

1018
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,500
So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night ? No, I understand.

1019
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,600
A few stragglers aside.
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.

1020
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:26,800
That is great news, man.

1021
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:30,900
Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1022
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,100
It'll probably take us
a couple days to get down to Knoxville.

1023
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,100
Okay, my brother.

1024
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,000
You're right.

1025
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,300
You're goddamn right.

1026
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,700
All right, Scotty, next time I see you,
it'll be on Tennessee time.

1027
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,000
Cool, brother.

1028
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,900
$45.60.

1029
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,200
And, uh,

1030
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,400
here's a little something
for the effort.

1031
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:15,300
Now, if anybody asks you who your fare
was tonight, what are you gonna say ?

1032
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,200
The truth.

1033
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,600
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1034
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,700
Bonsoir,
Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1035
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,200
Buenas Noches, Butch.

1036
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,700
Whew.

1037
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,000
Keep the light off.

1038
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,900
- Is that better, Sugar Pop ?
- Oui.

1039
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,000
Hard day at the office ?

1040
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:53,900
Pretty hard.

1041
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,100
Got in a fight.

1042
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,300
Poor baby.

1043
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:00,800
Can you make spoons ?

1044
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,700
You know what ?
I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1045
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:07,500
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
- I like the way you stink.

1046
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,900
Let me take this jacket off.

1047
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,400
- I was looking at myself in the mirror.
- Uh-huh.

1048
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,300
I wish I had a pot.

1049
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,800
You were looking
at yourself in the mirror,
and you wish you had some pot ?

1050
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,700
A pot.
A pot belly.

1051
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,800
Pot bellies are sexy.

1052
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,100
Well, you should be happy,

1053
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,000
'cause you have one.

1054
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:35,400
Shut up, fatso.
I don't have a pot.

1055
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:39,200
I have a bit of a tummy,
like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."

1056
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,100
It's not the same thing.

1057
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,900
I didn't know there was
such a difference between
a pot belly and a tummy.

1058
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,800
The difference is huge.

1059
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:50,200
Would you like it if I had a pot belly ?

1060
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,100
No.

1061
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:56,200
Pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1062
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,500
But on a woman
a pot belly's very sexy.

1063
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:04,800
The rest of you is normal-- normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal ass--

1064
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,700
but with a big,
perfectly round pot belly.

1065
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,600
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

1066
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:13,500
to accentuate it.

1067
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,900
You think men
would find that attractive ?

1068
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1069
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:22,400
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye...

1070
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,300
is seldom the same.

1071
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,100
If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.

1072
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,900
- You'd punch me in the belly ?
- Right in the belly.

1073
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,900
Ohh ! I'd smother you !

1074
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:39,700
I'd drop it right on your face
'til you couldn't breathe !

1075
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,600
- You'd do that ?
- Yeah.

1076
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,600
- Promise ?
- Yeah.

1077
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,800
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1078
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:53,300
Oh.

1079
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,400
Did you get everything ?

1080
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,400
- Yes, I did.
- Good job, Sugar Pop.

1081
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,300
Did everything
go as planned ?

1082
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,000
You didn't listen to the-- Ow !

1083
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,900
You didn't listen to the radio ?

1084
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,100
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner ?

1085
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,400
I won, all right.

1086
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,300
- Are you still retiring ?
- Sure am.

1087
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,600
So it all worked out
in the finish.

1088
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,300
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1089
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,700
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we ?

1090
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,000
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they ?

1091
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,800
But they won't find us,
will they ?

1092
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,400
Do you still want me
to go with you ?

1093
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:53,400
I don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance. It's--

1094
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,000
Say it.

1095
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,600
Fabienne,

1096
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:07,700
I want you to be with me.

1097
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:10,600
- Forever ?
- Forever and ever.

1098
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,600
Do you love me ?

1099
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,500
Very, very much.

1100
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,500
- Butch.
- Yes ?

1101
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,300
Will you give me
oral pleasure ?

1102
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,600
Will you kiss it ?

1103
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,600
But you first.

1104
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:38,400
- Okay.
- Okay.

1105
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,400
Butch.

1106
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,800
Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.

1107
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,100
I think I cracked a rib.

1108
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,500
- Giving me oral pleasure ?
- No, retard, from the fight.

1109
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:17,800
- Don't call me "retard."
- My name is Fabby.

1110
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,300
- My name is Fabienne !
- Stop it.

1111
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,200
- Stop it !
- My name is Fabi--

1112
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:25,100
Shut up, fuckhead !
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1113
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:28,100
Okay, okay.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1114
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,000
I take it back.

1115
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:35,700
Will you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip ?

1116
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:39,600
Oh, I like that.
I like being called a tulip.

1117
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,000
"Tulip" is much better
than "mongoloid."

1118
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,900
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.

1119
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:47,000
And I took it back.

1120
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Butch ?

1121
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,000
Yes, Lemon Pie ?

1122
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,300
- Where are we going to go ?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

1123
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,400
Wherever you want.

1124
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:59,300
We're gonna get a lot
of money from this,

1125
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,200
but it ain't gonna be
the kind of money...

1126
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:05,100
that we can live like hogs
in the fathouse forever.

1127
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:08,900
I was thinking maybe we could go
down someplace in the South Pacific.

1128
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,300
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna
carry us a long way down there.

1129
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,200
- If we wanted,
we could live in Bora Bora ?
- You betcha.

1130
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,500
And if after a while you didn't
dig that, we could go someplace else.

1131
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,400
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1132
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,400
But I do not speak Spanish.

1133
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,300
Well, you do not speak
Bora-Boran either.

1134
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,200
Besides, Mexican's easy.

1135
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,100
- ¿ Donde esta el zapateria ?
- What does that mean ?

1136
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,000
Where is the shoe store?

1137
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,900
- ¿ Donde esta--
- Spit, please.

1138
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:39,100
- ¿ Donde esta el zapateria ?
- Excellent pronunciation.

1139
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,100
Mmm.

1140
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,300
You'll be my little mamacita
in no time.

1141
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,800
¿ Que hora es ?
- ¿ Que hora es ?

1142
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,900
- What time is it ?
- What time is it ?

1143
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,500
Time for bed.

1144
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,500
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1145
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,700
Butch ?

1146
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,200
Never mind.

1147
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:19,400
Aah !

1148
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:23,400
Merde ! You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream ?

1149
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,400
- What is this you're watching ?
- A motorcycle movie.

1150
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,400
I'm not sure the name.

1151
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:44,200
- Are you watching it ?
- In a way.

1152
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,900
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.

1153
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:56,900
- What was it about ?
- How should I know ?
You were the one watching it.

1154
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,800
- No, imbecile,
what was your dream about ?
- I don't know.

1155
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,700
I don't remember.

1156
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,600
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1157
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,500
Well, let's look
at the grumpy man in the morning.

1158
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:13,300
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast.

1159
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,900
One more kiss,
and I'll get up.

1160
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:21,000
- Satisfied ?
- Yep.

1161
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,400
- Get up, lazy bones !
- Ohh !

1162
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,400
Ohh. God.

1163
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:32,000
- What time is it ?
- Almost nine in the morning.

1164
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:35,700
- What time does our train arrive ?
- Eleven.

1165
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,800
- You know what I'm gonna
have for breakfast ?
- What, Lemon Pie ?

1166
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:44,000
I'm gonna order a big plate
of blueberry pancakes...

1167
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,900
with maple syrup,

1168
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,300
eggs over easy
and five sausages.

1169
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,500
Anything to drink with that ?

1170
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:55,100
Wow, that looks nice.

1171
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,300
To drink-- A tall glass
of orange juice...

1172
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,700
and a black cup of coffee.

1173
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,200
- After that, I'm going to
have a slice of pie.
- Pie for breakfast ?

1174
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:09,000
Any time of the day
is a good time for pie.

1175
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,900
Blueberry pie
to go with the pancakes.

1176
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,800
And on top, a thin slice
of melted cheese.

1177
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,800
Where's my watch ?

1178
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,200
It's there.

1179
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,800
- No, it's not.
- Have you looked ?

1180
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,800
Yes, I've fuckin' looked.
What the fuck do you think I'm doin' ?

1181
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
You sure you got it ?

1182
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,300
Yes.
Bedside table drawer.

1183
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,400
- On the little kangaroo ?
- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1184
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:40,500
Yeah, well,
it's not here now.

1185
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,300
Well, it should be.

1186
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:47,100
Yes, it most definitely should be,
but it's not here now !
So where the fuck is it ?

1187
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,700
Fabienne,
where's my father's fucking watch ?

1188
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:01,600
Do you have any idea what he had
to go through to get me that watch ?

1189
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,400
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.

1190
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:09,600
All this other shit you could've set
on fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget the fucking watch.

1191
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,000
Now think.

1192
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,400
- Did you get it ?
- I believe so.

1193
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:17,600
"You believe so" ?
What the fuck does that mean ?
You either did or didn't get it.

1194
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,800
Then I did.

1195
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:24,000
Are you sure ?

1196
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,900
No.

1197
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,800
Fuck ! Fuck ! Fuck !

1198
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,100
Motherfucker !
Motherfuckin'--

1199
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:37,600
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are ?

1200
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,500
No !

1201
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,900
It's not your fault.

1202
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,900
You left it at the apartment.

1203
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:59,500
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1204
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:04,500
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.

1205
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,500
I reminded you about it,

1206
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:13,100
but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me.

1207
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:17,000
If all I gave a fuck about was
the watch, I shoulda told you that.

1208
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,400
You're not a mind reader.

1209
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,400
Are you ?

1210
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:32,900
I-- I'm sorry.

1211
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,500
Don't be. Just means
I can't have breakfast with you.

1212
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,100
Why does it mean that ?

1213
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,800
Because I gotta go back to my apartment
and get my watch.

1214
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:48,400
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there ?

1215
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:52,400
Well, that's what
I'm gonna find out.

1216
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,700
If they are, and I don't think
I can handle it,

1217
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,600
then I'll split.

1218
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:01,700
I saw your watch. I thought
I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1219
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:09,800
Here's some money.
Go out and get those pancakes.

1220
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,700
Have a nice breakfast.

1221
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:15,000
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back
before you can say "blueberry pie."

1222
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:17,400
Blueberry pie.

1223
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,600
Maybe not that fast.

1224
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,700
- But pretty fast. Okay ?
- Okay.

1225
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

1226
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:27,900
Shit ! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget,

1227
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,800
she forgets my father's watch !

1228
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:31,700
I specifically reminded her--

1229
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,800
bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1230
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:37,000
I said the words:
"Don't forget my father's watch."

1231
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:55,200
Visit the Jackrabbit Slim's
nearest you...

1232
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,400
Lookin' good, Butch.

1233
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,500
lf I were walkin'
in your shoes

1234
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:06,000
Countin' flowers on the wall
That don't bother me at all

1235
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,300
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of fifty-one

1236
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,200
That's how you're gonna
beat 'em, Butch.

1237
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,300
-  Smokin' cigarettes and
watchin' Captain Kangaroo
- They keep underestimatin' ya.

1238
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,300
Now don't tell me

1239
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:23,100
Countin' flowers on the wall

1240
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:26,500
That don't bother me at all

1241
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:31,800
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of fifty-one

1242
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:36,500
Smokin' cigarettes
and watchin' Captain Kangaroo

1243
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,300
Now don't tell me

1244
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,700
I've nothin' to do

1245
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,000
It's good to see you
I must go

1246
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,000
I know I look a fright

1247
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:48,500
-  Anyway my eyes
- Motherfucker.

1248
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,800
-  Are not accustomed--
- Uhh !

1249
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,000
- Do you think he's dead ?
- He's dead.

1250
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,200
- Oh, my God.
- He's dead.

1251
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:16,400
If you need someone to go
to court, I'll be glad to help.
That guy was a drunken maniac.

1252
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:19,300
He hit you, then he
crashed into that car.

1253
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,200
- Who ?
- Him.

1254
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:27,200
I'll be damned.

1255
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,900
Ohh !

1256
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,500
Aaaah ! I'm shot !

1257
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,300
Sally ! Sally !

1258
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,500
Aaah !

1259
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:09,400
- Can I help you with somethin' ?
- Shut the fuck up.

1260
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,300
Now you just wait
a goddamn minute, now !

1261
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,300
What the fuck you up to ?

1262
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,800
Come here, motherfucker !

1263
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:19,700
You feel that sting, huh, big boy ?

1264
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,600
That's pride
fuckin' with you, see ?

1265
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:25,000
You gotta fight through that shit !
Huh ?

1266
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,900
- You'd better kill me--
- Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed.

1267
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,400
Somebody's gonna get
their motherfuckin' head blown to--

1268
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,900
Hold it right there, goddamn it.

1269
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,600
- This ain't none
of your business, mister.
- I'm makin' it my business.

1270
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:39,300
- Toss the weapon.
- You don't understand, man.

1271
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,300
Toss the weapon.

1272
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:46,300
It's time

1273
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,000
-  To find love
- Take your foot off the nigger,

1274
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,900
put your hand behind your head,

1275
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
approach the counter right now.

1276
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
This motherfucker's trying to...

1277
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:56,300
kill me.

1278
01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:00,000
Shut up.
Keep comin'. Come on.

1279
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,800
lf love

1280
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,800
ls shelter

1281
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,500
Zed. Maynard.

1282
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:29,400
Yeah, the spider
just caught a couple flies.

1283
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,700
Whoa, my angel

1284
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:38,200
Down to you

1285
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:18,100
Nobody kills anybody
in my place of business...

1286
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:21,000
except me or Zed.

1287
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:25,000
That's Zed.

1288
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:40,400
- I thought you said you waited for me.
- I did.

1289
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:47,400
Then how come they're all beat up ?

1290
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:51,400
They did that to each other, man.
They came in fightin'.

1291
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:55,600
Now, this 'un right here,
he was gonna shoot that one.

1292
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:59,000
Is that right ?
You gonna shoot him, boy ?

1293
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,600
Huh ?

1294
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:06,500
Hey, is Grace
all right out front ?

1295
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,600
- Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it ?
- No, it's Thursday.

1296
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:12,200
- She oughta be fine.
- Mmm.

1297
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:17,600
Well, bring out the Gimp.

1298
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,400
I think the Gimp's sleepin'.

1299
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:25,200
Then I guess you'll just have to go
wake him up now, won't you ?

1300
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:04,600
Get up.

1301
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:19,200
Get down.

1302
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,600
Which one of 'em
you wanna do first ?

1303
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:35,300
I ain't for sure yet.

1304
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:41,200
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo,

1305
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:43,800
catch a nigger...

1306
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:46,400
by his toe.

1307
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:50,000
If he hollers, let him go.

1308
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:54,100
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.

1309
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,700
My mother said...

1310
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:03,300
pick the perfect one,

1311
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:06,200
and... you... are...

1312
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,400
it.

1313
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:14,600
- Guess that means you, big boy.
- Fuck you !

1314
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:17,100
Shh.

1315
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:23,200
- You wanna do it in here ?
- No, let's take him back
to Russell's old room.

1316
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,800
Sounds good to me.

1317
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,800
You keep an eye on this 'un.

1318
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:20,700
Yeah !

1319
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:26,500
Now ! Go ! Come on, motherfucker !

1320
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:29,800
Now, motherfucker !
Aaah !

1321
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:34,200
Come on ! Yeah !

1322
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:43,100
Yeah !

1323
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:51,600
- Ohh !
- Yeah !

1324
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:57,200
Yeah ! Yeah !

1325
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,500
Yeee !
Yeeee-hah !

1326
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,100
Yeah !

1327
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:53,200
Come on !
Get down there !

1328
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,900
Aaah !
Do it ! Yeah !

1329
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:18,200
Yeah ! Yeah !

1330
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,300
Shut the fuck up !

1331
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,900
Fuck him !

1332
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:43,800
Come on !

1333
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:50,500
Fuck him. Yeah.

1334
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:02,700
Aaaaah !

1335
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,500
Aaaaah !

1336
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,200
You want that gun,
don't ya, Zed ?

1337
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,600
Huh ?

1338
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:28,400
Go ahead and pick it up.

1339
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,000
Go ahead. Pick it up.

1340
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,600
Come on--
Thatta boy !

1341
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:43,000
I want you to pick it up, Zed.

1342
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:50,000
Step aside, Butch.

1343
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:04,700
Fuck !

1344
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:10,000
You okay ?

1345
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:13,400
No, man.

1346
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:16,300
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.

1347
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,800
What now ?

1348
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,900
"What now" ?

1349
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:38,500
Let me tell you what now.

1350
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:41,400
I'm gonna call a couple of hard,
pipe-hittin' niggers...

1351
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:44,200
to go to work
on the homes here...

1352
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:47,100
with a pair of pliers
and a blowtorch.

1353
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,600
You hear me talkin',
hillbilly boy ?

1354
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:55,300
I ain't through with you
by a damn sight !

1355
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:58,200
I'm gonna get medieval
on your ass.

1356
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:04,100
I meant what now
between me and you.

1357
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,300
Oh, that "what now."

1358
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:16,400
I tell you what now
between me and you.

1359
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:20,800
There is no me and you.

1360
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:24,000
Not no more.

1361
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:28,800
So, are we cool ?

1362
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:32,300
Yeah, we cool.

1363
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,400
Two things.

1364
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:38,900
Don't tell nobody about this.

1365
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:43,800
This shit is between me, you...

1366
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:48,200
and Mr. "Soon-To-Be-Livin'
The-Rest-Of-His-Short-Ass-
Life-ln-Agonizing-Pain"...

1367
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:50,100
rapist here.

1368
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:54,000
It ain't nobody else's business.

1369
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:55,900
Two:

1370
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,300
You leave town tonight.
Right now.

1371
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,400
And when you gone,

1372
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:04,300
you stay gone,

1373
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,200
or you be gone.

1374
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:10,100
You lost all your L.A. privileges.
Deal ?

1375
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:13,700
Deal.

1376
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:16,700
Get your ass outta here.

1377
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:44,300
Oh, shit.

1378
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:18,200
Fabienne !

1379
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:22,100
Fabienne !

1380
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:25,300
Fabienne !
Come on, baby.

1381
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:28,600
- Come on. Get your shit.
We gotta go right now.
- I was so worried.

1382
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:32,000
- What about our bags ?
- Fuck the bags; if we don't split
right now, we'll miss the train.

1383
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:33,900
- I'll be downstairs.
- Is everything well ?

1384
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,800
- Just come on ! No talking now !
- Are we in danger ?

1385
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:43,000
Come on, honey !

1386
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,300
Where did you get
this motorcycle ?

1387
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:51,700
- It's not a motorcycle, baby.
It's a chopper. Let's go.
- What happened to my Honda ?

1388
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:55,400
I'm sorry, baby,
I had to crash that Honda.
Will you come on now, please ?

1389
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,800
Come on. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1390
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:05,500
- You're hurt ?
- No, no, I might've broken
my nose. It's no biggie.

1391
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:08,400
Come on. Hop on.
Baby, please, we--

1392
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:11,200
Honey, we gotta hit
the fuckin' road ! Get on !

1393
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:16,100
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
Come here, come here.

1394
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,100
I'm sorry. Mmm.

1395
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:21,900
- I'm so sorry.
- You were gone so long, I started
to think dreadful thoughts.

1396
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,800
I didn't mean to worry you.
Everything's fine.

1397
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,700
- How was your breakfast ?
- It was good.

1398
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,600
Did you get
the blueberry pancakes ?

1399
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:32,500
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get
buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay ?

1400
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:35,300
Since I left you,
this has been, without a doubt,

1401
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:38,500
the single weirdest
fuckin' day of my life--
I'll tell you all about it.

1402
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:40,400
Gotta go. Come on.

1403
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,100
Butch, whose motorcycle
is this ?

1404
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:45,600
- It's a chopper, baby.
- Whose chopper is this ?

1405
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:47,600
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed ?

1406
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,100
Zed's dead, baby.
Zed's dead.

1407
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,800
Yes, you did, Brett !

1408
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:11,300
You tried to fuck him,
and Marsellus Wallace
don't liked to be fucked...

1409
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,700
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1410
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:16,700
- Oh, God, please. I don't wanna die.
- You read the Bible, Brett ?

1411
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,100
- Yes !
- Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

1412
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:22,200
Sorta fits the occasion.

1413
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:25,400
Ezekiel 25:17.

1414
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:29,500
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

1415
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:31,600
by the inequities
of the selfish...

1416
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,900
and the tyranny of evil men.

1417
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,500
Blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will,

1418
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:42,400
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

1419
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:44,900
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

1420
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,600
and the finder
of lost children.

1421
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:51,700
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...

1422
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:53,900
and furious anger...

1423
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,000
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

1424
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:02,000
And you will know
My name is the Lord...

1425
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,300
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee."

1426
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:15,400
I'm fucked.
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1427
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:18,300
- ls he a friend of yours ?
- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.

1428
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:21,200
Hmm ? Oh.
Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.

1429
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:24,000
- Better tell him to shut up.
He's gettin' on my nerves.
- Fuck.

1430
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:27,200
Marvin. Marvin !
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1431
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:31,200
Die, you motherfuckers ! Die !

1432
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:01,500
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom ?

1433
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:04,300
Slip your mind ? Did you forget
that someone was in there...

1434
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,300
with a goddamn hand cannon ?

1435
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:10,100
You see the size of that gun he fired
at us ? It was bigger than him.

1436
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:17,300
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1437
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:19,200
I know.
We was lucky.

1438
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:22,300
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.

1439
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:26,300
- Yeah, maybe.
- This was divine intervention.

1440
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,300
You know what
divine intervention is ?

1441
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:35,800
I think so.

1442
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:39,100
That means that God came down
from Heaven and stopped the bullets.

1443
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:41,500
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1444
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:44,400
God came down from Heaven
and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1445
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,500
I think it's time for us
to leave, Jules.

1446
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:49,900
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off !

1447
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,800
- What just happened here
was a fuckin' miracle !
- Chill. This shit happens.

1448
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:56,500
Wrong ! Wrong.
This shit doesn't "just happen."

1449
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:59,900
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion in a car...

1450
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:02,300
or in a jailhouse
with the cops ?

1451
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:04,900
We should be fuckin' dead,
my friend !

1452
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:08,900
What happened here was a miracle, and I
want you to fucking acknowledge it !

1453
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:13,600
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now ?

1454
01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:23,500
Let's go, nigger !
Come on ! Shit.

1455
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:27,000
You ever seen that show Cops ?

1456
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:29,900
I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on,

1457
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,800
and he was talkin' about this
gunfight he had in the hallway
with this guy, right ?

1458
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:37,100
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'
happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1459
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:40,000
Okay ? It was just
him and this guy.

1460
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:43,300
I mean, you know, it's,
it's freaky, but it happens.

1461
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:48,100
You wanna play blind man,
go walk with the shepherd,
but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.

1462
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:51,000
- What the fuck does that mean ?
- It means that's it for me.

1463
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,600
From here on in, you can
consider my ass retired.

1464
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:55,800
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.
- Don't blaspheme.

1465
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:58,800
- I said, don't do that !
- Hey, why are you fuckin'
freakin' out on us ?

1466
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:01,800
Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today--
I'm through.

1467
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:04,700
- Why don't you tell him
at the same time why ?
- Don't worry, I will.

1468
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:08,600
- And I bet you $10,000
he laughs his ass off.
- I don't give a damn if he does.

1469
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:11,600
Marvin, what do you make of all this ?

1470
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:14,000
Man, I don't even
have an opinion.

1471
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:18,100
You gotta have an opinion. You think
God came down from Heaven and stopped--

1472
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:20,100
What the fuck's happenin' ?

1473
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:22,000
- Aw, shit, man !
- Aw, man !

1474
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:24,900
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
- Why the fuck'd you do that ?

1475
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,800
I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

1476
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:29,700
- Man, I seen some crazy-ass
shit in my time, but this--
- Chill out, man !

1477
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:32,600
It was an accident. We probably
went over a bump or somethin'.

1478
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:34,500
The car ain't hit
no motherfuckin' bump.

1479
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:37,800
I didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1480
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:41,200
Look at this fuckin' mess ! We're on
a city street in broad daylight here !

1481
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:44,000
- I don't believe it !
- Well, believe it now, motherfucker !

1482
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:47,400
We gotta get this car off
the road. Cops notice shit
like a car drenched in blood.

1483
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:50,300
- Just take it to
a friendly place, that's all !
- This is the Valley, Vincent.

1484
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,700
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places in the Valley.

1485
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,600
- Well, Jules, this ain't
my fuckin' town, man !
- Shit !

1486
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:58,500
- What you doing ?
- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1487
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:01,900
-Where's Toluca Lake ?
-Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1488
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,800
If Jimmie's ass ain't home,
I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,

1489
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:07,700
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1490
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:10,600
Jimmie, how you doin', man ?
It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

1491
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:14,400
Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we
gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1492
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:16,600
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

1493
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,800
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

1494
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:24,400
He's one remark away
from kickin' our asses out the door.

1495
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:27,300
- If he does, what do we do ?
- We ain't leavin'
'til we make a couple calls,

1496
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:30,100
but I don't want it to reach
that pitch-- Jimmie's a friend.

1497
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:33,000
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

1498
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:34,900
Just tell him
not to be abusive.

1499
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,900
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

1500
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:40,000
Put yourself in his position--
It's 8:00 in the morning,
he just woke up.

1501
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,900
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1502
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,800
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

1503
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,600
If that favor means I gotta
take shit, he can stick that
favor straight up his ass.

1504
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:52,400
- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd
you just do to his towel, man ?
- I was dryin' my hands !

1505
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:55,300
- You're supposed to wash 'em first !
- You watched me wash 'em.

1506
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:58,800
- I watched you get 'em wet.
- I was washin' 'em.
This shit's hard to get off.

1507
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:00,700
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1508
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,700
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did,

1509
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:05,500
and when I finished, the towel
didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad !

1510
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:08,400
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this ?

1511
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:12,400
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head, man !

1512
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:15,800
Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right ?

1513
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:20,100
You know I respect you and all.
But just don't put me
in this position, all right ?

1514
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,800
All right.
Fine. Fine.

1515
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:25,700
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

1516
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:28,500
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1517
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:33,000
Mmm ! Goddamn, Jimmie !

1518
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
This some serious
gourmet shit.

1519
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:37,000
Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...

1520
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,900
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice.

1521
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,800
Right ?

1522
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:43,700
And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

1523
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:45,700
- What flavor is this ?
- Knock it off, Julie.

1524
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:49,700
- What ?
- I don't need you to tell me
how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1525
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:52,100
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1526
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,100
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

1527
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:57,600
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1528
01:53:57,700 --> 01:54:01,500
But you know what's on
my mind right now ? It ain't
the coffee in my kitchen.

1529
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:03,600
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

1530
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:07,000
- Jimmie, don't even worry--
- Don't tell me about anything.
I wanna ask you a question.

1531
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,900
When you came pulling in here,

1532
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
did you notice the sign
on the front of my house that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage" ?

1533
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:15,400
- You know I ain't seen no--
- Did you notice the sign on
the front of my house...

1534
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:17,300
that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage" ?

1535
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:20,000
No. I didn't.

1536
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:22,900
- You know why you didn't
see that sign ?
- Why ?

1537
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:27,300
'Cause it ain't there,
'cause storing dead niggers
ain't my fuckin' business, that's why !

1538
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:30,200
- We're not gonna store
the motherfucker--
- Don't you fuckin' realize...

1539
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:34,500
that if Bonnie comes home and
finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced ?

1540
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:37,700
No marriage counselor.
No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1541
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:41,000
Okay ? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced !

1542
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:45,800
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1543
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:47,900
Jimmie, Jimmie,
she ain't gonna leave you.

1544
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,700
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules !
Okay ? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.

1545
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:55,600
There's nothin' you're gonna
say that's gonna make me forget
I love my wife. Is there ?

1546
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:03,100
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

1547
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:06,100
The graveyard shift
at the hospital.

1548
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:09,100
You gotta make some phone calls ?
You gotta call some people ?

1549
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:13,000
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

1550
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,800
That's Kool and the Gang.
We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1551
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:18,700
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in.

1552
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:21,600
You're fucking my shit up
right now !

1553
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:24,700
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.

1554
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:28,100
Do me that favor, all right ?
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.

1555
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:31,000
Well, say she comes home.

1556
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,400
What do you think she'll do ?

1557
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:37,100
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

1558
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:39,300
That ain't no kinda answer.

1559
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:42,300
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much ? A lot or a little ?

1560
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:45,100
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...

1561
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:47,100
this Bonnie situation is.

1562
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:50,900
She comes home from a hard day's work,
finds a bunch of gangsters
in her kitchen...

1563
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,800
doing a bunch of gangster shit,

1564
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:55,800
there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.

1565
01:55:57,900 --> 01:55:59,800
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.

1566
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:02,300
All I'm doing is
contemplating the ifs.

1567
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:05,200
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs !

1568
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:09,000
All I want to hear from your ass
is, "You ain't got no problem,
Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.

1569
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:13,100
Chill them niggers out
and wait for the cavalry,
which should be coming directly."

1570
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:16,200
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

1571
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:18,300
I'm on the motherfucker.

1572
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:23,200
Chill them niggers out and wait for
the Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1573
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:25,700
You sendin' the Wolf ?

1574
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:27,800
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker ?

1575
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:30,100
Shit, yeah, negro !

1576
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:33,100
That's all you had to say !

1577
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:36,300
She the hysterical type ?

1578
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:39,200
When is she due ?

1579
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:41,200
Mm-hmm.

1580
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:43,200
Give me
the principals' names again.

1581
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:45,100
Place your bets.

1582
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:49,600
- Jules. Mm-hmm.
- Cards, please.

1583
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:51,500
Vincent.

1584
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:57,900
Jimmie.

1585
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:01,200
Bonnie. Mm-hmm.

1586
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:09,300
It's thirty minutes away.
I'll be there in ten.

1587
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:28,300
You're... Jimmie, right ?
This is your house ?

1588
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:31,800
- It sure is.
- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1589
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:34,700
- Good. We got one.
- So I heard. May I come in ?

1590
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,600
Uh, yeah. Please do.

1591
01:57:36,700 --> 01:57:40,200
You must be Jules.
Which would make you... Vincent.

1592
01:57:40,300 --> 01:57:42,600
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1593
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:45,500
If I was informed correctly, the clock
is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie ?

1594
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,400
Uh, one hundred percent.

1595
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:51,200
- Your wife Bonnie comes home
at 9:30 in the a.m., correct ?
- Uh-huh.

1596
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:55,600
I was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here,
she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1597
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:59,700
- She wouldn't at that.
- That gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta Dodge,

1598
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:03,200
which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.

1599
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:07,200
Now, you got a corpse
in a car, minus a head,
in a garage. Take me to it.

1600
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,700
- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

1601
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,000
Do me a favor, will ya ? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

1602
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:23,400
- Would you make me a cup ?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

1603
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:27,600
Oh, uh, um,
how do you take it ?

1604
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:30,200
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1605
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:35,400
About the car, is there anything
I need to know ? Does it stall ?

1606
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:38,800
Does it smoke ? Does it make
a lot of noise ? ls there gas in it ?

1607
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:42,200
- Aside from how it looks,
the car's cool.
- Positive ?

1608
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:45,500
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1609
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:49,500
- As far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top.
- Good enough.

1610
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:51,500
Let's go back
to the kitchen.

1611
01:58:56,900 --> 01:58:59,700
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.

1612
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:06,200
Mmm.

1613
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:09,300
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1614
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:12,200
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1615
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:14,900
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1616
01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:18,700
- That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.
- Yeah. Under the sink.

1617
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:22,100
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

1618
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:26,000
and clean the inside of the car--
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1619
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:29,800
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1620
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:32,700
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1621
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:35,600
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1622
01:59:35,700 --> 01:59:39,700
Just give it a good once-over.
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

1623
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:43,800
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1624
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:46,300
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1625
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:49,100
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1626
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:52,700
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

1627
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:57,800
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

1628
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:59,800
with quilts and blankets,

1629
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:03,600
so if a cop starts stickin'
his big snout in the car,
the subterfuge won't last,

1630
02:00:03,700 --> 02:00:06,400
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1631
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:08,500
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1632
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:10,200
"Please" would be nice.

1633
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:14,400
- Come again ?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

1634
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:19,900
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1635
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:24,500
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1636
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:26,900
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1637
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,700
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1638
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:34,000
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1639
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,800
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay ? I respect you.

1640
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:39,600
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1641
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:42,600
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1642
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:47,100
I think fast, I talk fast,
and I need you guys to act fast
if you wanna get out of this.

1643
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:50,500
So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

1644
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:58,300
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right ? I can feel your look.

1645
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:03,500
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1646
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:07,300
Green.

1647
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:11,700
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1648
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:16,100
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1649
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:19,400
Nobody who'll be missed.

1650
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:24,200
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1651
02:01:25,300 --> 02:01:27,100
- How we comin', Jimmie ?
- Pretty good.

1652
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:30,200
I got it all here, but, uh,

1653
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:33,600
- Mr. Wolf,
you gotta understand something.
- Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1654
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:37,100
Okay. You gotta
understand something, uh, Winston.

1655
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:39,000
Uh-- Uh, no,
thank you.

1656
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:42,100
Uh, this is
our best linen here,

1657
02:01:42,100 --> 02:01:44,900
and it's, uh--
it was a wedding present...

1658
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,300
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

1659
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:51,700
- They're not with us anymore.
I wanna help--
- Let me ask you a question.

1660
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:54,500
- If you don't mind.
- No, no, please. Go ahead.

1661
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:00,700
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,
were they millionaires ?

1662
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:03,700
No.

1663
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:06,100
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1664
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:09,500
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1665
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:11,900
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here,

1666
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:15,900
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

1667
02:02:16,100 --> 02:02:19,100
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1668
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:26,700
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1669
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:29,600
How about you, Jimmie ?

1670
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:32,700
You an oak man ?

1671
02:02:33,700 --> 02:02:35,600
Oak's nice.

1672
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:44,900
Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

1673
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,300
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

1674
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:50,700
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he is wrong...

1675
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:53,500
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings ?

1676
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:56,400
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit !

1677
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:59,200
The motherfucker that said
that shit never had to pick up
itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1678
02:02:59,300 --> 02:03:02,900
- on account of your dumb ass.
- I got a threshold, Jules,
for the abuse that I will take.

1679
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,400
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1680
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:09,800
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1681
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:11,700
That's all.
I could blow.

1682
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:13,600
- Oh, you ready to blow ?
- Yeah.

1683
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:16,500
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1684
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:19,400
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1685
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:21,300
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1686
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:24,200
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back ?

1687
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:27,400
You're the motherfucker should be on
brain detail ! We're fuckin' switchin'.

1688
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:29,800
I'm washin' windows, and you're
pickin' up this nigger's skull !

1689
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:41,000
Fine job, gentlemen.

1690
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:44,600
You may get out of this yet.

1691
02:03:44,700 --> 02:03:47,000
I can't believe
this is the same car.

1692
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:50,400
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1693
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:53,700
Phase one is complete-- Clean the car--
which moves us right along to Phase two:

1694
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:55,700
Clean you two.

1695
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:58,900
Strip.

1696
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,600
- All the way ?
- To your bare ass.

1697
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:05,700
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1698
02:04:05,700 --> 02:04:08,600
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1699
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:11,000
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1700
02:04:11,100 --> 02:04:13,000
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary ?

1701
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:15,300
- You know what you two look like ?
- What ?

1702
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:18,600
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

1703
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:21,900
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1704
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:28,400
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1705
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:32,800
Don't do nothin' stupid,
like leavin' this shit out front
for the garbageman to pick up.

1706
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:36,800
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

1707
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:40,100
- Vincent.
- Okay, gentlemen.

1708
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:43,500
You both been to County before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.

1709
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:46,400
- Goddamn ! The water's fuckin' cold !
- Yo ! Yo ! Yo !

1710
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:49,600
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1711
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:52,500
Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around.

1712
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:55,300
- Get 'em there a little bit.
Vincent's hair.
- Hey, get out of my hair !

1713
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:58,100
- Come on. Do it, goddamn it ! Do it !
- Uh, um--

1714
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:01,000
Towel.

1715
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:14,100
You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

1716
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:17,300
Perfect.

1717
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:20,700
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1718
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,600
You guys look like--

1719
02:05:22,700 --> 02:05:25,000
What do they look like,
Jimmie ?

1720
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:28,600
Dorks. They look like
a couple of dorks.

1721
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:32,000
Ha-ha-ha. They're your
clothes, motherfucker.

1722
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:34,700
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way
right into prison.

1723
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:36,600
Don't make me beg.

1724
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:42,800
Okay, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

1725
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:46,300
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1726
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:49,200
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1727
02:05:49,300 --> 02:05:51,100
The place is North Hollywood,

1728
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:55,000
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1729
02:05:55,100 --> 02:05:58,300
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1730
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:01,500
Vincent, you follow
in my Acura.

1731
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:05,300
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws,

1732
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:08,300
- nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something.
- Right.

1733
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:11,200
- What did I say ?
- Don't do shit unless.

1734
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:13,500
- Unless what ?
- Unless you do it first.

1735
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:15,900
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1736
02:06:15,900 --> 02:06:19,200
How about you, Lash LaRue ?
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling ?

1737
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:23,200
The gun went off. I don't know why.
I'm cool. I promise you.

1738
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:26,100
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1739
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:28,600
If get my car back
any different than I gave it,

1740
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:31,400
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

1741
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:36,700
Outta my way, Rex.

1742
02:06:38,300 --> 02:06:40,600
- We cool ?
- Like it never happened.

1743
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:44,300
- All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

1744
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:46,900
Someday all this will be hers.

1745
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:49,700
Hi. So, what's
with the outfits ?

1746
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:53,000
You guys going to
a volleyball game or something ?

1747
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:55,400
I'm takin' milady
out for breakfast.

1748
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:58,200
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live ?

1749
02:06:58,200 --> 02:06:59,500
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

1750
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:02,900
It's--
It's your future. I--

1751
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,600
I see a--
a cab ride.

1752
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:08,500
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.

1753
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:11,400
- Good night, Raquel.
- I'll see you guys around.

1754
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:13,800
Stay outta trouble,
you crazy kids.

1755
02:07:13,900 --> 02:07:17,600
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.

1756
02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:20,500
Yeah, really.
And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.

1757
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:22,400
Call me Winston.

1758
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,800
You see that, young lady ? Respect.

1759
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:30,800
- Respect for one's elders
shows character.
- I have character.

1760
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:34,800
Because you are a character
doesn't mean that you have character.

1761
02:07:41,100 --> 02:07:43,900
Wanna share a cab ?

1762
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I'd go for some breakfast.
Feel like havin' breakfast with me ?

1763
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:50,800
Cool.

1764
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:57,700
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.

1765
02:07:57,700 --> 02:08:01,000
- Yeah, he's about as European
as fuckin' English Bob.
- I know that now.

1766
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:03,400
- But was he cool or what ?
- Thank you.

1767
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:05,800
Totally fuckin' cool,
in control.

1768
02:08:05,900 --> 02:08:09,800
Didn't even really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1769
02:08:09,900 --> 02:08:12,400
Want some bacon ?

1770
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:14,300
No, man, I don't eat pork.

1771
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:17,600
- Are you Jewish ?
- I ain't Jewish; I just don't
dig on swine, that's all.

1772
02:08:17,700 --> 02:08:20,500
- Why not ?
- Pigs are filthy animals.

1773
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:22,400
I don't eat filthy animals.

1774
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:25,800
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.

1775
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:28,700
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,
but I'd never know...

1776
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:31,600
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

1777
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:34,400
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

1778
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:38,300
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got
sense enough to disregard its own feces.

1779
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:42,400
- What about a dog ?
Dog eats its own feces.
- I don't eat dog either.

1780
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:45,800
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal ?

1781
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:48,700
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,

1782
02:08:48,700 --> 02:08:50,600
but they're definitely dirty.

1783
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:54,600
- But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.
- Ah, so, by that rationale,

1784
02:08:54,700 --> 02:08:58,100
if a pig had a better personality,
he would cease to be a filthy animal.

1785
02:08:58,200 --> 02:09:01,900
- Is that true ?
- We'd have to be talkin' about
one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1786
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,900
I mean, he'd have to be
ten times more charming than
that Arnold on Green Acres.

1787
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:13,300
Oh, man, that's good.

1788
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:16,800
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.

1789
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:19,700
You've been sittin' there,
all serious and shit.

1790
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:22,200
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
- About what ?

1791
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:25,000
- About the miracle we witnessed.
- Miracle you witnessed.

1792
02:09:25,100 --> 02:09:28,200
- I witnessed a freak occurrence.
- What is a miracle, Vincent ?

1793
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:33,100
- Act of God.
- And what's an act of God ?

1794
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:40,100
When, um, God makes
the impossible possible.

1795
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:43,000
But this morning...

1796
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:45,700
- I don't think qualifies.
- Hey, Vincent.

1797
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:49,300
See, that shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.

1798
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:54,100
It could be God stopped the bullets,
changed Coke to Pepsi,
found my car keys.

1799
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:57,000
You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.

1800
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:59,400
Now, whether or not
what we experienced...

1801
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:02,500
was an according-to-Hoyle miracle
is insignificant.

1802
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:06,200
But what is significant is,
I felt the touch of God.

1803
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:08,100
God got involved.

1804
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:09,900
But why ?

1805
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:12,800
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:
I don't know why.

1806
02:10:12,900 --> 02:10:15,800
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.

1807
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:17,700
You're really thinkin'
about quittin'.

1808
02:10:17,700 --> 02:10:20,300
- For life ? Most definitely.
- Yeah.

1809
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:23,600
Fuck.
What you gonna do then ?

1810
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:28,800
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.

1811
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,400
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.

1812
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:35,500
Then, basically, I'm just
gonna walk the Earth.

1813
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:38,800
- What you mean, "walk the Earth" ?
- Like Caine in Kung Fu.

1814
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:41,700
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

1815
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:44,000
And how long do you intend
to walk the Earth ?

1816
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,200
- 'Til God puts me
where He wants me to be.
- What if He don't do that ?

1817
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:52,000
- If it takes forever,
then I'll walk forever.
- So you decided to be a bum.

1818
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:55,600
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.

1819
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:57,500
No, Jules,
you decided to be a bum,

1820
02:10:57,600 --> 02:11:00,800
just like all those pieces of shit
out there who beg for change,

1821
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:03,700
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.

1822
02:11:03,700 --> 02:11:06,600
They got a name for that, Jules.
It's called a bum.

1823
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:10,100
And without a job,
a residence or legal tender,
that's what you're gonna be, man.

1824
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:12,100
You're gonna be
a fuckin' bum.

1825
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:15,000
Look, my friend,
this is just where you and I differ.

1826
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,700
Garçon ! Coffee !

1827
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:22,100
Jules, look, what happened this morning,
man, I agree it was peculiar.

1828
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:25,200
- But water into wine, l--
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1829
02:11:25,300 --> 02:11:28,200
- Don't fuckin' talk
to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you,

1830
02:11:28,300 --> 02:11:30,800
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

1831
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:35,400
I'm gonna take a shit.

1832
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:41,800
Let me ask you something.

1833
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:43,900
When did you make this decision ?
When you were sittin' there
eatin' that muffin ?

1834
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,800
Yeah. I was sittin' here
eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,

1835
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:49,700
replayin' the incident
in my head,

1836
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:53,400
when I had what alcoholics refer to
as a moment of clarity.

1837
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:56,500
Fuck. To be continued.

1838
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,800
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

1839
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:15,200
Everybody be cool !
This is a robbery !

1840
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:20,000
Any one of you fucking pricks move,
and I'll execute every one
of you motherfuckers !

1841
02:12:20,100 --> 02:12:23,300
- You got that ?
You just be quiet over there !
- Waitresses on the floor !

1842
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:26,300
Get on the fuckin'--
Get the fuck down !

1843
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:31,000
You're in a blind spot.
Take your dames over to that booth,
on the count of ten !

1844
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:35,400
- Mexicans, out of
the fucking kitchen !
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8--

1845
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:38,400
What the fuck are you doing,
you fucking yuppie ? Get down !

1846
02:12:38,500 --> 02:12:40,900
- Get down !
- Throw those bags !

1847
02:12:40,900 --> 02:12:43,300
Fucking move ! Move !

1848
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:45,600
Move ! Get the fuck--

1849
02:12:45,700 --> 02:12:48,600
Get down on the fucking floor !

1850
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:50,500
Grandpa ! Down !

1851
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:53,800
I'm the manager here, and there's
no problem. No problem at all.

1852
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:56,700
- You gonna give me a problem ?
- No, sir, I'm not.

1853
02:12:56,700 --> 02:13:00,600
Thought you said you were gonna
give me a fucking problem !

1854
02:13:00,700 --> 02:13:05,200
- I think we got
a hero here, Honey Bunny.
- Well, just execute him !

1855
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:07,100
I am not a hero.

1856
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:10,100
- I'm just a coffee shop manager.
- Get the fuck down !

1857
02:13:10,100 --> 02:13:11,800
The restaurant's ours !

1858
02:13:11,900 --> 02:13:14,700
Just take whatever you want.

1859
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:16,600
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

1860
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:19,700
You tell them to be fucking cool
and everything will be over.

1861
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:21,700
- You understand me ?
- Yes !

1862
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:25,600
Listen, everybody.

1863
02:13:25,700 --> 02:13:27,600
Be calm, cooperate,

1864
02:13:27,700 --> 02:13:30,500
and this'll all be over
in a minute !

1865
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:32,400
Get the fuck down !
Well done.

1866
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:47,600
All right, now, people, gonna
come around and collect your wallets !

1867
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:51,000
You don't fucking talk. You just
throw 'em in the bag ! Are we clear ?

1868
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,200
I said, are we fucking clear ?

1869
02:13:53,200 --> 02:13:56,100
Good !
Now, wallets out !

1870
02:13:56,100 --> 02:13:59,600
That's it.
Get the fuck down. In the bag.

1871
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:02,400
- In the fucking bag !
- I don't
have nothin' on me, man.

1872
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:04,300
In the bag.

1873
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:07,200
What am I waiting for ?
ln the fucking bag.

1874
02:14:07,300 --> 02:14:10,100
Laura. Laura. Tips.
In the bag.

1875
02:14:10,100 --> 02:14:12,300
- Is that a cellular phone ?
- Yeah.

1876
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:14,200
In the fucking bag.

1877
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:19,000
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.

1878
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:21,400
In the bag.
In the bag.

1879
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:35,000
In the bag.

1880
02:14:49,500 --> 02:14:52,300
- What's in the case ?
- My boss's dirty laundry.

1881
02:14:52,300 --> 02:14:54,800
- Your boss makes you do his laundry ?
- When he wants it clean.

1882
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:57,400
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1883
02:14:57,500 --> 02:15:00,300
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.

1884
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:04,500
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, you did.

1885
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:07,800
What's going on ?

1886
02:15:07,900 --> 02:15:11,200
- Looks like we got
a vigilante in our midst.
- Shoot him in the face !

1887
02:15:11,200 --> 02:15:14,800
I hate to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time
I've had a gun pointed at me.

1888
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:18,200
- If you don't take your hand off
that case, it'll be your last.
- Stop causing problems !

1889
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:20,900
You'll get us all killed ! Give 'em
what you got and get 'em outta here !

1890
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Shut the fuck up, fat man ! This ain't
none of your goddamn business !

1891
02:15:25,100 --> 02:15:27,200
Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.

1892
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:29,300
No problem.
I got it under control.

1893
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:32,700
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1894
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:38,100
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

1895
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:44,100
We clear ?

1896
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:49,000
One.

1897
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:53,200
Two.

1898
02:15:53,300 --> 02:15:55,200
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

1899
02:15:55,300 --> 02:15:57,300
You win.

1900
02:15:57,400 --> 02:15:59,200
It's yours.

1901
02:16:03,100 --> 02:16:05,700
Open it.

1902
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:11,600
Hey, what is it ?

1903
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:13,900
What is it ?

1904
02:16:13,900 --> 02:16:16,400
Is that what I think it is ?

1905
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:19,100
Mm-hmm.

1906
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:22,600
It's beautiful.

1907
02:16:22,700 --> 02:16:25,200
Goddamn it, what is it ?

1908
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:29,400
You let him go !
You let him go !

1909
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:32,300
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you !
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

1910
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:35,200
- Say, "Bitch, be cool !"
Say, "Bitch, be cool !"
- Be cool ! Be cool !

1911
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:37,900
- Tell that bitch to chill !
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad !

1912
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:40,700
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out !
- Chill out, Honey Bunny !

1913
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:42,500
- Let go of him !
- Chill out, Honey Bunny !

1914
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:45,400
- Now, promise her
it's gonna be all right !
- I promise !

1915
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:47,300
- Tell her to chill !
- Chill out, Honey Bunny !

1916
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:49,200
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

1917
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:52,600
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we ?

1918
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:55,400
- Don't you hurt him !
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody !

1919
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:58,900
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like ?

1920
02:16:58,900 --> 02:17:02,400
- Come on, Yolanda !
What's Fonzie like ?
- He's cool.

1921
02:17:02,500 --> 02:17:04,400
- What ?
- Cool.

1922
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:07,100
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

1923
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:09,100
We're gonna be cool.

1924
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:13,800
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

1925
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:15,900
And when I count three,

1926
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,800
I want you to
let go of your gun,

1927
02:17:18,900 --> 02:17:22,200
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

1928
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:25,200
And when you do it,

1929
02:17:25,300 --> 02:17:27,200
you do it cool.

1930
02:17:27,300 --> 02:17:29,500
You ready ?

1931
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:31,600
One,

1932
02:17:31,700 --> 02:17:33,800
two,

1933
02:17:33,900 --> 02:17:35,700
three.

1934
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:45,400
- Okay, now you let him go !
- Yolanda !

1935
02:17:45,500 --> 02:17:48,900
I thought you were gonna
be cool. Now, when you yell
at me, it makes me nervous.

1936
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

1937
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:54,800
When motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

1938
02:17:56,300 --> 02:17:59,800
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

1939
02:17:59,900 --> 02:18:03,100
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

1940
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:05,100
But I don't want that.

1941
02:18:05,100 --> 02:18:07,000
And you don't want that.

1942
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:09,700
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

1943
02:18:09,700 --> 02:18:11,700
So let's see what we can do.

1944
02:18:14,100 --> 02:18:17,200
Now... here's the situation.

1945
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:20,900
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

1946
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:24,300
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

1947
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:27,200
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

1948
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:31,000
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

1949
02:18:31,100 --> 02:18:33,900
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

1950
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,800
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

1951
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:38,600
Vincent !

1952
02:18:38,700 --> 02:18:41,500
- Be cool ! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back !

1953
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:44,200
It's cool !
We still just talkin'.

1954
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:48,200
Come on. Point the gun at me.
Point the gun at me. There you go.

1955
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:50,300
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

1956
02:18:50,300 --> 02:18:52,200
and don't do
a goddamn thing.

1957
02:18:52,300 --> 02:18:54,100
Tell her it's still cool.

1958
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:57,000
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby ?

1959
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:00,900
I-- I gotta go pee.

1960
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,800
I wanna go home.

1961
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:06,300
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

1962
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:09,200
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

1963
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:12,500
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

1964
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:15,600
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,

1965
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:19,500
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

1966
02:19:21,900 --> 02:19:25,700
- Which one is it ?
- It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."

1967
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:41,800
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

1968
02:19:41,900 --> 02:19:44,800
Open it up.
Take out the money.

1969
02:19:49,700 --> 02:19:51,800
Count it.

1970
02:19:57,800 --> 02:20:00,200
How much is there ?

1971
02:20:02,100 --> 02:20:03,900
About 1,500 dollars.

1972
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:07,100
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

1973
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:10,200
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,

1974
02:20:10,300 --> 02:20:12,300
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh ?

1975
02:20:12,300 --> 02:20:16,100
Jules, you give that fuckin'
nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll
shoot him on general principle.

1976
02:20:16,100 --> 02:20:19,400
No, Yolanda ! Yolanda ! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing !

1977
02:20:19,500 --> 02:20:21,500
Vince, shut the fuck up !

1978
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:25,300
- Shut up !
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

1979
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:28,200
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

1980
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:30,100
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

1981
02:20:31,300 --> 02:20:34,300
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo ?
- What ?

1982
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:39,000
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

1983
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,600
You read the Bible, Ringo ?

1984
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:44,500
Not regularly, no.

1985
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:46,900
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

1986
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:50,300
Ezekiel 25:17.

1987
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:53,100
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

1988
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:55,100
by the inequities
of the selfish...

1989
02:20:55,100 --> 02:20:57,000
and the tyranny of evil men.

1990
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:00,300
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

1991
02:21:00,300 --> 02:21:02,700
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

1992
02:21:02,700 --> 02:21:06,700
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

1993
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:10,700
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

1994
02:21:10,900 --> 02:21:13,900
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

1995
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:16,800
And you will know
I am the Lord...

1996
02:21:16,900 --> 02:21:20,300
when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

1997
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:23,700
I been sayin' that shit for years,

1998
02:21:23,800 --> 02:21:26,800
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

1999
02:21:26,900 --> 02:21:29,700
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2000
02:21:29,700 --> 02:21:32,600
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2001
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:35,000
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2002
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:38,300
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2003
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:41,200
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2004
02:21:41,300 --> 02:21:45,900
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2005
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,800
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

2006
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:52,300
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

2007
02:21:52,400 --> 02:21:54,200
Or it could mean...

2008
02:21:54,300 --> 02:21:57,600
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2009
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:01,400
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2010
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:03,700
Now, I'd like that.

2011
02:22:03,700 --> 02:22:06,500
But that shit
ain't the truth.

2012
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:08,400
The truth is,

2013
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:11,200
you're the weak...

2014
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:15,900
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

2015
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,100
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2016
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:23,100
I'm tryin' real hard...

2017
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:25,300
to be the shepherd.

2018
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,900
Go.

2019
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,200
I think we should be
leaving now.

2020
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:04,000
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

2021
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:38,000
