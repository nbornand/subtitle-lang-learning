1
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:09,182
Where is he? Where is he hiding?

2
00:03:12,473 --> 00:03:16,671
I don't know. I've been looking
for him since yesterday.

3
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:24,703
I'm gonna ask you for the last time.
Where is he?

4
00:03:25,593 --> 00:03:27,584
I don't know.

5
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:33,101
What are you gonna do to him?

6
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:51,748
Stay here in case
that rat shows up.

7
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:53,869
Okay.

8
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:13,270
Who you protecting,
you dumb asshole?

9
00:04:13,673 --> 00:04:16,870
A stoolie who rats on his own friends?

10
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:22,792
They were your friends too.

11
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:32,501
I got it. You wanna end up
like that bitch, huh?

12
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:50,672
At Chun Lao's. Chinese theater.

13
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:59,990
You stay here with this barrel of shit.

14
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,825
Noodles. Noodles. Noodles.

15
00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:17,553
Easy, easy...

16
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:38,704
This way. Hurry!

17
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:42,149
There down. Mott Street.
Go. Go. Go.

18
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:39,268
Noodles.

19
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:46,829
Noodles.

20
00:15:49,793 --> 00:15:51,749
Noodles.

21
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,864
Untie me.

22
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:58,231
Stay that way. No, stay.
I want them to know I did it.

23
00:16:00,513 --> 00:16:04,267
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go get Eve.

24
00:16:04,953 --> 00:16:06,102
Don't.

25
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:16,150
Why?

26
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:24,026
They... They already been there.

27
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:51,064
Do you need anything?

28
00:16:52,353 --> 00:16:53,581
Money?

29
00:16:56,913 --> 00:17:02,306
- I got more than I need.
- Yeah, it's all yours now.

30
00:19:00,113 --> 00:19:02,024
Where to?

31
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:11,424
Sir, where do you want to go?

32
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:17,749
Anywhere. First bus.

33
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:23,661
Buffalo?

34
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:28,190
One way.

35
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:32,987
That'll be $ 1.20.

36
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,066
I wanna rent a car.

37
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:44,622
Would you fill this out, please?

38
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,946
Noodles.

39
00:26:37,353 --> 00:26:40,425
I brought back
the key to your clock.

40
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:51,024
Lock the door.

41
00:27:04,113 --> 00:27:06,343
When did you get back?

42
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:09,192
Today.

43
00:27:09,353 --> 00:27:11,230
Why?

44
00:27:12,473 --> 00:27:14,429
They got in touch with me.

45
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:16,788
Who?

46
00:27:16,953 --> 00:27:18,989
I thought you might know.

47
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:20,711
Me?

48
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:24,263
I don't know nothing
about nobody no more.

49
00:27:45,153 --> 00:27:47,462
You gonna offer me a drink?

50
00:27:48,193 --> 00:27:50,832
Yeah, forgive me. Sure. Of course.

51
00:27:50,993 --> 00:27:52,984
Please sit down.

52
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:20,066
Who's Robert Williams?

53
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:23,872
I am.

54
00:28:30,113 --> 00:28:34,903
"We wish to inform you that following
the sale of the Beth Israel Cemetery..."

55
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:39,386
The synagogue sent these out if you
wanted to relocate your loved ones.

56
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:42,465
I got the same letter
on account of my father.

57
00:28:43,273 --> 00:28:47,551
Only the synagogue didn't send that.
I got that last week.

58
00:28:47,713 --> 00:28:50,352
The rabbi told me he
sent those out eight months ago.

59
00:28:50,513 --> 00:28:53,789
Yeah, that's right.
That's about when I got mine.

60
00:28:57,113 --> 00:28:59,104
So, what else did the rabbi say?

61
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:02,709
He said I was lucky.
The bodies of Philip Stein...

62
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:07,469
...Maximilian Bercovicz, Patrick
Goldberg were already spoken for.

63
00:29:07,673 --> 00:29:11,791
And they were up in
a very fancy cemetery in Riverdale.

64
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,023
What's this all mean?

65
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:18,945
It means...

66
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:25,828
..." Noodles, though you've been hiding in
the asshole of the world, we found you.

67
00:29:25,993 --> 00:29:27,790
We know where you are."

68
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:30,310
It means...

69
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:32,387
..."Get ready."

70
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,101
For what?

71
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:42,106
That's the one thing it didn't say.

72
00:30:09,913 --> 00:30:11,904
What do you think?

73
00:30:12,073 --> 00:30:16,032
I think the answer's here.
That's why I came back.

74
00:30:34,273 --> 00:30:37,071
I moved everything in here.

75
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:44,668
I had to sell the house,
the backroom.

76
00:30:45,873 --> 00:30:50,708
I always thought you might have
helped yourself to that million bucks.

77
00:30:50,873 --> 00:30:52,784
But now I know.

78
00:30:57,073 --> 00:30:59,633
You're on your ass worse than ever.

79
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,502
But I thought it was you who...

80
00:31:03,673 --> 00:31:05,823
No, you thought wrong.

81
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:10,261
The suitcase was empty.

82
00:31:12,553 --> 00:31:14,783
Then who took it?

83
00:31:18,913 --> 00:31:22,622
That's what I've been asking myself
for 35 years.

84
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:36,546
If it bothers you, I can sleep here.

85
00:31:36,713 --> 00:31:40,626
- You can have my room.
- No. It's okay.

86
00:31:59,633 --> 00:32:03,228
- How's your sister?
- I ain't seen her for years.

87
00:32:03,913 --> 00:32:06,268
She's a big star now.

88
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,782
We should have known, huh?

89
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:14,949
You can always tell the winners
at the starting gate.

90
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:19,421
You can always tell the winners,
and you can tell the losers.

91
00:32:20,993 --> 00:32:23,268
Who would've put a penny on you?

92
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,946
I'd have put everything
I ever had on you.

93
00:32:30,913 --> 00:32:33,063
Yeah, and you would've lost.

94
00:32:44,593 --> 00:32:48,472
Well, you're beat. Good night.

95
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:51,507
Good night, Moe. Thanks.

96
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:59,591
What have you been doing
all these years?

97
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,343
Been going to bed early.

98
00:37:43,193 --> 00:37:45,661
Deborah, Papa says you should help.

99
00:37:46,113 --> 00:37:47,341
No.

100
00:37:47,673 --> 00:37:50,790
We got customers all over.
We can't do everything.

101
00:37:50,953 --> 00:37:54,468
Try. I've got my elocution lessons.

102
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:47,511
Fat, you better spray the toilet.
I saw a cockroach in there.

103
00:39:03,353 --> 00:39:04,547
Sorry.

104
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:14,189
Sorry, I can't make it today.

105
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,264
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

106
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:25,865
Sorry, Fats.

107
00:39:32,993 --> 00:39:35,188
- Noodles!
- Bugsy's got a job for us.

108
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:37,309
Hurry up. He don't wait.

109
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,504
Who you calling a cockroach?

110
00:40:11,673 --> 00:40:14,745
So, what are you?
You're filthy, you make me sick.

111
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:18,872
You crawl up toilet walls
just like a roach. So, what are you?

112
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:20,546
Let go!

113
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:24,467
I make you sick, huh? Then how
come you showed me your tush?

114
00:40:25,313 --> 00:40:26,951
To a roach.

115
00:40:30,153 --> 00:40:33,623
Go look at yourself, David Aaronson.

116
00:40:47,393 --> 00:40:51,625
She don't leave me alone, I'm gonna
give her what she's asking for.

117
00:40:51,793 --> 00:40:54,261
- What's Bugsy want?
- We gotta wake up a deadbeat.

118
00:40:54,433 --> 00:40:57,391
That schmuck at the newsstand
didn't pay.

119
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:46,510
Here's your money, sir.

120
00:42:05,993 --> 00:42:07,426
Beautiful.

121
00:42:12,153 --> 00:42:14,951
Look at it, it looks great! Wow!

122
00:42:22,593 --> 00:42:24,185
Come on, guys.

123
00:42:32,193 --> 00:42:34,502
Come on, come on.

124
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:37,349
Now make up your mind.

125
00:42:37,713 --> 00:42:41,023
- Noodles, let's take the dollar.
- Yeah.

126
00:42:41,193 --> 00:42:43,582
Skip, here you go.

127
00:42:45,593 --> 00:42:47,106
That one.

128
00:42:48,073 --> 00:42:49,222
Him.

129
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:51,902
Hey, Sam, I'll see you next Thursday.

130
00:42:52,353 --> 00:42:53,832
That one.

131
00:42:57,073 --> 00:42:58,062
Are you nuts?

132
00:42:58,233 --> 00:43:02,306
Bugsy said we could take the dollar
or we could roll the drunk.

133
00:43:02,473 --> 00:43:04,668
Yeah, but he ain't even drunk yet.

134
00:43:05,353 --> 00:43:06,786
We'll wait.

135
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:14,224
- Well, you roll that one over there.
- What's to roll? He drunk it all.

136
00:43:18,953 --> 00:43:20,909
Bounce that little <i>shikker.</i>

137
00:44:07,993 --> 00:44:09,346
Jacket.

138
00:44:19,153 --> 00:44:21,030
It's Fartface.

139
00:44:24,553 --> 00:44:25,747
Shit!

140
00:44:27,593 --> 00:44:29,390
We should've took the dollar.

141
00:44:29,553 --> 00:44:33,262
Could've had 10 corned beef
sandwiches on poppy-seed rolls.

142
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:50,112
Look, the wagon will hide us
from Fartface. Get ready!

143
00:45:18,153 --> 00:45:20,223
Now! Throw your jacket over him.

144
00:45:22,313 --> 00:45:26,943
Hey, mister, you sick? Poor guy,
you'll be okay. Come on, I'll help ya.

145
00:45:27,113 --> 00:45:29,832
Come on, up you go.

146
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:32,553
Now, you're worse
than my Uncle Nathan.

147
00:45:32,713 --> 00:45:35,989
Why do you want to get soused?
I'll take you home.

148
00:45:36,153 --> 00:45:37,905
Go, Mama.

149
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:49,670
Stop right there. Hey, you!
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

150
00:45:50,953 --> 00:45:53,023
What are you kids doing here?

151
00:45:53,193 --> 00:45:56,868
- What are we kids doing here?
- We're getting it up the ass.

152
00:45:57,353 --> 00:46:00,470
Yeah, getting screwed.
Is there a law against it?

153
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:04,421
Can you spare a dime for
<i>pisherkehs</i> that just got it up the ass?

154
00:46:04,593 --> 00:46:07,266
Get out of here.
Get off the street.

155
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:09,708
Get out of here.
Get off the street.

156
00:46:09,873 --> 00:46:11,989
Go ahead. And don't come back.

157
00:46:12,153 --> 00:46:15,270
I don't want to see you here again.
All right?

158
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:49,472
Hey, stop by for you later.

159
00:46:52,033 --> 00:46:54,422
Yeah, but knock here on the john first.

160
00:46:56,113 --> 00:47:01,028
My old man's praying, and my old lady's
crying. And the light's turned off.

161
00:47:01,313 --> 00:47:06,148
What the hell should I go home for?
At least in here I can read.

162
00:48:05,753 --> 00:48:08,870
- Where are you going?
- Mama, don't get worked up.

163
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:10,864
You got pots to clean.

164
00:48:15,873 --> 00:48:20,105
I'll be right back, Ma.
I gotta go to the can.

165
00:48:27,273 --> 00:48:28,706
Hi, Peggy.

166
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:31,387
At least you could lock the door.

167
00:48:34,553 --> 00:48:36,066
Don't you like it?

168
00:48:43,393 --> 00:48:44,542
I've seen better.

169
00:48:45,273 --> 00:48:47,548
- You seen lots?
- How many you seen?

170
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:50,707
I'll tell you how many. None.

171
00:48:55,313 --> 00:48:56,792
Let me see yours.

172
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:13,307
Looksies, no feelsies.

173
00:49:16,073 --> 00:49:18,303
Peggy... Peggy, I...

174
00:49:22,953 --> 00:49:25,945
- You like it, don't you?
- Not for free, I don't.

175
00:49:26,153 --> 00:49:30,146
Bring me a charlotte russe,
and then you can do anything you like.

176
00:49:30,353 --> 00:49:33,026
Tomorrow. I'll bring it
to you tomorrow.

177
00:49:33,193 --> 00:49:36,071
- I'll bring it tomorrow.
- I don't give credit.

178
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:37,666
I promise. I promise.

179
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:41,826
You better stop squeezing me,
or I'm gonna poop in my pants.

180
00:49:48,073 --> 00:49:49,745
Well, you getting out?

181
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:38,188
Come on, come on.

182
00:51:04,313 --> 00:51:06,383
Give me six copies.

183
00:51:07,913 --> 00:51:10,871
Drop your pants
and I'll stick it to you again.

184
00:51:14,793 --> 00:51:17,990
- What do you mean, "again"?
- That's a long story.

185
00:51:18,153 --> 00:51:20,872
And look what time it is.

186
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:25,192
It's already 6:34. And I gotta go.

187
00:51:26,313 --> 00:51:28,702
Boy, I got a lot of work to do.

188
00:51:28,873 --> 00:51:30,750
Hold it a minute.

189
00:51:30,913 --> 00:51:35,384
Now it's 6:35.
And I ain't got a damn thing to do.

190
00:51:35,753 --> 00:51:39,428
Just you wait, asshole.
I'll do something with your time.

191
00:51:39,593 --> 00:51:40,867
Wait! Hey!

192
00:51:41,033 --> 00:51:43,228
Since we're talking about time...

193
00:51:43,393 --> 00:51:46,942
...it looks like you're gonna break
that lamp at 6:36.

194
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:49,786
- Where'd you pinch this?
- It's mine.

195
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:52,421
- Prove it.
- I gave it to him.

196
00:51:53,233 --> 00:51:54,825
Yeah?

197
00:51:55,593 --> 00:51:57,345
Who the hell are you?

198
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:00,593
- Where you from?
- The Bronx.

199
00:52:01,193 --> 00:52:03,343
And you give away watches?

200
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,744
He's my uncle.

201
00:52:06,313 --> 00:52:08,873
- And who gave it to you?
- My Uncle Nathan.

202
00:52:09,473 --> 00:52:11,225
My little brother.

203
00:52:11,713 --> 00:52:14,671
Tell your uncle
to stop by the precinct.

204
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:16,664
- He's dead.
- Alcoholic.

205
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,744
In Kishnev, Poland.

206
00:52:23,513 --> 00:52:27,631
Then he don't need it no more.
It's been requisitioned.

207
00:52:27,793 --> 00:52:32,150
- What's that mean?
- Pinched, by him. At 6:37.

208
00:52:32,313 --> 00:52:35,350
Just remember,
I got my eye on you two.

209
00:52:35,513 --> 00:52:37,663
I got my eye on you too.

210
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:42,304
Take it! Take it!
Take the lamp off. I can't hold it.

211
00:52:43,553 --> 00:52:44,781
Max.

212
00:52:48,913 --> 00:52:50,551
Who's this?

213
00:52:52,553 --> 00:52:54,191
My uncle.

214
00:53:12,993 --> 00:53:16,872
- That one. With the cream.
- The 5-cent one?

215
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,626
Yeah.

216
00:53:18,793 --> 00:53:23,071
For the twopenny one she only gives
you a hand job. I can do that myself.

217
00:53:24,473 --> 00:53:25,508
Not that one!

218
00:53:26,033 --> 00:53:27,591
That one.

219
00:53:28,553 --> 00:53:29,906
You sure?

220
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:32,829
Wrap it up pretty.

221
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:13,552
Good morning. Peggy home?

222
00:54:13,713 --> 00:54:15,590
She's taking a bath.

223
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:18,267
That's great.
Would you tell her I'm here?

224
00:54:18,433 --> 00:54:21,709
Hey, Ma. Another bucket of water.

225
00:54:22,953 --> 00:54:24,750
Wait.

226
00:56:48,193 --> 00:56:50,912
- What do you want?
- Me?

227
00:56:51,433 --> 00:56:56,223
- Mama said you were looking for me.
- No. The guys told me that...

228
00:56:56,393 --> 00:57:00,386
- What?
- I'll come back some other time.

229
00:57:33,953 --> 00:57:35,352
Noodles!

230
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:40,393
Noodles! Noodles! Noodles!

231
00:57:46,953 --> 00:57:48,352
Did you get it?

232
00:57:48,513 --> 00:57:53,667
- His asshole blinked, but we got him.
- Nice going, Fartface. And on duty too.

233
00:57:54,953 --> 00:57:57,672
You boys caught me
with my pants down that time.

234
00:57:57,833 --> 00:58:00,745
No, we caught you with
your schmuck in a minor.

235
00:58:00,913 --> 00:58:04,622
- Put this someplace safe.
- That's all right. Hey, hold it!

236
00:58:04,793 --> 00:58:06,988
Where you going?
Hold it! Wait a minute!

237
00:58:07,153 --> 00:58:08,871
Hey, you, stop! Hold it.

238
00:58:09,033 --> 00:58:13,823
- What are you gonna do with that plate?
- Depends. What time is it, Max?

239
00:58:13,993 --> 00:58:17,190
I think it's time
we got our watch back.

240
00:58:17,673 --> 00:58:20,585
- Okay, boys, we're even.
- The hell we are.

241
00:58:20,753 --> 00:58:23,108
You'll be collecting your
pension before we're even.

242
00:58:23,273 --> 00:58:24,831
Hiya, fellas.

243
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,385
What do you boys want?

244
00:58:27,553 --> 00:58:29,748
First off...

245
00:58:29,993 --> 00:58:31,984
...you're paying Peggy for us.

246
00:58:32,153 --> 00:58:34,189
Okay. That's it?

247
00:58:34,593 --> 00:58:36,663
Go ahead while I tell him.

248
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:41,065
I can't believe it. My first time,
and a lousy cop's paying for it.

249
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:45,868
Now, look, what else do you kids
want for that plate?

250
00:58:46,593 --> 00:58:52,384
Noodles was telling me about Bugsy.
Seems he's boss, thanks to you.

251
00:58:52,553 --> 00:58:55,545
- Meaning what?
- Meaning he pays you off.

252
00:58:55,713 --> 00:58:59,262
Will you slow down?
What is your hurry? Take it easy.

253
00:58:59,433 --> 00:59:02,391
If you keep this up,
you're gonna come too fast.

254
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:07,903
Do you see what I mean?
You're so stupid. I can't believe it.

255
00:59:08,113 --> 00:59:13,187
So why does Bugsy pay you?
What do you do for him?

256
00:59:14,393 --> 00:59:18,432
- I close an eye once in a while.
- Well, now you close an eye for us.

257
00:59:18,593 --> 00:59:21,665
Why? What are you kids up to?

258
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,786
He'll tell you.

259
00:59:26,953 --> 00:59:31,310
Me, him, Cockeye and Patsy,
we're working together.

260
00:59:31,633 --> 00:59:32,986
Bugsy'll flatten you.

261
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:36,350
Besides, I don't put up with no
trouble on my beat.

262
00:59:36,513 --> 00:59:40,426
You'll put up, and you'll shut up.
You hear nothing, and you see nothing.

263
00:59:40,593 --> 00:59:42,390
Just like you did for Bugsy.

264
00:59:42,553 --> 00:59:43,906
Shit!

265
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:48,948
Don't get upset. That makes it worse.
It can happen the first time.

266
00:59:49,113 --> 00:59:53,743
- It's them two talking out there.
- Can't you see you're ruining the mood?

267
00:59:53,913 --> 00:59:55,790
We made our deal.

268
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:59,908
- So take a walk.
- Come here, honey.

269
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:05,508
- Feel good, <i>bubeleh?</i>
- He'll never get it up.

270
01:00:06,793 --> 01:00:12,151
Relax. Okay. Calm down, calm down.

271
01:00:16,353 --> 01:00:20,790
Okay. Okay, come here.

272
01:01:37,313 --> 01:01:39,031
I'm glad the baby's better.

273
01:01:39,313 --> 01:01:43,465
- Happy <i>Pesach,</i> Deborah.
- Happy <i>Pesach,</i> Becky.

274
01:01:49,233 --> 01:01:51,588
Hurry. We're gonna be late.

275
01:01:51,753 --> 01:01:54,472
- There's Deborah.
- Sorry. Mama needed help.

276
01:01:54,633 --> 01:01:59,309
Good girl. I just locked up,
and I'm giving you the keys.

277
01:02:11,713 --> 01:02:15,626
I thought I'd just practice
my dance routines. All right?

278
01:02:15,793 --> 01:02:19,183
Make sure you don't let the <i>goyim</i> in.

279
01:02:19,873 --> 01:02:23,388
- Okay, bye.
- See you later, Debbie. Bye.

280
01:03:32,993 --> 01:03:35,268
Get down off of there, roach.

281
01:03:35,433 --> 01:03:37,105
That record's just like Ex-Lax.

282
01:03:37,273 --> 01:03:40,868
Every time I put it on,
you have to go to the bathroom.

283
01:03:57,673 --> 01:03:59,186
What are you doing?

284
01:03:59,353 --> 01:04:02,106
- Give me a drink.
- We're closed.

285
01:04:02,273 --> 01:04:06,630
Nice people don't drink on <i>Pesach.</i>
They go to the synagogue.

286
01:04:06,793 --> 01:04:08,704
So, what are you doing here?

287
01:04:08,873 --> 01:04:11,512
Somebody's got to keep an eye
on the place.

288
01:04:11,673 --> 01:04:15,746
There are a lot of thieves out there.
One could get into your house.

289
01:04:15,913 --> 01:04:18,950
Especially if you leave the door open.

290
01:04:49,913 --> 01:04:50,948
You can pray here too.

291
01:04:53,871 --> 01:04:57,546
Here or in the synagogue,
to God it's the same difference.

292
01:04:59,071 --> 01:05:01,221
Come over here and sit down.

293
01:05:32,951 --> 01:05:35,704
"My beloved is white and ruddy.

294
01:05:35,871 --> 01:05:39,341
His skin is as the most fine gold.

295
01:05:39,511 --> 01:05:43,390
His cheeks are as a bed of spices."

296
01:05:46,031 --> 01:05:49,706
Even though he hasn't washed
since last December.

297
01:05:53,831 --> 01:05:56,629
"His eyes are as the eyes
of doves.

298
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:59,385
His body is as bright ivory.

299
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:03,305
His legs are as pillars of marble."

300
01:06:05,111 --> 01:06:07,864
In pants so dirty
they stand by themselves.

301
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:12,663
"He is altogether lovable."

302
01:06:14,191 --> 01:06:16,625
But he'll always be a two-bit punk...

303
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:21,501
...so he'll never be my beloved.
What a shame.

304
01:06:51,631 --> 01:06:53,349
Somebody's there.

305
01:07:05,431 --> 01:07:07,581
There ain't nobody.

306
01:07:13,511 --> 01:07:15,263
It's Max.

307
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:17,865
So that's who it was.

308
01:07:18,511 --> 01:07:20,069
Noodles!

309
01:07:24,231 --> 01:07:26,791
Go on, run.
Your mother's calling you.

310
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:33,950
Noodles!

311
01:07:35,111 --> 01:07:37,466
Just gonna go see what he wants.

312
01:08:10,951 --> 01:08:14,023
- You been here long?
- No.

313
01:08:15,071 --> 01:08:17,221
Were you in there?

314
01:08:19,511 --> 01:08:21,627
You're one lousy kisser.

315
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:24,828
I seen you go in there
after that ball-buster.

316
01:08:24,991 --> 01:08:29,826
Here's the stuff from last night. We got
4 for the silverware, 6 for the typewriter.

317
01:08:30,031 --> 01:08:34,024
Lipschitz wouldn't cough up any more.
We gotta get somebody else.

318
01:08:36,271 --> 01:08:38,785
I came to divvy up.

319
01:08:39,231 --> 01:08:43,668
- Tomorrow, with the others.
- I also came to pick you up.

320
01:08:45,071 --> 01:08:48,950
- I can't come right now.
- The houses, the stores are all empty.

321
01:08:49,111 --> 01:08:52,899
We got our pick. You pick that.

322
01:08:53,071 --> 01:08:54,948
Yeah.

323
01:08:57,871 --> 01:09:02,183
Some partner I got. Have fun.

324
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:09,827
How's it going, boys?

325
01:09:09,991 --> 01:09:12,061
Who's that?

326
01:09:12,431 --> 01:09:14,308
Bugsy.

327
01:09:30,871 --> 01:09:34,181
I hear you guys are in business
for yourselves now.

328
01:09:34,351 --> 01:09:37,388
I hear youse are doing real good.

329
01:09:43,151 --> 01:09:46,223
Ain't you gonna introduce me
to your friend here?

330
01:09:48,591 --> 01:09:51,025
I'll introduce myself.

331
01:09:55,751 --> 01:09:57,548
Excuse the glove.

332
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:08,424
Son of a bitch!

333
01:10:53,911 --> 01:10:55,788
That's my cut.

334
01:10:56,111 --> 01:10:59,945
You don't work for me,
you don't work for no one.

335
01:11:00,111 --> 01:11:01,863
I don't like bosses.

336
01:11:02,271 --> 01:11:05,627
You was better off
you stayed in the Bronx.

337
01:11:08,751 --> 01:11:11,629
It would have been better for you too.

338
01:11:51,951 --> 01:11:55,944
- I'm gonna kill him one of these days.
- Yeah?

339
01:11:56,391 --> 01:12:00,669
Meantime it looks like he's killed us.

340
01:12:19,151 --> 01:12:21,870
Deborah, open up the door.

341
01:12:22,991 --> 01:12:25,869
Deborah, open up the door.

342
01:12:27,311 --> 01:12:28,869
Deborah.

343
01:13:09,191 --> 01:13:12,866
- That stuff, is it ready?
- We're loading it.

344
01:13:46,351 --> 01:13:50,583
- <i>Che cazzo succede</i> down here?
- Al, we got the big boys with us today.

345
01:13:50,751 --> 01:13:54,346
- They wanna work for us.
- Doing what Bugsy did. We want his job.

346
01:13:54,511 --> 01:13:55,626
Do you get that?

347
01:13:56,951 --> 01:14:00,910
We the best escorts you ever gonna get.

348
01:14:01,711 --> 01:14:05,624
<i>A fangulo a ma,</i> escort your
mother's ass out of here.

349
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:10,819
Okay. Let's go, Noodles. We'll peddle
your invention somewhere else.

350
01:14:12,511 --> 01:14:14,502
Hey, wait a minute.

351
01:14:16,271 --> 01:14:17,260
What invention?

352
01:14:17,431 --> 01:14:20,264
- You ship your stuff by the river, right?
- Sometimes.

353
01:14:20,431 --> 01:14:23,821
And when you get caught,
you throw the cases overboard.

354
01:14:23,991 --> 01:14:26,630
- You lose the whole shipment.
- So?

355
01:14:26,791 --> 01:14:29,385
For 10 percent,
we'll save it all for you.

356
01:14:29,551 --> 01:14:32,748
- What do you got, a submarine?
- We got salt.

357
01:14:33,591 --> 01:14:35,070
You got what?

358
01:14:35,231 --> 01:14:39,907
- Me and the boys are rolling salts.
- We need 3 tons of salt per shipment.

359
01:14:40,071 --> 01:14:43,461
Get the fuck out of here.
Go back to school where you belong.

360
01:14:43,911 --> 01:14:46,266
What is it with all this salt?

361
01:14:46,431 --> 01:14:50,788
Hey, hey, we got salt on our noodles.
Show 'em.

362
01:15:02,991 --> 01:15:04,709
This is full of salt.

363
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:11,184
All right, come here.

364
01:15:25,711 --> 01:15:28,271
- So?
- Keep your shirt on.

365
01:15:28,431 --> 01:15:30,945
We gotta wait for the salt
to dissolve.

366
01:16:01,831 --> 01:16:04,629
- Well?
- Hey, what's wrong?

367
01:16:10,511 --> 01:16:11,785
Hey, look.

368
01:16:12,511 --> 01:16:13,785
Wow!

369
01:16:15,911 --> 01:16:17,185
Great!

370
01:16:18,591 --> 01:16:20,980
- Look at that!
- It's great.

371
01:16:21,151 --> 01:16:22,504
- Noodles.
- Look.

372
01:16:24,111 --> 01:16:27,467
- I see 'em! What did I tell you?
- Yeah.

373
01:16:30,831 --> 01:16:32,059
Yeah!

374
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:44,828
- Hooray.
- Hooray for us!

375
01:16:48,591 --> 01:16:49,785
We did it.

376
01:16:50,911 --> 01:16:52,310
Come here, Max.

377
01:16:53,751 --> 01:16:56,902
- We did it.
- No, Max, no!

378
01:17:00,511 --> 01:17:01,705
Max.

379
01:17:03,311 --> 01:17:04,664
Max.

380
01:17:15,871 --> 01:17:17,145
Max!

381
01:17:19,631 --> 01:17:20,825
Max!

382
01:17:34,671 --> 01:17:36,901
What would you do without me?

383
01:18:39,831 --> 01:18:41,059
There.

384
01:18:44,271 --> 01:18:47,422
From here on, we establish the
shared funds of the gang.

385
01:18:47,591 --> 01:18:50,424
They belong to all of us together
and to none of us alone.

386
01:18:50,591 --> 01:18:55,745
And we solemnly swear to put in 50
percent of everything we make. Agreed?

387
01:18:55,911 --> 01:18:57,060
Agreed.

388
01:18:57,391 --> 01:18:59,063
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

389
01:19:02,111 --> 01:19:03,305
Agreed.

390
01:19:05,711 --> 01:19:07,542
I wanna take another peek.

391
01:19:26,471 --> 01:19:28,223
Announcing the departure of...

392
01:19:28,391 --> 01:19:32,862
...the Lackawanna Railroad,
Hudson Valley Express, Poughkeepsie...

393
01:19:33,031 --> 01:19:37,741
...AIbany, Utica, and Buffalo.

394
01:19:39,151 --> 01:19:40,425
All aboard.

395
01:19:44,511 --> 01:19:48,026
This goes to Fat Moe.
We don't tell him what it's for.

396
01:19:48,191 --> 01:19:51,422
And he gives it back
only when we're all together.

397
01:19:51,591 --> 01:19:52,740
Agreed?

398
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:54,985
Agreed.

399
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,064
Agreed.

400
01:20:55,311 --> 01:20:57,222
Bugsy's coming! Run!

401
01:21:46,871 --> 01:21:48,145
Noodles.

402
01:21:49,631 --> 01:21:51,622
I slipped.

403
01:23:29,991 --> 01:23:31,185
Schmuck.

404
01:25:40,671 --> 01:25:42,184
Wanna go in?

405
01:25:45,991 --> 01:25:47,310
Yeah.

406
01:25:47,751 --> 01:25:49,070
You a relative?

407
01:25:52,751 --> 01:25:53,945
An uncle.

408
01:26:06,031 --> 01:26:07,305
It's open.

409
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:14,781
"Erected to their everlasting memory
by their friend and brother...

410
01:29:14,951 --> 01:29:17,226
...David Aaronson, 1967."

411
01:31:50,551 --> 01:31:52,701
Can I take that for you, sir?

412
01:31:55,031 --> 01:31:56,987
Your limousine is waiting.

413
01:32:06,991 --> 01:32:08,265
Maxie.

414
01:32:19,751 --> 01:32:22,584
How are you, uncle?
You're looking good.

415
01:32:23,991 --> 01:32:25,709
You're looking a little better.

416
01:32:29,111 --> 01:32:32,899
Come on. Better get
you off the streets.

417
01:32:35,991 --> 01:32:39,142
- Some limousine.
- What are you talking, huh?

418
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:43,828
We own the company now.
It's a good cover. It pays off too.

419
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:47,700
My mother wrote me you was in the
body-snatching business.

420
01:32:49,951 --> 01:32:53,068
I appreciate everything you did
for my family.

421
01:32:53,271 --> 01:32:55,421
Forget it. It's your dough.

422
01:32:56,031 --> 01:32:59,262
It's all down in black and white
in the company books.

423
01:33:00,031 --> 01:33:05,264
You're the company. You and Patsy and
Cockeye. Gravediggers and partners.

424
01:33:05,431 --> 01:33:08,423
Hey, enough of this.
Business before pleasure.

425
01:33:09,231 --> 01:33:11,222
We got a rush job. Here.

426
01:33:13,991 --> 01:33:16,664
Come here. Look at this. Come here.

427
01:33:18,471 --> 01:33:22,020
Sudden death. Fucking tragedy, huh?

428
01:33:23,311 --> 01:33:26,508
- 26 years old.
- 26?

429
01:33:28,351 --> 01:33:32,264
- What a shame.
- Great stiff. She died of an overdose.

430
01:33:32,431 --> 01:33:34,342
And I'm ready for another.

431
01:33:34,511 --> 01:33:37,867
Pump the life into her.
You didn't turn pansy in there, did you?

432
01:33:41,431 --> 01:33:42,830
There you go.

433
01:33:45,671 --> 01:33:49,550
Turning over in the grave.
They do it every time.

434
01:34:29,191 --> 01:34:32,740
Don't worry. A pansy he ain't.

435
01:34:34,471 --> 01:34:36,826
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, Noodles.

436
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:39,189
Whoops. Sorry.

437
01:34:39,511 --> 01:34:41,581
Thanks. Good night.

438
01:34:42,271 --> 01:34:48,107
- Hey, you want a little pick-me-up?
- No, thanks. I've had mine.

439
01:34:48,671 --> 01:34:52,584
- Did you give her your all?
- What do you think? You bet I did.

440
01:35:16,271 --> 01:35:19,024
Wait till you see this place.

441
01:35:19,191 --> 01:35:20,590
It's over here.

442
01:35:22,791 --> 01:35:26,261
- Where we going?
- To a place that never closes.

443
01:35:27,151 --> 01:35:29,062
Whoops. Watch yourself.

444
01:35:45,831 --> 01:35:46,820
What's this?

445
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:49,380
Our place.
We got the hottest spot in town.

446
01:35:57,151 --> 01:35:59,585
This is the real Fat Moe's.

447
01:36:00,911 --> 01:36:02,788
Get rid of that rag, will you?

448
01:36:04,031 --> 01:36:06,340
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

449
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:08,741
- You like it?
- Beautiful. Beautiful.

450
01:36:23,551 --> 01:36:25,269
Hey, give me that.

451
01:36:30,311 --> 01:36:33,383
- Noodles. Look who's here.
- Patsy, look.

452
01:36:33,551 --> 01:36:37,021
Come here, son of a bitch.
Come here! Come here!

453
01:36:38,311 --> 01:36:40,506
- You look fantastic.
- Wait a minute.

454
01:36:40,671 --> 01:36:41,990
How you doing?

455
01:36:44,751 --> 01:36:46,867
- Look how big you got.
- Me?

456
01:36:47,031 --> 01:36:48,987
Noodles. Oh, God.

457
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:52,430
- Noodles!
- Number three coming through.

458
01:36:57,751 --> 01:37:00,106
Let's have a toast, for chrissakes!

459
01:37:00,271 --> 01:37:02,785
- You look like shit.
- I just got out of prison.

460
01:37:02,951 --> 01:37:06,023
- Nice guy.
- Hey, Noodles, get a load of this.

461
01:37:09,031 --> 01:37:10,908
Hey, scotch heating.

462
01:37:11,071 --> 01:37:12,982
Yeah, a buck a cup.

463
01:37:14,071 --> 01:37:15,470
- A buck a cup?
- Yeah.

464
01:37:15,631 --> 01:37:17,747
- How much it cost us?
- Costing us?

465
01:37:17,911 --> 01:37:20,186
A dime, including overhead.

466
01:37:20,391 --> 01:37:23,588
- Hey, Noodles.
- Fat Moe.

467
01:37:29,351 --> 01:37:30,830
You look terrific.

468
01:37:33,551 --> 01:37:38,341
- Look like you lost an ounce or two.
- You think I'm gonna lose hemorrhoids.

469
01:37:38,591 --> 01:37:40,946
Can't recognize him without an apron.

470
01:37:41,111 --> 01:37:42,942
<i>- L 'Chaim.</i>
<i>- L 'Chaim.</i>

471
01:37:44,231 --> 01:37:45,425
Welcome home.

472
01:37:49,231 --> 01:37:53,144
What kind of maître d' are you?
You don't even show a guy around.

473
01:37:53,311 --> 01:37:54,903
- Yeah.
- What's with you?

474
01:37:55,071 --> 01:37:58,825
- I didn't know. I'm sorry.
- You're some bunch of <i>shtunks.</i>

475
01:37:58,991 --> 01:38:01,983
- You don't come up and get me.
- He's the <i>shtunk.</i>

476
01:38:02,151 --> 01:38:07,145
- He said you weren't out till Monday.
- You get him the next time he gets out.

477
01:38:08,031 --> 01:38:09,862
God forbid. God forbid.

478
01:38:27,071 --> 01:38:30,222
Come on, let's see if you can
guess who it is.

479
01:38:35,151 --> 01:38:39,269
Charlotte russe. With a little too
much whipped cream.

480
01:38:40,551 --> 01:38:41,984
Peggy.

481
01:38:46,031 --> 01:38:50,104
Hey, you watch it, now.
And my prices, they've gone up.

482
01:38:50,271 --> 01:38:55,140
I work in a high-class joint now.
And I get paid by the pound.

483
01:38:55,711 --> 01:38:59,863
My Peggy, she's worth every penny
of it too, my red-hot mama.

484
01:39:01,711 --> 01:39:03,429
Come on, come on.

485
01:39:05,791 --> 01:39:07,190
Timber!

486
01:39:08,271 --> 01:39:12,184
You've seen your old pals,
now I want you to meet some new ones.

487
01:39:12,351 --> 01:39:16,981
- I'll see you later.
- You gonna lay here all night or what?

488
01:39:25,951 --> 01:39:29,739
Cockeye wanted to play with the band.
I'm serious.

489
01:39:36,311 --> 01:39:37,539
Come on.

490
01:40:03,551 --> 01:40:06,861
- Aren't you going to say hello?
- Hello.

491
01:40:25,951 --> 01:40:29,739
- Your brother's a real friend.
- He's a romantic.

492
01:40:40,671 --> 01:40:44,380
- Max tell you I was getting out today?
- Max? No.

493
01:40:45,111 --> 01:40:49,502
- You remembered yourself?
- No, Moe. It's always Moe.

494
01:40:54,151 --> 01:40:55,425
Yeah.

495
01:41:04,111 --> 01:41:06,147
You weren't counting the days?

496
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:11,544
Of course I was. 4344, 4343.

497
01:41:11,711 --> 01:41:13,986
I lost track at 3000.

498
01:41:14,151 --> 01:41:17,780
- That wasn't my choice.
- Yes, it was. It still is.

499
01:41:20,551 --> 01:41:23,509
Did you come here to
welcome me back at least?

500
01:41:23,671 --> 01:41:27,744
I still live here. I was on my way out.
Moe said I should say hello.

501
01:41:29,151 --> 01:41:32,860
I hope Moe didn't have to
bend your arm or anything.

502
01:41:35,151 --> 01:41:36,379
No.

503
01:41:37,991 --> 01:41:39,947
Welcome back, Noodles.

504
01:41:42,991 --> 01:41:44,265
Hey, Noodles.

505
01:41:51,111 --> 01:41:52,590
You dancing?

506
01:41:53,191 --> 01:41:55,751
Every night at the Palace Theatre.

507
01:41:56,591 --> 01:42:01,665
I've made some progress since I danced
here among the brooms and the empties.

508
01:42:02,871 --> 01:42:06,910
You can come spy on me if you like.
If you have time.

509
01:42:08,191 --> 01:42:09,670
Every night.

510
01:42:25,351 --> 01:42:26,750
Noodles.

511
01:42:30,191 --> 01:42:33,661
Go on, Noodles,
your mother's calling you.

512
01:42:41,631 --> 01:42:44,145
It's good to see you again, Noodles.

513
01:42:56,551 --> 01:42:57,950
My pleasure.

514
01:43:06,511 --> 01:43:09,787
- Did you get the wine?
- Dago Red. The best.

515
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:18,544
How you doing?

516
01:43:25,311 --> 01:43:28,860
There they are.
The four horsemen of the apocalypse.

517
01:43:31,391 --> 01:43:34,428
Did you see that movie, Joe?
It's a good movie.

518
01:43:34,591 --> 01:43:37,230
- Max, how are you?
- Good to see you.

519
01:43:38,671 --> 01:43:41,868
- This must be Noodles.
- Noodles, say hello to Mr. Monaldi.

520
01:43:42,031 --> 01:43:44,067
- Hi, how are you?
- All right.

521
01:43:44,231 --> 01:43:48,383
Nice to meet you. You don't have
to call me Mr. Monaldi.

522
01:43:48,551 --> 01:43:52,783
I like my friends and people I respect
to call me Frankie.

523
01:43:53,591 --> 01:43:57,140
Come on, sit down.
Get some chairs and some glasses.

524
01:44:00,871 --> 01:44:04,227
Sit down, relax. You're home now.

525
01:44:13,711 --> 01:44:16,350
This is my very dear friend Joe.

526
01:44:16,511 --> 01:44:19,662
He came from Detroit to ask me
to do him a favor.

527
01:44:20,311 --> 01:44:22,108
And I wanna do it for him.

528
01:44:23,391 --> 01:44:28,863
I don't have to tell you who Joe is,
how far he got, or how far he'll get.

529
01:44:29,391 --> 01:44:32,940
He's not only my dear friend,
he's my brother.

530
01:44:33,111 --> 01:44:36,786
I'll tell you the truth.
Even a Jew can't eat this shit.

531
01:44:37,591 --> 01:44:40,185
I mean, the mustard doesn't even help.

532
01:44:49,751 --> 01:44:52,219
These guys with you?

533
01:44:52,751 --> 01:44:55,345
I told you these fellas are with me.

534
01:44:55,831 --> 01:44:58,584
You could trust them.
You're in good hands.

535
01:44:58,991 --> 01:45:01,744
Just tell them
what you want them to do.

536
01:45:03,431 --> 01:45:07,583
Move some diamonds from Detroit.
Kid stuff.

537
01:45:12,671 --> 01:45:14,502
Why us then?

538
01:45:15,111 --> 01:45:18,945
If it's kid stuff, why not have
the kids from Detroit do it?

539
01:45:21,511 --> 01:45:26,949
Excuse me, Noodles. He means that
it's something that's very simple.

540
01:45:27,111 --> 01:45:30,387
But he needs kids
from outside to handle it.

541
01:45:30,551 --> 01:45:34,988
He just found out they're moving these
diamonds to Holland in a few days.

542
01:45:35,151 --> 01:45:37,711
So it's something came up right away.

543
01:45:38,391 --> 01:45:40,063
You understand?

544
01:45:46,471 --> 01:45:47,790
Hey, Joe.

545
01:45:48,951 --> 01:45:54,742
Tell these guys the story about
the pussy being insured. What is it?

546
01:45:57,031 --> 01:46:00,307
Tell these guys how you
stumbled on this whole thing.

547
01:46:00,471 --> 01:46:02,462
- Tell them the story.
- Come on.

548
01:46:02,631 --> 01:46:06,226
Pussy insurance. The insurance pussies.
Tell them that story.

549
01:46:06,391 --> 01:46:12,023
Life is stranger than shit, that's
all. It's a pisser. No big story.

550
01:46:12,191 --> 01:46:15,581
I got this insurance agent,
this Jew kid named David.

551
01:46:15,751 --> 01:46:20,222
He conned me into every policy in
the world. Every policy, name it.

552
01:46:20,391 --> 01:46:23,986
Dogs, house, wife, life, anything.

553
01:46:24,151 --> 01:46:27,860
I'm drinking with the boys one night,
he comes in with his wife...

554
01:46:28,031 --> 01:46:31,262
...a brunette with a nice ass
who works for a jeweler.

555
01:46:31,431 --> 01:46:34,150
And he's still on the hustle, this guy.

556
01:46:35,271 --> 01:46:37,865
So I wink at the guys,
I say, " Look...

557
01:46:39,511 --> 01:46:43,629
...the most serious policy,
you don't have me covered for."

558
01:46:43,791 --> 01:46:47,670
He goes, "What's that, Joe?"
"Cock insurance."

559
01:46:47,831 --> 01:46:52,302
"You make me a policy that
when it don't work, I get a payment...

560
01:46:52,471 --> 01:46:54,541
...I'll write out a check now."

561
01:46:56,751 --> 01:47:02,189
He thinks, and he says, " I don't know
if the actuality gauges govern this...

562
01:47:02,351 --> 01:47:04,421
...but we can make a policy.

563
01:47:04,591 --> 01:47:07,663
But you gotta guarantee you're
in good health now."

564
01:47:07,831 --> 01:47:12,382
I says, " Look, leave her with me.
Come back and see if it stands up.

565
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:15,349
If it stands up,
you know I'm in good health."

566
01:47:15,511 --> 01:47:17,706
The jerk leaves her. I screw her.

567
01:47:17,871 --> 01:47:22,626
Not only that, she likes it. And she
tells me when her boss, the jeweler...

568
01:47:22,791 --> 01:47:24,747
...is shipping stones to Holland...

569
01:47:24,911 --> 01:47:29,029
...where he keeps his stash
in a drawer in the safe. Everything.

570
01:47:29,191 --> 01:47:32,388
Can't ask for more, right?
Except, one better.

571
01:47:32,551 --> 01:47:36,544
I never paid the first premium
on the new cock policy.

572
01:47:49,591 --> 01:47:51,024
Cock insurance.

573
01:47:56,511 --> 01:48:00,629
Life is funnier than shit.

574
01:48:01,031 --> 01:48:02,180
But...

575
01:48:05,831 --> 01:48:08,391
...be easy with the girl.

576
01:48:11,591 --> 01:48:13,900
I mean that. Be easy with the girl.

577
01:48:21,631 --> 01:48:23,064
Oh, my God!

578
01:48:29,351 --> 01:48:30,466
Open it!

579
01:48:30,631 --> 01:48:32,781
Who's gotten in?

580
01:48:40,591 --> 01:48:42,422
Had to go and be a hero, huh?

581
01:48:48,551 --> 01:48:49,950
- Open it.
- No.

582
01:48:50,111 --> 01:48:53,023
- Open it!
- No, don't hurt him!

583
01:48:53,191 --> 01:48:56,024
- Don't hurt him!
- Get this bitch out of here.

584
01:48:56,191 --> 01:48:59,024
You animal! You asshole!

585
01:48:59,951 --> 01:49:02,260
- Come on, hit me.
- What do you mean?

586
01:49:02,431 --> 01:49:04,069
- Hit me.
- What, are you crazy?

587
01:49:04,231 --> 01:49:07,382
- Straighten up and fly right.
- I'm all right.

588
01:49:07,551 --> 01:49:10,349
Let me make it look real.
Make it look real.

589
01:49:10,511 --> 01:49:13,025
- Knock it off.
- I'm all right. Let go.

590
01:49:13,191 --> 01:49:15,546
- Come on, cut the act.
- Hit me!

591
01:49:15,711 --> 01:49:19,340
She said hit her.
Go ahead, rap her in the mouth.

592
01:49:19,511 --> 01:49:22,264
- Hit me!
- I'll hit you! You bitch!

593
01:49:24,991 --> 01:49:27,300
- You animal!
- Put a cork in her.

594
01:49:32,191 --> 01:49:33,260
No.

595
01:49:33,431 --> 01:49:35,422
No. Don't.

596
01:49:35,591 --> 01:49:38,151
Don't. No!

597
01:49:38,311 --> 01:49:42,429
No! You dirty bastards!

598
01:49:48,151 --> 01:49:49,982
Bastards!

599
01:49:56,391 --> 01:49:58,143
Try the secret compartment.

600
01:50:04,391 --> 01:50:06,143
Attaboy.

601
01:50:15,431 --> 01:50:16,705
Thanks.

602
01:50:39,591 --> 01:50:41,741
Nice matzo balls.

603
01:50:47,951 --> 01:50:50,385
Beautiful. Look at that.

604
01:50:52,071 --> 01:50:54,301
Okay, better wrap them up.

605
01:51:03,031 --> 01:51:05,340
We're going. You coming?

606
01:51:08,031 --> 01:51:09,464
Coming.

607
01:51:54,951 --> 01:51:58,148
- Morning.
- You get the stones?

608
01:52:18,311 --> 01:52:19,790
Pay him.

609
01:52:43,551 --> 01:52:47,908
- Any trouble?
- No trouble. Kid stuff.

610
01:55:01,635 --> 01:55:03,193
You okay?

611
01:55:39,635 --> 01:55:43,389
- How come you didn't tell me?
- Being inside can change you.

612
01:55:43,555 --> 01:55:46,865
I'd already made the deal with Frankie
to get rid of Joe.

613
01:55:47,035 --> 01:55:50,391
With Frankie Monaldi
you don't say, "yes" and then, "no."

614
01:55:50,555 --> 01:55:52,625
You're right.
I would have said, no.

615
01:55:52,795 --> 01:55:54,706
Frankie is as big as they come.

616
01:55:54,875 --> 01:55:56,831
He's got the combination
in his hand.

617
01:55:56,995 --> 01:55:59,714
If we're not careful,
he'll have us in his hand.

618
01:55:59,875 --> 01:56:02,025
You don't get nowhere alone.

619
01:56:02,555 --> 01:56:04,785
I thought you didn't like bosses.

620
01:56:04,955 --> 01:56:07,992
It sounded like a good idea then.
It still is.

621
01:56:08,155 --> 01:56:09,270
Think about it.

622
01:56:09,435 --> 01:56:13,792
They're gonna ask us to come in
with them. There's a lot in it for us.

623
01:56:16,115 --> 01:56:20,427
Today they asked us to get rid of Joe.
Tomorrow they ask me to get rid of you.

624
01:56:20,595 --> 01:56:23,826
Is that okay with you?
'Cause it's not okay with me.

625
01:56:26,715 --> 01:56:28,467
All right.

626
01:56:29,595 --> 01:56:32,063
Let's just forget about it.

627
01:56:44,395 --> 01:56:45,874
Wanna go for a swim?

628
01:56:48,155 --> 01:56:50,464
Yeah, let's go for a swim.

629
01:57:01,155 --> 01:57:03,066
All right, what are you doing?

630
01:57:03,235 --> 01:57:06,511
Hey, Noodles.
Don't fuck around, Noodles.

631
01:57:09,475 --> 01:57:11,784
- Noodles, what are you doing?
- Hey!

632
01:57:11,955 --> 01:57:14,105
You crazy?

633
01:57:16,795 --> 01:57:18,626
Shit.

634
01:57:24,955 --> 01:57:28,470
Asshole!
Can't believe you did this!

635
01:57:45,275 --> 01:57:48,824
<i>District Attorney James Lister</i>
<i>was killed in an explosion of a car...</i>

636
01:57:48,995 --> 01:57:54,865
<i>...belonging to Secretary of Commerce</i>
<i>Bailey as he left the secretary's estate.</i>

637
01:57:55,035 --> 01:57:58,311
<i>Mr. Lister, killed in</i>
<i>the blast, was scheduled to testify...</i>

638
01:57:58,475 --> 01:58:01,512
<i>...in Washington on Thursday</i>
<i>before a Senate committee.</i>

639
01:58:01,675 --> 01:58:05,509
<i>A committee investigating what has</i>
<i>been called "The Bailey Scandal."</i>

640
01:58:05,675 --> 01:58:08,906
<i>A team of detectives</i>
<i>has been assigned to the case.</i>

641
01:58:09,075 --> 01:58:13,705
<i>Secretary Bailey was not available</i>
<i>for any statement at this time.</i>

642
01:58:14,555 --> 01:58:15,624
Did you know them?

643
01:58:15,795 --> 01:58:18,992
<i>- Offices of his legal advisor,</i>
<i>Irving Gold...</i>

644
01:58:19,155 --> 01:58:21,589
<i>...in hopes of getting some comment.</i>

645
01:58:21,755 --> 01:58:25,987
<i>Mr. Gold, you're aware</i>
<i>that District Attorney Lister...</i>

646
01:58:26,155 --> 01:58:29,909
<i>...is the second witness in the Bailey</i>
<i>Scandal to meet a sudden end.</i>

647
01:58:30,075 --> 01:58:33,431
<i>The first was Thomas Finney,</i>
<i>undersecretary of commerce...</i>

648
01:58:33,595 --> 01:58:37,634
<i>...who fell to his death from his</i>
<i>15th-floor office a month ago.</i>

649
01:58:37,795 --> 01:58:39,353
<i>Is there a connection...?</i>

650
01:58:39,515 --> 01:58:43,349
Take the money and run, Noodles.
What's keeping you here?

651
01:58:44,275 --> 01:58:46,994
<i>The only remaining witness</i>
<i>is the man who...</i>

652
01:58:47,155 --> 01:58:52,070
<i>...rightly or wrongly has given his</i>
<i>name to this affair, Secretary Bailey.</i>

653
01:58:52,235 --> 01:58:54,032
Curious.

654
01:58:55,035 --> 01:58:56,946
<i>The secretary has no worries.</i>

655
01:58:57,115 --> 01:59:01,745
<i>If he has no worries, why has he</i>
<i>retreated to his place on Long Island?</i>

656
01:59:01,915 --> 01:59:04,827
<i>He's preparing his attack</i>
<i>on the questions...</i>

657
01:59:04,995 --> 01:59:07,429
<i>...he will be asked by the committee.</i>

658
01:59:07,595 --> 01:59:10,029
<i>I'd call them accusations</i>
<i>more than questions.</i>

659
01:59:10,195 --> 01:59:12,755
<i>- He has no worries.</i>
<i>- The public does.</i>

660
01:59:12,915 --> 01:59:17,272
<i>Particularly, in view of the rumors</i>
<i>about rigged contracts, bribery...</i>

661
01:59:17,435 --> 01:59:21,713
<i>...the international Mafia. Especially</i>
<i>those dealing with the illegal use...</i>

662
01:59:21,875 --> 01:59:24,628
<i>...of the Transport union</i>
<i>pension funds.</i>

663
01:59:24,795 --> 01:59:27,025
<i>Could you tell us anything about that?</i>

664
01:59:27,195 --> 01:59:32,792
<i>Gentlemen, I deny all of these rumors</i>
<i>and allegations against my organization.</i>

665
01:59:32,955 --> 01:59:37,233
<i>Our hands have always been</i>
<i>and will continue to remain clean.</i>

666
01:59:37,395 --> 01:59:42,708
<i>In my entire life, I've fought to keep</i>
<i>the American labor movement clear...</i>

667
01:59:42,875 --> 01:59:43,864
Him, I know.

668
01:59:44,035 --> 01:59:46,674
<i>- Forced speculation,</i>
<i>criminal elements...</i>

669
01:59:48,315 --> 01:59:51,512
<i>...or corrupt politicians.</i>
<i>If any mistakes have...</i>

670
01:59:51,675 --> 01:59:54,667
He's still giving out
the same old bullshit.

671
01:59:54,835 --> 02:00:00,910
<i>If any guilt at all exists</i>
<i>in this situation, it lies elsewhere.</i>

672
02:00:38,475 --> 02:00:42,548
What's this I've been reading
about you in the newspapers?

673
02:00:44,835 --> 02:00:49,192
Inflammatory words from a union boss?

674
02:00:53,395 --> 02:00:58,423
You still won't come and stop
the workers or the social movement.

675
02:00:58,955 --> 02:01:02,072
Listen to me, you socialist asshole!

676
02:01:02,235 --> 02:01:07,355
We don't give a good fart about the
socialist workers and their movements.

677
02:01:07,515 --> 02:01:12,305
We want you out of the factory so we
can get the furnaces working again.

678
02:01:12,475 --> 02:01:15,353
This is the last offer
you're gonna get.

679
02:01:15,515 --> 02:01:18,427
You want to sign it or what?

680
02:01:24,075 --> 02:01:27,226
Tell your bosses they can
wipe their ass with it.

681
02:01:33,355 --> 02:01:34,629
Fill her up.

682
02:01:58,915 --> 02:02:00,746
This is my last...

683
02:02:07,235 --> 02:02:10,227
Hold it, boys. Don't shoot.

684
02:02:11,395 --> 02:02:13,590
It's me, Crowning.

685
02:02:25,995 --> 02:02:28,634
- Crowning.
- Yeah.

686
02:02:28,795 --> 02:02:30,387
That'll do, boys.

687
02:02:30,555 --> 02:02:32,307
What'll do?

688
02:02:32,475 --> 02:02:35,626
We almost got the kid
where we want him.

689
02:02:39,315 --> 02:02:42,273
And we got the boss where we want him.

690
02:02:42,435 --> 02:02:43,948
Easy.

691
02:02:44,955 --> 02:02:46,866
Easy.

692
02:02:50,075 --> 02:02:52,305
Put 'em down.

693
02:02:53,035 --> 02:02:55,503
Put your guns away, boys.

694
02:03:04,915 --> 02:03:06,906
Just swapping prisoners.

695
02:03:07,515 --> 02:03:10,029
Fair trade, huh, chickenhead?

696
02:03:17,115 --> 02:03:20,152
Union boy over here for Mr. Boss Man.

697
02:03:20,315 --> 02:03:22,749
Well, look who's here.

698
02:03:23,475 --> 02:03:26,114
Fat Moe's boneyard boys.

699
02:03:26,275 --> 02:03:28,266
Which reminds me.

700
02:03:28,675 --> 02:03:32,270
How's that cancer in your gut
coming along, Chicken Joe?

701
02:03:34,275 --> 02:03:37,984
- Untie him.
- I don't take orders from you.

702
02:03:38,155 --> 02:03:41,192
We're not asking you to take orders.
We're telling you.

703
02:03:41,355 --> 02:03:43,425
Now go ahead, untie him.

704
02:03:43,595 --> 02:03:45,506
Untie him.

705
02:03:50,195 --> 02:03:51,264
Untie him.

706
02:04:21,275 --> 02:04:23,186
Who are you?

707
02:04:24,155 --> 02:04:25,144
Who's paying you?

708
02:04:26,115 --> 02:04:29,073
I think this is gonna piss you off, Mac.

709
02:04:29,235 --> 02:04:32,625
I think it's those dirty
politician friends of yours.

710
02:04:32,795 --> 02:04:37,232
Yeah? Well, you crawl back and tell
'em we don't want you in with us.

711
02:04:37,395 --> 02:04:41,149
Our fight's got nothing to do with
liquor and prostitution and dope.

712
02:04:41,315 --> 02:04:44,273
Well, you'd better
get used to the idea, pal.

713
02:04:44,435 --> 02:04:46,391
This country is still growing up.

714
02:04:46,555 --> 02:04:50,309
Certain diseases it's better
to have when you're still young.

715
02:04:52,035 --> 02:04:56,631
You boys ain't a mild case
of the measles. You're the plague.

716
02:04:56,795 --> 02:04:58,751
Bastards like him are immune.

717
02:04:58,915 --> 02:05:02,066
That's the difference
between us and them!

718
02:05:03,835 --> 02:05:05,587
Take it easy.

719
02:05:05,755 --> 02:05:07,666
The difference is,
they'll always win.

720
02:05:07,835 --> 02:05:10,303
And you'll keep
getting it up the ass.

721
02:05:10,475 --> 02:05:12,352
Sooner than you think.

722
02:05:28,955 --> 02:05:32,994
Chief Aiello, moving policemen into
the factory came as a surprise.

723
02:05:33,155 --> 02:05:35,749
The press, the unions,
especially the strikers.

724
02:05:35,915 --> 02:05:38,383
What did you want,
a declaration of war?

725
02:05:38,555 --> 02:05:40,227
Ours was a peaceable operation.

726
02:05:40,395 --> 02:05:42,670
Wasn't that contrary
to new union laws?

727
02:05:42,835 --> 02:05:44,951
I'm chief of police,
not chief of people.

728
02:05:45,115 --> 02:05:47,345
Was there any violence to justify...?

729
02:05:47,515 --> 02:05:51,030
My motto is:
"Prevention, not repression."

730
02:05:51,195 --> 02:05:53,186
You let scabs move in and work.

731
02:05:53,355 --> 02:05:57,064
Young lady, you wanna talk to me,
call them "unemployed workers."

732
02:05:57,235 --> 02:06:02,070
With your permission, I'll take these
flowers to my missis before they wilt.

733
02:06:02,715 --> 02:06:07,584
Or maybe you heard.
I'm the father of a baby boy.

734
02:06:11,195 --> 02:06:15,473
We heard he's the youngest stockholder
in that factory you occupied.

735
02:06:19,995 --> 02:06:21,872
What'd you mean by that?

736
02:06:22,035 --> 02:06:26,392
They say management expressed their
thanks with a present for the baby.

737
02:06:29,315 --> 02:06:31,829
You know,
slander is a serious offense.

738
02:06:31,995 --> 02:06:34,145
Especially from a hack reporter.

739
02:06:34,635 --> 02:06:37,274
You wanna find out how serious?

740
02:06:39,315 --> 02:06:44,105
But since this is my first boy
after four girls...

741
02:06:44,275 --> 02:06:46,709
...I'll declare amnesty.

742
02:06:48,315 --> 02:06:50,545
Behave yourself.

743
02:06:51,875 --> 02:06:53,706
Go.

744
02:08:59,555 --> 02:09:01,625
Thank you.

745
02:09:02,595 --> 02:09:04,108
He's eating?

746
02:09:04,275 --> 02:09:07,551
- For five.
- For five? Well, why not.

747
02:09:07,715 --> 02:09:10,388
You could feed an army
with these milk plants.

748
02:09:10,555 --> 02:09:12,944
We could open up a dairy.

749
02:09:15,075 --> 02:09:18,112
Oh, hey. <i>Che bella.</i>

750
02:09:18,275 --> 02:09:23,827
Who loves you? Who loves you?
I love you.

751
02:09:23,995 --> 02:09:27,670
And I love you.
And I love you.

752
02:09:27,835 --> 02:09:29,393
Lucy!

753
02:09:29,555 --> 02:09:32,388
Don't you have
to feed him at 6:00?

754
02:09:32,555 --> 02:09:34,193
Come in.

755
02:09:35,835 --> 02:09:39,271
- Oh, here he is now.
- That's my son.

756
02:09:39,435 --> 02:09:41,426
That's my son.

757
02:09:45,315 --> 02:09:50,708
That's my son! That's my son!

758
02:09:50,875 --> 02:09:53,867
Jesus Christ, they change fast.

759
02:09:54,035 --> 02:09:56,595
Yeah, but he looks like my old man.

760
02:09:56,755 --> 02:09:58,552
Yeah, yeah, look, same eyes.

761
02:09:58,715 --> 02:10:00,990
And look, the same devilish pride.

762
02:10:01,155 --> 02:10:03,908
Hey. Hey, hey.

763
02:10:04,075 --> 02:10:05,554
Did you see his dickey?

764
02:10:05,715 --> 02:10:06,864
- Vincent.
- What?

765
02:10:07,755 --> 02:10:09,905
- The girls.
- The girls!

766
02:10:10,075 --> 02:10:15,752
Sooner or later you have to learn that
after me, the boss in the house is him.

767
02:10:15,915 --> 02:10:17,633
He's got balls like his papa.

768
02:10:17,795 --> 02:10:18,989
- Hey!
- Let me have him.

769
02:10:19,155 --> 02:10:24,229
No, no, no.
I'll do this. I'll do this, huh.

770
02:10:24,395 --> 02:10:27,626
Hey. No, no, no.

771
02:10:27,795 --> 02:10:30,184
Look. Hey, hey.

772
02:10:34,195 --> 02:10:35,469
Let Papa change you.

773
02:10:35,635 --> 02:10:37,751
Come on,
everything will be swell.

774
02:10:37,915 --> 02:10:42,591
Come on, come on, come on.

775
02:10:43,755 --> 02:10:45,666
What the fuck is this?

776
02:10:45,835 --> 02:10:48,827
What is this? Huh? What's that?

777
02:10:51,675 --> 02:10:53,825
- Look!
- It's the right number.

778
02:10:53,995 --> 02:10:57,192
The right number?
I'll break your goddamn neck!

779
02:10:57,355 --> 02:11:00,267
Find my son,
or I'll burn down this building.

780
02:11:00,435 --> 02:11:02,266
Hello!

781
02:11:02,435 --> 02:11:03,424
Hello.

782
02:11:03,595 --> 02:11:04,789
Would you shut up?

783
02:11:04,955 --> 02:11:09,107
No, hey, no. Wait, wait.
I'm not talking to you.

784
02:11:09,275 --> 02:11:11,391
Well, who's this?

785
02:11:11,555 --> 02:11:13,864
Never mind...
To who am I talking?

786
02:11:14,035 --> 02:11:16,708
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>
<i>My son, where is he?</i>

787
02:11:16,875 --> 02:11:20,754
Where do you think? He's in the
maternity ward. He never left.

788
02:11:20,915 --> 02:11:24,112
He got restless, so he wanted
to change his bed.

789
02:11:24,275 --> 02:11:27,824
The other kids got the same idea,
so they wanted to change their beds.

790
02:11:27,995 --> 02:11:31,624
You got 30, 40 screaming babies
jumping from one bed to another...

791
02:11:31,795 --> 02:11:35,071
...switching tags, so now we
do have a real problem.

792
02:11:35,235 --> 02:11:39,513
<i>Piece of shit whoever you are!</i>
<i>What the fuck?! I want my son!</i>

793
02:11:39,675 --> 02:11:43,748
Luckily, we were there to see
that everything was under control.

794
02:11:43,915 --> 02:11:46,145
If you want, we can
put everything back.

795
02:11:46,315 --> 02:11:49,466
- Except you gotta meet us halfway.
<i>- Tell me!</i>

796
02:11:49,635 --> 02:11:52,308
Why do you give a fuck
who wins the strike?

797
02:11:52,475 --> 02:11:55,069
<i>That's got nothing to do with me!</i>
<i>What did I do?</i>

798
02:11:55,235 --> 02:11:57,510
First of all, you let the scabs in.

799
02:11:57,675 --> 02:12:00,951
Second, you've got the cops in there
protecting them.

800
02:12:01,115 --> 02:12:03,470
<i>- I'm a cop!</i>
- All right, shut the fuck up!

801
02:12:03,635 --> 02:12:05,546
Now listen very carefully.

802
02:12:05,715 --> 02:12:09,549
Call off your dogs and let the strikers
work it out with the bosses.

803
02:12:09,715 --> 02:12:10,704
<i>I want my son!</i>

804
02:12:10,875 --> 02:12:13,548
Do that and we'll give
you the kid's number.

805
02:12:13,715 --> 02:12:16,707
If you don't,
look for your kid yourself.

806
02:12:16,875 --> 02:12:19,025
- So, what is it gonna be?
<i>- Okay.</i>

807
02:12:19,195 --> 02:12:21,993
<i>- I'll call my men off today.</i>
- Attaboy.

808
02:12:22,155 --> 02:12:25,192
You know, for a rotten
bastard son of a bitch...

809
02:12:25,355 --> 02:12:27,994
...you're not as stupid as I thought.

810
02:12:28,795 --> 02:12:31,229
- We'll be in touch.
<i>- When will you call?</i>

811
02:12:31,395 --> 02:12:35,593
Don't worry, don't worry.
We'll be in touch with you. Bye.

812
02:12:39,395 --> 02:12:42,068
- So?
- We got a deal.

813
02:12:45,835 --> 02:12:47,985
- To a very smooth talker.
- Yeah.

814
02:12:48,155 --> 02:12:50,669
- <i>Mazel.</i>
- At least.

815
02:12:58,195 --> 02:13:00,151
Where's that switch list?

816
02:13:00,315 --> 02:13:02,624
- The switch list?
- Yeah.

817
02:13:03,915 --> 02:13:05,553
- I can't find it.
- What?

818
02:13:05,715 --> 02:13:07,706
I can't find it.

819
02:13:08,635 --> 02:13:11,547
- What'd you do with it?
- I think I dumped it.

820
02:13:11,715 --> 02:13:13,228
What a <i>yutz.</i>

821
02:13:13,395 --> 02:13:15,465
- Oh, Pat.
- Wait a minute, listen.

822
02:13:15,635 --> 02:13:18,354
Listen, Noodles,
Noodles, wait. I remember.

823
02:13:18,515 --> 02:13:22,269
The boys' numbers was odd...
Even, and the girls' was odd.

824
02:13:22,435 --> 02:13:24,471
- It's simple.
- You took good stock.

825
02:13:24,635 --> 02:13:26,830
Hey, let's give him an even number.

826
02:13:26,995 --> 02:13:29,190
Eight. Let's pick an eight.

827
02:13:29,435 --> 02:13:30,504
Eight.

828
02:13:33,275 --> 02:13:38,429
- Yeah, it's a good number.
- Wait. What about the other <i>pischers?</i>

829
02:13:38,595 --> 02:13:40,711
We're better than fate.

830
02:13:40,875 --> 02:13:44,709
We give some the good life,
give it to others up the ass.

831
02:13:46,555 --> 02:13:49,865
All right, boys, let's settle up.
It's Saturday.

832
02:13:50,035 --> 02:13:53,266
Settle-shmettle,
I'm gonna take mine out in trade.

833
02:13:53,435 --> 02:13:54,663
You're such a nudge.

834
02:13:56,275 --> 02:14:00,268
You know what? You know, I wish
I was switched when I was a kid.

835
02:14:00,435 --> 02:14:02,710
What makes you think you weren't?

836
02:14:17,275 --> 02:14:19,505
I don't believe it.

837
02:14:20,155 --> 02:14:23,864
Hey, you guys, come here.
Take a look at who's over here.

838
02:14:24,035 --> 02:14:26,230
- That suit you, Peg?
- Fine, Max.

839
02:14:26,395 --> 02:14:28,829
- What've you got?
- Over there.

840
02:14:31,195 --> 02:14:33,026
Well, what...?

841
02:14:38,075 --> 02:14:42,068
Holy shit! Noodles! Noodles!
Come here, come here.

842
02:14:42,235 --> 02:14:43,827
Look.

843
02:14:45,755 --> 02:14:48,064
The blond by the piano.

844
02:14:51,595 --> 02:14:53,426
- Who's that?
- Who is that?

845
02:14:53,595 --> 02:14:56,871
You and this broad were
practically engaged at one point.

846
02:14:57,875 --> 02:15:01,868
Oh, beat me. Oh, I love it.

847
02:15:02,035 --> 02:15:04,424
- Who was it? The Detroit cock-squasher?
- Yeah.

848
02:15:04,595 --> 02:15:06,870
- Peggy.
- That's not her. She looks different.

849
02:15:07,035 --> 02:15:10,232
You know that platinum blond.
She's by the table.

850
02:15:10,395 --> 02:15:12,704
See her? Call her in, will you?

851
02:15:19,075 --> 02:15:20,474
- Carol.
- Carol, whatever.

852
02:15:20,635 --> 02:15:24,469
Just tell her there's a bunch
of her old friends here.

853
02:15:26,115 --> 02:15:27,628
Carol.

854
02:15:27,795 --> 02:15:29,592
Carol!

855
02:15:34,395 --> 02:15:36,670
Noodles, come here.

856
02:15:39,755 --> 02:15:43,031
- Somebody here wants to see you.
- Who?

857
02:15:43,835 --> 02:15:45,791
You know these guys?

858
02:15:47,715 --> 02:15:49,512
No.

859
02:15:50,875 --> 02:15:53,230
I don't think so.

860
02:15:56,915 --> 02:15:58,348
No.

861
02:15:58,515 --> 02:16:02,144
No. I'd remember a bunch
of good-Iookers like these.

862
02:16:18,955 --> 02:16:22,470
Oh, well, how
could I forget.

863
02:16:28,475 --> 02:16:30,750
There was...

864
02:16:30,915 --> 02:16:36,308
There was only one of you
I got to know personally, though.

865
02:16:37,995 --> 02:16:39,633
Which one?

866
02:16:39,795 --> 02:16:42,912
Let's see how good
a memory you've got for faces.

867
02:17:02,395 --> 02:17:04,704
You.

868
02:17:04,875 --> 02:17:06,706
No.

869
02:17:06,955 --> 02:17:08,149
Him.

870
02:17:08,315 --> 02:17:13,753
We've been hanging out so long we're
starting to look alike. Hanging out.

871
02:17:23,635 --> 02:17:26,149
Charmed.

872
02:17:42,675 --> 02:17:44,586
You can call me Carol.

873
02:17:55,635 --> 02:17:57,785
We've already met.

874
02:18:15,275 --> 02:18:17,266
Pleasure.

875
02:18:18,275 --> 02:18:20,311
The pleasure...

876
02:18:20,475 --> 02:18:22,625
...is all mine.

877
02:18:48,515 --> 02:18:51,268
So you left Detroit, huh?

878
02:18:51,435 --> 02:18:54,074
Her and her husband
just come in on weekends.

879
02:18:54,235 --> 02:18:56,146
Yeah, beats the seashore.

880
02:18:57,075 --> 02:19:00,988
She takes on 10 guys while her hubby
watches through the peephole.

881
02:19:01,155 --> 02:19:03,191
Beats the hell out of the movies.

882
02:19:03,355 --> 02:19:05,869
I wonder what that jerk
is up to in his cubbyhole?

883
02:19:06,035 --> 02:19:09,107
He must be wondering
where is his fucking wife.

884
02:19:15,955 --> 02:19:19,584
Why don't we make it a threesome, huh?

885
02:19:19,755 --> 02:19:22,747
Can't you see he's got
other plans for tonight?

886
02:19:22,915 --> 02:19:26,828
Well, bring her along.
We'll make it a foursome.

887
02:19:30,955 --> 02:19:33,992
I'm not that kind of guy.

888
02:19:34,155 --> 02:19:38,785
I'm afraid if I give you a good crack
in the mouth, you'd probably like it.

889
02:19:51,635 --> 02:19:53,990
Have a good night, fellas.

890
02:19:54,595 --> 02:19:56,472
See you later.

891
02:20:09,035 --> 02:20:11,993
- Been waiting long?
- All my life.

892
02:20:31,435 --> 02:20:35,747
You wanted a place by the ocean. I had
it opened. It was closed for the season.

893
02:20:35,915 --> 02:20:38,588
All these tables are for two people.

894
02:20:38,915 --> 02:20:41,270
Pick whatever one you want.

895
02:21:11,515 --> 02:21:13,073
I like this one.

896
02:21:13,235 --> 02:21:15,271
Here, sit down.

897
02:21:21,755 --> 02:21:23,791
<i>Buf à la mode.</i>
<i>Blanquette de veau.</i>

898
02:21:24,355 --> 02:21:27,825
I'll have the <i>asperges sauce</i>
<i>vinaigrette</i> and then a <i>chateaubriand.</i>

899
02:21:27,995 --> 02:21:29,951
<i>- Pommes frites?</i>
<i>- Nature.</i>

900
02:21:30,115 --> 02:21:32,948
<i>- Comme dessert?</i>
- I'll decide later.

901
02:21:33,115 --> 02:21:35,583
- Monsieur?
- I'll have the same.

902
02:21:36,635 --> 02:21:38,387
For the wine?

903
02:21:38,555 --> 02:21:40,705
You decide.
I'll just have water.

904
02:21:40,875 --> 02:21:44,663
- You decide.
- Thank you.

905
02:21:51,675 --> 02:21:53,074
You've been around.

906
02:21:54,195 --> 02:21:57,392
Where'd you learn them
<i>parlez-vous français</i> dishes?

907
02:21:57,555 --> 02:22:00,149
Who's teaching you
that stuff?

908
02:22:00,315 --> 02:22:03,432
You mean a sugar daddy,
who tries to teach me how to act?

909
02:22:05,755 --> 02:22:10,909
I read books. I want to know everything.
Doesn't it make sense to have plans?

910
02:22:12,195 --> 02:22:14,345
Yeah, it does.

911
02:22:14,835 --> 02:22:17,907
What about me?
Am I in any of these plans?

912
02:22:19,755 --> 02:22:21,586
Noodles...

913
02:22:22,955 --> 02:22:26,345
You're the only person that I have ever...

914
02:22:26,515 --> 02:22:29,552
Ever what? Go ahead.

915
02:22:30,915 --> 02:22:32,826
Ever what?

916
02:22:33,395 --> 02:22:35,829
That I ever cared about.

917
02:22:36,195 --> 02:22:39,710
But you'd lock me up and
throw away the key, wouldn't you?

918
02:22:44,035 --> 02:22:45,787
Yeah.

919
02:22:46,555 --> 02:22:48,432
Yeah, I guess so.

920
02:22:48,595 --> 02:22:50,631
Yeah...

921
02:22:50,795 --> 02:22:53,946
And the thing is,
I probably wouldn't even mind.

922
02:22:56,195 --> 02:23:00,825
- So?
- So I got to get to where I'm going.

923
02:23:00,995 --> 02:23:03,668
- And where's that?
- To the top.

924
02:23:07,235 --> 02:23:09,874
Now you sound just like Maxie.

925
02:23:10,395 --> 02:23:13,626
Youse both alike,
that's why you hate each other.

926
02:23:13,795 --> 02:23:15,911
Do you want me to leave?

927
02:23:20,755 --> 02:23:23,189
No, I don't want you to leave.

928
02:23:44,995 --> 02:23:47,145
You dancing?

929
02:23:47,635 --> 02:23:49,193
- You asking?
- I'm asking.

930
02:23:49,355 --> 02:23:51,346
I'm dancing.

931
02:25:01,195 --> 02:25:05,666
To keep from going crazy, you have to
cut yourself off from the outside world.

932
02:25:05,835 --> 02:25:08,349
Just not think about it.

933
02:25:08,515 --> 02:25:11,666
Yet there were years that
went by, it seemed like...

934
02:25:11,835 --> 02:25:14,986
...no time at all,
because you're not doing anything.

935
02:25:15,155 --> 02:25:18,864
There were two things I couldn't
get out of my mind. One was Dominic.

936
02:25:19,035 --> 02:25:22,107
The way he said, "I slipped,"
just before he died.

937
02:25:23,355 --> 02:25:25,505
The other was you.

938
02:25:31,475 --> 02:25:35,514
How you used to read me
your <i>Song of Songs,</i> remember?

939
02:25:37,235 --> 02:25:41,513
<i>How beautiful are your feet</i>
<i>In sandals, O prince's daughter</i>

940
02:25:44,995 --> 02:25:49,944
I used to read the Bible every night.
Every night I used to think about you.

941
02:25:52,115 --> 02:25:56,631
<i>Your navel is a bowl</i>
<i>Well-rounded with no lack of wine</i>

942
02:25:57,075 --> 02:26:00,511
<i>Your belly, a heap of wheat</i>
<i>Surrounded with lilies</i>

943
02:26:00,675 --> 02:26:02,984
<i>Your breasts</i>

944
02:26:04,475 --> 02:26:06,830
<i>Clusters of grapes</i>

945
02:26:07,515 --> 02:26:12,305
<i>Your breath, sweet-scented as apples</i>

946
02:26:18,955 --> 02:26:21,913
Nobody's gonna love you
the way I loved you.

947
02:26:26,235 --> 02:26:29,591
At times I couldn't stand it.
I used to think of you.

948
02:26:29,755 --> 02:26:33,668
I'd think, " Deborah lives.
She's out there. She exists."

949
02:26:33,835 --> 02:26:36,224
And that would get me through it all.

950
02:26:38,675 --> 02:26:41,109
You know how important
that was to me?

951
02:26:47,115 --> 02:26:49,629
I'm leaving tomorrow
to go to Hollywood.

952
02:26:49,795 --> 02:26:52,468
I wanted to see you tonight
to tell you.

953
02:28:41,915 --> 02:28:43,507
No.

954
02:28:43,955 --> 02:28:45,468
No!

955
02:28:46,075 --> 02:28:48,430
No! No.

956
02:28:52,235 --> 02:28:57,104
No. Please, no. No, please. No!

957
02:28:57,275 --> 02:29:02,349
No! No! No, please!

958
02:29:02,515 --> 02:29:07,794
No, no! Please, no, no. No.

959
02:29:10,635 --> 02:29:12,307
No!

960
02:30:43,315 --> 02:30:44,464
Deborah.

961
02:30:45,315 --> 02:30:47,351
Get away! Get away!

962
02:31:03,595 --> 02:31:05,472
I'll be right back.

963
02:31:35,915 --> 02:31:37,633
Take her home.

964
02:31:38,515 --> 02:31:40,267
Take her home.

965
02:35:27,164 --> 02:35:28,643
Well...

966
02:35:29,284 --> 02:35:31,400
...Iook who's back.

967
02:35:32,644 --> 02:35:34,316
What's this?

968
02:35:37,684 --> 02:35:39,356
It's a throne.

969
02:35:41,444 --> 02:35:43,719
It was a gift to a pope.

970
02:35:44,564 --> 02:35:49,558
- Cost me 800 bucks.
- It's from the 17th century.

971
02:35:57,644 --> 02:35:59,999
So, what are you doing with it?

972
02:36:02,724 --> 02:36:04,954
I'm sitting on it.

973
02:36:12,484 --> 02:36:15,521
- You got any coffee around?
- Yes.

974
02:36:26,884 --> 02:36:28,476
Thanks.

975
02:37:43,204 --> 02:37:47,755
While you were on vacation,
we were working overtime.

976
02:37:54,644 --> 02:37:56,680
The union paid off.

977
02:37:59,444 --> 02:38:01,400
That's your share.

978
02:38:02,484 --> 02:38:06,602
Yeah. Even that geek.
You know, Jimmy "Clean Hands."

979
02:38:06,764 --> 02:38:12,316
He respects us.
I shed a little blood for the cause.

980
02:38:12,484 --> 02:38:14,793
Here, it's all in the papers.

981
02:38:14,964 --> 02:38:18,923
<i>Morning Telegraph,</i> they didn't like it.

982
02:38:19,084 --> 02:38:23,714
It says, " Underworld joins strikers
in brutal battle."

983
02:38:23,884 --> 02:38:27,513
But <i>The Post,</i> they liked it.

984
02:38:27,684 --> 02:38:31,233
"Ends justify means
in decisive gangland encounter."

985
02:38:31,644 --> 02:38:34,875
And they kvetched
about the Atlantic City job.

986
02:38:35,044 --> 02:38:38,434
Newspaper guys never know
what the fuck they want.

987
02:38:45,084 --> 02:38:48,315
- Well, you could have looked for me.
- We did.

988
02:38:49,604 --> 02:38:51,959
Cockeye found you at the Chink's.

989
02:38:52,124 --> 02:38:54,763
So doped up
you didn't even recognize him.

990
02:38:54,964 --> 02:38:59,913
There you were.
You called me "Deborah."

991
02:39:01,604 --> 02:39:03,834
Go fuck yourself.
Mind your own business.

992
02:39:04,004 --> 02:39:08,122
We do our business together, and
broads do not get in the way...

993
02:39:08,284 --> 02:39:09,512
...and you know it!
- Yeah?

994
02:39:09,684 --> 02:39:11,834
- Yeah.
- What's she doing here?

995
02:39:13,244 --> 02:39:16,680
It ain't Saturday.
She should be screwing in Detroit.

996
02:39:16,844 --> 02:39:19,517
Well, she's screwing here now.

997
02:39:19,684 --> 02:39:23,233
And only with Max.

998
02:39:23,844 --> 02:39:25,721
Oh, yeah?

999
02:39:25,884 --> 02:39:30,275
- With her husband peeping through?
- No, I left him.

1000
02:39:34,164 --> 02:39:37,759
You live with her and
you tell me not to mess with broads.

1001
02:39:37,924 --> 02:39:39,596
- You forget one thing.
- What?

1002
02:39:39,764 --> 02:39:41,834
- I don't give a fuck about her.
- Max...

1003
02:39:42,004 --> 02:39:45,121
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Hey, Maxie, tell me something.

1004
02:39:45,284 --> 02:39:51,075
- What'll you spend your honeymoon on?
- Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

1005
02:39:52,324 --> 02:39:54,315
Just shut up!

1006
02:39:58,604 --> 02:40:00,515
You want me to dump her?

1007
02:40:00,964 --> 02:40:04,639
You want me to kick her fucking ass
out of here?

1008
02:40:04,804 --> 02:40:07,034
Want me to kick her ass out
or what?

1009
02:40:07,204 --> 02:40:11,755
You want me to kick...? Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out! Get out!

1010
02:40:18,524 --> 02:40:21,243
Gonna tell me I don't
have a way with women?

1011
02:40:33,564 --> 02:40:35,953
- Hello.
<i>- This is Jimmy. Who 's this, Max?</i>

1012
02:40:36,124 --> 02:40:38,080
No, it's Noodles.

1013
02:40:40,324 --> 02:40:44,158
Okay, listen.
We're gonna need you guys today.

1014
02:40:44,324 --> 02:40:47,441
I'm gonna be making a
tough speech, and I think you...

1015
02:40:57,644 --> 02:40:59,600
Go, go!

1016
02:41:20,004 --> 02:41:23,121
Start the engine.
I'll be right with you.

1017
02:41:23,284 --> 02:41:27,357
Mr. Gallagher wants you to know
he appreciates what you did.

1018
02:41:27,524 --> 02:41:29,833
To show his appreciation...

1019
02:41:39,844 --> 02:41:42,836
Here's an envelope
for the both of you.

1020
02:41:43,004 --> 02:41:47,520
If we gotta complete the job,
I'll let you know.

1021
02:42:23,404 --> 02:42:25,713
Wiped out by a blast of Cordon Rouge.

1022
02:42:25,884 --> 02:42:29,399
What would Crowning
and his bosses say after that?

1023
02:42:29,564 --> 02:42:31,361
Never be afraid of you, then.

1024
02:42:31,524 --> 02:42:36,075
They're still not afraid of me.
It was you boys that scared them off.

1025
02:42:36,324 --> 02:42:40,522
And you didn't want these guys.
You're lucky you got party leaders...

1026
02:42:40,684 --> 02:42:42,879
...like me who care about the union.

1027
02:42:43,044 --> 02:42:47,196
The strike is settled. We won.
That's what counts. Am I right, Jim?

1028
02:42:47,364 --> 02:42:50,993
It was tough for Jimmy not
to be there to sign the contract.

1029
02:42:51,164 --> 02:42:52,643
No.

1030
02:42:54,244 --> 02:42:58,874
What's tough is, you did more in a night
than I could in two years of talking.

1031
02:42:59,044 --> 02:43:01,160
- Forget it.
- To the hottest newcomer...

1032
02:43:01,324 --> 02:43:04,953
...in American unions, Jimmy Conway.
- Now you're talking.

1033
02:43:05,124 --> 02:43:06,921
Roll out the barrel.

1034
02:43:07,084 --> 02:43:11,202
- And God bless.
- Drink up, Jim. Suck it right down.

1035
02:43:11,364 --> 02:43:15,152
You must be crazy giving him drinks.
We're going to operate.

1036
02:43:15,324 --> 02:43:19,920
What's the rush? They already told me
I'd be a gimp the rest of my life.

1037
02:43:20,084 --> 02:43:25,033
Don't worry, with one leg a little shy,
you're gonna take giant steps.

1038
02:43:25,204 --> 02:43:29,163
Yeah. And always one step
right behind you, Sharkey?

1039
02:43:29,324 --> 02:43:31,918
Make sure they work on
the right leg, Jim.

1040
02:43:32,084 --> 02:43:34,757
It's only blood, huh?

1041
02:43:41,844 --> 02:43:46,634
You boys got yourself a real martyr
for a friend. Make it work for you.

1042
02:43:46,804 --> 02:43:49,876
Yeah, but what are we going
to do with a martyr?

1043
02:43:50,044 --> 02:43:54,083
Times change. Prohibition won't
last much longer. Take it from me...

1044
02:43:54,244 --> 02:44:00,319
...a lot of you will be out of work.
- Go on, Mr. Sharkey. We're interested.

1045
02:44:01,684 --> 02:44:05,074
You ever think of setting
yourselves up in business?

1046
02:44:05,444 --> 02:44:09,960
All those trucks used to haul liquor,
soon be selling them for nothing.

1047
02:44:10,124 --> 02:44:15,198
I'm talking about hundreds of vehicles
controlled by a national organization.

1048
02:44:15,364 --> 02:44:18,800
And supported by a powerful union
headed by Jimmy.

1049
02:44:18,964 --> 02:44:22,877
Whatever you ask,
there's no way he can turn you down.

1050
02:44:23,524 --> 02:44:25,480
You gotta be kidding, Sharkey.

1051
02:44:27,604 --> 02:44:30,801
Jimmy "Clean Hands"
in business with us?

1052
02:44:31,404 --> 02:44:34,760
They won't be clean for long,
with the hands he'll shake.

1053
02:44:34,924 --> 02:44:37,438
Everything in good time.

1054
02:44:51,684 --> 02:44:55,518
- We're not interested.
- What's the matter, you got a problem?

1055
02:44:55,684 --> 02:44:59,199
We got plenty of money tucked away.
Why not invest it?

1056
02:44:59,364 --> 02:45:03,482
I'll put the party behind you.
And I got friends in high places.

1057
02:45:04,964 --> 02:45:08,081
I'm not interested,
and I don't trust politicians.

1058
02:45:08,244 --> 02:45:10,712
You still think
like some street schmuck.

1059
02:45:10,884 --> 02:45:14,035
If we'd listened to you,
we'd still be rolling drunks.

1060
02:45:14,204 --> 02:45:16,115
- You broke?
- Don't bust my balls.

1061
02:45:16,284 --> 02:45:19,196
I am talking about real money.

1062
02:45:19,684 --> 02:45:25,122
This is real money to me. It's a lot
of money. You want any of it?

1063
02:45:25,564 --> 02:45:29,796
- You carry that stink of the street.
- I like that. It makes me feel good.

1064
02:45:29,964 --> 02:45:33,320
I like the smell of it.
It opens up my lungs.

1065
02:45:34,004 --> 02:45:35,995
And it gives me a hard-on.

1066
02:45:36,164 --> 02:45:38,394
You're carrying dead weight, Maxie.

1067
02:45:38,564 --> 02:45:41,681
One of these days,
you're gonna have to dump it.

1068
02:45:45,164 --> 02:45:47,837
Let me know
when you're gonna dump me.

1069
02:45:48,004 --> 02:45:51,440
Meanwhile, I'll be in Florida.
I got a yen for the seashore.

1070
02:46:16,924 --> 02:46:19,961
Listen, I was thinking it over...

1071
02:46:20,964 --> 02:46:24,843
...and I guess I kind of got a yen
for the seashore myself.

1072
02:46:30,244 --> 02:46:31,757
You wanna go swimming?

1073
02:46:32,604 --> 02:46:36,597
Yeah. Yeah, let's go for a swim.

1074
02:46:53,764 --> 02:46:55,914
Read all about it!

1075
02:46:58,084 --> 02:47:00,473
Read all about it!

1076
02:48:12,004 --> 02:48:13,881
Hey, Maxie.

1077
02:48:14,444 --> 02:48:15,763
Max.

1078
02:48:16,884 --> 02:48:19,523
How much money we got put away?

1079
02:48:19,764 --> 02:48:21,117
Why?

1080
02:48:23,844 --> 02:48:26,153
Because we're unemployed.

1081
02:48:40,604 --> 02:48:42,993
About a million bucks.

1082
02:48:43,484 --> 02:48:48,000
- Oh, yeah? Where'd you put it?
- In my underwear.

1083
02:48:50,044 --> 02:48:52,239
I'd have found it there.

1084
02:49:19,684 --> 02:49:24,041
We gotta reorganize, Max.
And I got a couple of good ideas.

1085
02:49:25,364 --> 02:49:26,797
Me too.

1086
02:49:27,284 --> 02:49:30,196
If I had a million bucks,
I'd take it easy.

1087
02:49:30,364 --> 02:49:32,639
We'll take it easy when we got 20.

1088
02:49:33,964 --> 02:49:37,161
- Fifty.
- Where you gonna get that?

1089
02:49:40,364 --> 02:49:41,956
Right here.

1090
02:49:50,924 --> 02:49:52,596
What's that?

1091
02:49:55,884 --> 02:49:57,715
It's a dream.

1092
02:50:00,044 --> 02:50:02,683
A dream I've been dreaming
all my life.

1093
02:50:02,844 --> 02:50:06,803
I swear to God, you and me together,
we can make it come true.

1094
02:50:10,564 --> 02:50:11,713
What is it?

1095
02:50:16,804 --> 02:50:18,556
The Federal Reserve Bank.

1096
02:50:22,124 --> 02:50:25,434
It's the biggest step
we can take, Noodles.

1097
02:50:47,564 --> 02:50:49,316
You're really crazy.

1098
02:50:50,484 --> 02:50:54,955
Don't you ever say that to me.
Don't ever say that to me again!

1099
02:52:17,204 --> 02:52:21,880
What chance is there that a crazy
thing like this might succeed?

1100
02:52:23,044 --> 02:52:24,875
Don't ask me, ask Max.

1101
02:52:25,284 --> 02:52:30,881
You know as well as I do that this is
suicide, pure and simple, for everyone.

1102
02:52:31,604 --> 02:52:36,803
Yeah, well, don't tell me, tell him.
You got your own methods.

1103
02:52:37,284 --> 02:52:38,922
I tried.

1104
02:52:39,924 --> 02:52:42,882
He doesn't want to screw anymore.

1105
02:52:45,724 --> 02:52:48,921
All he thinks about is this job.

1106
02:52:51,324 --> 02:52:54,282
Tear gas, hostages,
now he's gonna do this.

1107
02:52:54,444 --> 02:52:57,720
He's gonna do it with or without you.

1108
02:53:02,764 --> 02:53:06,040
Noodles, we've never liked each other.

1109
02:53:10,164 --> 02:53:15,557
We put up with each other for Max.
So why don't we get together once...

1110
02:53:15,724 --> 02:53:18,363
...and do something for him.

1111
02:53:27,684 --> 02:53:29,561
And after that...

1112
02:53:30,564 --> 02:53:33,601
...we can go back to being enemies.

1113
02:53:41,764 --> 02:53:46,599
You know,
if you were all in jail first...

1114
02:53:46,764 --> 02:53:49,722
...there wouldn't be any bank job.

1115
02:54:00,804 --> 02:54:03,364
I got the idea from your friend Max.

1116
02:54:05,124 --> 02:54:06,273
What do you mean?

1117
02:54:09,244 --> 02:54:12,441
He laughs at you. He makes fun of you.

1118
02:54:14,204 --> 02:54:17,355
He says Eve has got you by the balls.

1119
02:54:17,524 --> 02:54:21,278
Every time you walk past this place,
you shit in your pants.

1120
02:54:21,444 --> 02:54:27,474
You'd do anything for the cops to pick
you up so you wouldn't have to do this.

1121
02:54:39,444 --> 02:54:40,957
Well, then do it.

1122
02:54:41,124 --> 02:54:44,275
Do it. Put him in jail.
Put him in jail. Not long.

1123
02:54:44,444 --> 02:54:48,153
Just long enough so he can get
the idea out of his mind.

1124
02:54:49,884 --> 02:54:54,799
If you can't stand being away
from him, put yourself there too.

1125
02:54:56,324 --> 02:54:59,122
Better off than being dead.

1126
02:55:03,364 --> 02:55:05,559
You know what to do.

1127
02:55:09,044 --> 02:55:11,763
And if you don't, I will.

1128
02:55:15,044 --> 02:55:16,238
Get out!

1129
02:55:16,404 --> 02:55:20,477
Take a cab. I'm busy.
I got things to do. Get out.

1130
02:55:25,804 --> 02:55:26,873
Noodles.

1131
02:55:27,884 --> 02:55:30,682
Make up your mind fast, huh?

1132
02:56:51,924 --> 02:56:53,915
What's the matter?

1133
02:56:54,404 --> 02:56:56,793
Aren't you having a good time?

1134
02:57:03,324 --> 02:57:05,792
Why are you going out tonight?

1135
02:57:06,324 --> 02:57:09,441
Why bother now that prohibition
is almost over?

1136
02:57:11,404 --> 02:57:15,158
Everybody's selling. We got friends
who wanna get rid of booze.

1137
02:57:15,324 --> 02:57:19,602
Practically nothing.
So we figured, why not.

1138
02:57:25,524 --> 02:57:28,197
I'm gonna be gone for a while.

1139
02:57:28,484 --> 02:57:31,282
I'll be waiting at the hotel.

1140
02:57:32,084 --> 02:57:36,043
I like it when you come home
late and wake me up.

1141
02:57:41,404 --> 02:57:43,520
I'm not gonna be home tonight.

1142
02:57:50,244 --> 02:57:52,678
I'm not gonna be home tomorrow either.

1143
02:57:53,124 --> 02:57:56,912
I thought these things
only take a couple of hours.

1144
02:58:03,044 --> 02:58:08,721
Ladies and gents, I drink to the demise
of Fat Moe's speakeasy.

1145
02:58:09,004 --> 02:58:13,122
Who the hell wants to drink
here legally anyway, am I right?

1146
02:58:13,604 --> 02:58:16,960
Okay. Come on, Moe, set them up.
Go on, get in there.

1147
02:58:31,364 --> 02:58:33,514
Here's mud in your eye.

1148
02:58:39,924 --> 02:58:41,357
Boys.

1149
02:58:44,604 --> 02:58:46,640
Let's drink to our last shipment.

1150
02:58:46,804 --> 02:58:49,523
There's more onboard
tonight than just booze.

1151
02:58:49,684 --> 02:58:54,883
It's 10 years of our lives. Ten years
that were really worth living.

1152
02:58:55,044 --> 02:58:56,363
Yeah.

1153
02:59:14,084 --> 02:59:15,836
Noodles.

1154
02:59:17,164 --> 02:59:18,677
Noodles.

1155
02:59:20,644 --> 02:59:22,521
<i>- L 'Chaim.</i>
<i>- L 'Chaim.</i>

1156
02:59:25,684 --> 02:59:28,152
How long will I have to wait?

1157
02:59:31,684 --> 02:59:35,040
A year and a half, more or less.

1158
02:59:36,364 --> 02:59:38,434
Six months off for good behavior.

1159
02:59:38,884 --> 02:59:41,603
- What are you gonna do?
- Don't ask.

1160
03:01:12,484 --> 03:01:14,236
<i>Operator.</i>

1161
03:01:15,524 --> 03:01:16,639
Police, please.

1162
03:01:22,404 --> 03:01:24,554
Fifth Precinct. Sergeant Halloran.

1163
03:01:27,204 --> 03:01:28,683
<i>Hello.</i>

1164
03:01:29,604 --> 03:01:32,562
<i>Who 's speaking? Can I help you?</i>

1165
03:01:32,724 --> 03:01:34,123
<i>Hello.</i>

1166
03:01:37,124 --> 03:01:38,796
I got a good tip for you.

1167
03:02:04,204 --> 03:02:07,833
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's Max. Open the door.

1168
03:02:13,484 --> 03:02:17,363
- What's the matter with you? You sick?
- No, I'm fine.

1169
03:02:17,524 --> 03:02:19,116
You don't look it.

1170
03:02:21,164 --> 03:02:23,883
Maybe you'd better
stay home tonight, huh?

1171
03:02:24,364 --> 03:02:25,717
Why?

1172
03:02:29,524 --> 03:02:32,322
You know, I've been
watching you all night.

1173
03:02:33,764 --> 03:02:36,483
And you've been drinking like a fish.

1174
03:02:37,324 --> 03:02:39,633
Trying to get your courage up?

1175
03:02:43,004 --> 03:02:46,155
We're only bringing in
a shipment of booze.

1176
03:02:47,644 --> 03:02:50,716
It's got so you're even
scared to do that.

1177
03:02:52,404 --> 03:02:55,043
Maybe you just better
stay home tonight.

1178
03:02:56,044 --> 03:02:57,523
With Eve.

1179
03:03:07,444 --> 03:03:11,676
Hey, Maxie, everywhere you go,
I go too. Remember that.

1180
03:03:21,124 --> 03:03:23,479
Maybe Sharkey was right.

1181
03:03:23,644 --> 03:03:26,317
Maybe I ought to just dump you.

1182
03:03:35,084 --> 03:03:38,554
- You're really crazy.
- Never say that.

1183
03:03:39,044 --> 03:03:42,081
Don't say it!

1184
03:03:48,884 --> 03:03:52,593
Max made fools of us, Noodles.
He wanted to die.

1185
03:03:52,764 --> 03:03:55,676
Did you know his old man
died in the nut house?

1186
03:03:55,844 --> 03:03:58,563
Max didn't want to
end up the same way.

1187
03:03:58,764 --> 03:04:02,723
So he put the idea
in our heads to tip off the cops.

1188
03:04:02,884 --> 03:04:07,560
And when they stopped the truck,
Max started shooting first...

1189
03:04:07,724 --> 03:04:10,875
...just to get himself killed.

1190
03:04:27,364 --> 03:04:29,594
What is this?

1191
03:04:32,524 --> 03:04:33,639
Opening night.

1192
03:04:35,244 --> 03:04:37,804
Fifteen years ago.

1193
03:04:38,244 --> 03:04:40,155
Who's this?

1194
03:04:41,804 --> 03:04:44,682
Patron saint of the place.

1195
03:04:46,004 --> 03:04:48,154
And some actress.

1196
03:04:48,924 --> 03:04:50,243
Do you know her?

1197
03:04:52,164 --> 03:04:53,643
No.

1198
03:05:44,604 --> 03:05:46,799
Hello, Deborah.

1199
03:05:54,084 --> 03:05:56,644
Aren't you gonna say anything?

1200
03:06:03,124 --> 03:06:06,321
What is someone
supposed to say after...

1201
03:06:06,924 --> 03:06:09,836
...more than 30 years.

1202
03:06:14,764 --> 03:06:20,475
Well, how about, " How you doing?
You're looking good."

1203
03:06:22,404 --> 03:06:25,441
Or, " I was hoping I'd never
see you again."

1204
03:06:27,764 --> 03:06:30,642
I never thought I would.

1205
03:06:31,684 --> 03:06:33,914
There's a difference.

1206
03:06:34,764 --> 03:06:37,597
At least you recognized me,
that's something.

1207
03:06:37,764 --> 03:06:40,642
Actresses have good memories.

1208
03:06:50,004 --> 03:06:52,234
You want a drink?

1209
03:06:56,284 --> 03:06:58,593
I'm having one.

1210
03:07:08,604 --> 03:07:09,593
Margo.

1211
03:07:11,284 --> 03:07:13,878
- Yes, miss?
- That's all for now. You can go.

1212
03:07:14,044 --> 03:07:16,160
All right, miss.

1213
03:07:20,844 --> 03:07:23,597
She called you "miss."

1214
03:07:23,924 --> 03:07:26,233
You never got married?

1215
03:07:27,044 --> 03:07:28,602
No.

1216
03:07:32,044 --> 03:07:33,523
You live alone?

1217
03:07:41,324 --> 03:07:42,757
No.

1218
03:07:49,324 --> 03:07:51,554
Where were you?

1219
03:07:54,364 --> 03:07:56,673
I was out of town.

1220
03:07:59,404 --> 03:08:02,077
Have you been back long?

1221
03:08:03,004 --> 03:08:05,313
A couple of days.

1222
03:08:05,484 --> 03:08:07,634
Are you staying?

1223
03:08:18,804 --> 03:08:20,157
That depends.

1224
03:08:22,964 --> 03:08:24,955
Why do you want to see me?

1225
03:08:26,724 --> 03:08:28,954
Two reasons.

1226
03:08:29,124 --> 03:08:34,403
Wanted to see if you did the right thing,
turning me down to become an actress.

1227
03:08:38,404 --> 03:08:39,917
Well?

1228
03:08:42,604 --> 03:08:44,913
You did. You're terrific.

1229
03:08:59,884 --> 03:09:02,842
"Age cannot wither her."

1230
03:09:03,044 --> 03:09:05,922
It's like the play
was written for you.

1231
03:09:09,244 --> 03:09:11,599
What was the other reason?

1232
03:09:11,804 --> 03:09:13,999
The other reason...

1233
03:09:17,084 --> 03:09:21,236
...is to decide whether I should go
to a party tomorrow night

1234
03:09:27,684 --> 03:09:29,163
Party?

1235
03:09:32,324 --> 03:09:34,713
Yeah, on Long Island.

1236
03:09:36,164 --> 03:09:39,201
A Secretary Bailey.

1237
03:09:42,884 --> 03:09:44,954
Do you know Secretary Bailey?

1238
03:09:46,724 --> 03:09:47,873
No.

1239
03:09:50,204 --> 03:09:52,434
But I was invited anyway.

1240
03:10:00,604 --> 03:10:03,357
If you don't know each other,
why were you invited?

1241
03:10:03,524 --> 03:10:05,003
I don't know.

1242
03:10:06,564 --> 03:10:08,520
I thought you might know why.

1243
03:10:09,524 --> 03:10:10,843
Me?

1244
03:10:11,044 --> 03:10:12,602
Why me?

1245
03:10:17,804 --> 03:10:19,795
Because you know him.

1246
03:10:20,564 --> 03:10:22,395
- Who is it?
- It's me, David.

1247
03:10:22,604 --> 03:10:25,164
- No, David.
- Can I come in?

1248
03:10:25,364 --> 03:10:28,083
No. Just wait outside, I'll call you.

1249
03:10:28,284 --> 03:10:30,559
Okay, I'll be right here.

1250
03:10:33,244 --> 03:10:36,873
- What does Bailey want from me?
- You came to ask me that?

1251
03:10:37,084 --> 03:10:39,917
- Why'd he send me an invitation?
- I don't know.

1252
03:10:40,124 --> 03:10:44,276
Why should I know about your
invitations? I don't know anything.

1253
03:10:44,484 --> 03:10:48,318
What do you want?
Why did you come here? I know nothing.

1254
03:10:48,484 --> 03:10:51,044
Now you're a lousy actress.

1255
03:10:53,764 --> 03:10:56,483
Who is Secretary Bailey?

1256
03:11:04,884 --> 03:11:08,354
Secretary Bailey is a rich businessman.

1257
03:11:13,844 --> 03:11:18,235
He came to the United States as
an immigrant and made a lot of money...

1258
03:11:18,444 --> 03:11:22,232
...in San Francisco and L.A.,
where he's lived for 30 years.

1259
03:11:22,404 --> 03:11:26,238
I know all that. It's all in the papers.
What else is there?

1260
03:11:32,484 --> 03:11:35,362
He married a very wealthy woman.

1261
03:11:36,604 --> 03:11:38,834
They had a child.

1262
03:11:39,204 --> 03:11:42,116
She died when the child was born.

1263
03:11:42,684 --> 03:11:47,041
A few years ago, he went into politics.
Moved here.

1264
03:11:47,204 --> 03:11:51,641
That's history. I'm not talking
about that. I'm talking about now.

1265
03:11:52,204 --> 03:11:54,718
Right now he's in trouble.

1266
03:11:56,324 --> 03:12:01,603
Just tell me you've been living with him
all these years, and you're his lover.

1267
03:12:10,084 --> 03:12:12,962
Age can wither me, Noodles.

1268
03:12:16,524 --> 03:12:19,038
We're both getting old.

1269
03:12:24,164 --> 03:12:27,315
All that we have left now
are our memories.

1270
03:12:30,124 --> 03:12:35,835
If you go to that party on Saturday
night, you won't have those anymore.

1271
03:12:37,164 --> 03:12:39,519
Tear up that invitation.

1272
03:12:41,804 --> 03:12:44,318
There's an exit back this way.

1273
03:12:45,204 --> 03:12:48,002
Noodles, go through it.

1274
03:12:50,564 --> 03:12:52,361
Keep walking.

1275
03:12:52,564 --> 03:12:54,714
Don't turn around.

1276
03:12:56,004 --> 03:12:58,040
Please, Noodles.

1277
03:12:58,244 --> 03:13:01,122
I'm begging you. Please.

1278
03:13:07,324 --> 03:13:10,714
Are you afraid that I'll turn
into a pillar of salt?

1279
03:13:14,084 --> 03:13:17,679
If you go out that door, yes.

1280
03:14:13,524 --> 03:14:16,357
This is Secretary Bailey's son.

1281
03:14:16,564 --> 03:14:19,920
His name's David, just like yours.

1282
03:17:04,444 --> 03:17:06,196
Please go in.

1283
03:17:20,004 --> 03:17:22,234
What are you waiting for?

1284
03:17:25,764 --> 03:17:28,324
I don't understand, Mr. Bailey.

1285
03:17:53,724 --> 03:17:55,715
Sit down, Noodles.

1286
03:17:59,804 --> 03:18:01,522
Make yourself comfortable.

1287
03:18:19,164 --> 03:18:21,758
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.

1288
03:18:21,924 --> 03:18:23,835
Well, I was curious.

1289
03:18:26,684 --> 03:18:29,676
So many important people in one place.

1290
03:18:29,884 --> 03:18:33,593
Yes. Well, the rats usually
desert a sinking ship.

1291
03:18:34,044 --> 03:18:37,798
But in my case, they appear to be
flocking onboard.

1292
03:18:48,964 --> 03:18:52,639
Yeah, well, I read about
your troubles in the newspapers.

1293
03:18:53,964 --> 03:18:58,435
But a man in your position, with all
your power and all your privileges...

1294
03:18:58,644 --> 03:19:02,717
...has to assume a certain amount
of responsibility...

1295
03:19:03,364 --> 03:19:05,719
...a certain amount of risk.

1296
03:19:12,884 --> 03:19:15,523
Why'd you ask me
to come here, Mr. Bailey?

1297
03:19:18,724 --> 03:19:23,036
That invitation doesn't mean
a goddamn thing, and you know it.

1298
03:19:23,404 --> 03:19:26,794
All that counts is what
was in that suitcase.

1299
03:19:28,404 --> 03:19:30,998
The money and the contract.

1300
03:19:33,724 --> 03:19:36,796
It didn't say who the contract
was on, though.

1301
03:19:38,084 --> 03:19:40,393
Haven't you figured that out yet?

1302
03:19:42,044 --> 03:19:43,523
You, Mr. Bailey?

1303
03:19:56,764 --> 03:20:00,313
I haven't had a gun in my hand
for many, many years.

1304
03:20:01,884 --> 03:20:07,197
My eyes aren't too good,
even with my glasses. My hands shake.

1305
03:20:09,964 --> 03:20:13,798
- And I wouldn't want to miss.
- Cut the bullshit, Noodles.

1306
03:20:15,284 --> 03:20:17,923
I'm already a dead man.

1307
03:20:18,804 --> 03:20:23,036
At least give me the chance
to settle the debt that I owe to you.

1308
03:20:23,684 --> 03:20:27,040
I'll never make it before
the investigating committee.

1309
03:20:27,204 --> 03:20:30,992
They're scared I'll implicate
the whole bunch of 'em.

1310
03:20:31,364 --> 03:20:33,480
They gotta get rid of me.

1311
03:20:36,044 --> 03:20:38,877
Today is as good a day as any.

1312
03:20:41,124 --> 03:20:43,240
You do it, Noodles.

1313
03:20:44,164 --> 03:20:47,395
You're the only person
I can accept it from.

1314
03:20:54,004 --> 03:20:56,472
You see, I found out where you were.

1315
03:20:56,644 --> 03:20:59,602
I brought you back here for this.

1316
03:21:00,884 --> 03:21:03,956
To even the score between you and me.

1317
03:21:06,244 --> 03:21:08,599
You can get out through there.

1318
03:21:15,564 --> 03:21:19,921
It leads right down to the street.
Nobody will see you.

1319
03:21:26,404 --> 03:21:30,602
I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't owe me a thing.

1320
03:21:38,244 --> 03:21:44,114
Your eyes were too full of tears to see
it wasn't me burned up on that street.

1321
03:21:44,924 --> 03:21:46,721
It was somebody else.

1322
03:21:48,244 --> 03:21:52,954
You were too shocked to realize
that the cops were in on it too.

1323
03:21:53,564 --> 03:21:56,636
That was a syndicate
operation, Noodles.

1324
03:22:06,524 --> 03:22:08,435
You're crazy.

1325
03:22:10,804 --> 03:22:14,877
You said that to me once before,
a long time ago.

1326
03:22:15,164 --> 03:22:18,474
My mind was never as clear
as it was at that moment.

1327
03:22:19,204 --> 03:22:22,560
I took away your whole life from you.

1328
03:22:22,764 --> 03:22:25,483
I've been living in your place.

1329
03:22:26,684 --> 03:22:29,152
I took everything.

1330
03:22:30,524 --> 03:22:32,594
I took your money.

1331
03:22:33,284 --> 03:22:35,320
I took your girl.

1332
03:22:36,004 --> 03:22:40,600
All I left for you was 35 years of grief
over having killed me.

1333
03:22:42,364 --> 03:22:44,082
Now, why don't you shoot?

1334
03:24:14,844 --> 03:24:17,642
It's true,
I have killed people, Mr. Bailey.

1335
03:24:17,844 --> 03:24:22,395
Sometimes to defend myself.
Sometimes for money.

1336
03:24:22,684 --> 03:24:25,118
And many people used to come to us.

1337
03:24:25,324 --> 03:24:28,122
Business partners, rivals...

1338
03:24:28,484 --> 03:24:30,554
...Iovers.

1339
03:24:30,924 --> 03:24:34,883
Some of the jobs we took,
and some we didn't.

1340
03:24:47,724 --> 03:24:50,557
Yours is one we would never touch.

1341
03:24:51,404 --> 03:24:54,237
Is this your way of getting revenge?

1342
03:24:58,044 --> 03:24:59,557
No.

1343
03:25:02,764 --> 03:25:05,756
It's just the way I see things.

1344
03:26:05,884 --> 03:26:08,557
It's 10:25...

1345
03:26:09,804 --> 03:26:12,841
...and I've got nothing left to lose.

1346
03:26:14,884 --> 03:26:18,672
When you've been betrayed by a friend,
you hit back.

1347
03:26:23,524 --> 03:26:25,276
Do it.

1348
03:26:46,524 --> 03:26:49,038
You see, Mr. Secretary...

1349
03:26:50,964 --> 03:26:52,955
...I have a story also.

1350
03:26:53,884 --> 03:26:56,318
A little simpler than yours.

1351
03:26:57,404 --> 03:27:01,920
Many years ago I had a friend,
a dear friend.

1352
03:27:03,484 --> 03:27:06,601
I turned him in to save his life...

1353
03:27:06,804 --> 03:27:08,999
...but he was killed.

1354
03:27:10,244 --> 03:27:12,963
But he wanted it that way.

1355
03:27:13,964 --> 03:27:16,080
It was a great friendship.

1356
03:27:19,044 --> 03:27:22,923
It went bad for him,
