00:00:44,104 --> 00:00:46,231
<i>In our relations with other people,</i>

3
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:50,400
<i>we mainly discuss and evaluate</i>

4
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,138
<i>their character and behavior.</i>

5
00:00:54,147 --> 00:00:58,709
<i>That is why I have withdrawn</i>

6
00:00:58,818 --> 00:01:01,480
<i>from nearly all so-called relations.</i>

7
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:07,655
<i>This has made my old age</i>
<i>rather lonely.</i>

8
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:15,190
<i>My life has been full of hard work,</i>
<i>and I am grateful.</i>

9
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:18,031
<i>It began as toil</i>
<i>for bread and butter</i>

10
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:22,905
<i>and ended in a love for science.</i>

11
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:29,210
<i>I have a son, also a doctor,</i>
<i>who lives in Lund.</i>

12
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:34,309
<i>He has been married for many years.</i>
<i>They have no children.</i>

13
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:40,982
<i>My old mother is still alive</i>
<i>and is very active, in spite of her age.</i>

14
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:50,933
<i>My wife Karin</i>
<i>has been dead for many years.</i>

15
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,336
Dinner is served, Professor Borg.

16
00:01:57,877 --> 00:01:59,970
Thank you.

17
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,276
<i>I am lucky</i>
<i>in having a good housekeeper.</i>

18
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:08,885
<i>Perhaps I should add</i>
<i>that I am an old pedant,</i>

19
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:13,219
<i>which at times</i>
<i>has been rather trying</i>

20
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:18,286
<i>for myself and those around me.</i>

21
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,631
<i>My name is Isak Borg,</i>

00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:27,005

25
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:56,257
<i>In the early hours ofJune 1 st,</i>

26
00:03:56,362 --> 00:04:00,458
<i>I had a weird</i>
<i>and very unpleasant dream.</i>

27
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:04,826
<i>I dreamt that during</i>
<i>my morning walk</i>

28
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:10,466
<i>I lost my way among empty streets</i>

29
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:13,067
<i>with ruined houses.</i>

30
00:09:23,456 --> 00:09:24,548
Are you ill?

31
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:28,388
Miss Agda, please prepare
some breakfast. I'm taking the car.

32
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:32,726
Please, Professor! Go back to bed
and I'll bring you coffee at 9:00,

33
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:36,131
and we'll leave at 10:00 as planned.

34
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:38,567
Oh, well, I'll go without breakfast.

35
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:42,668
And who will pack your tails?

36
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:46,810
- I will do it myself.
- And what about me?

37
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,812
You can come in the car or fly.
Please yourself.

38
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,549
I've looked forward to seeing you get
your honorary degree.

39
00:09:58,658 --> 00:10:02,526
And we had arranged
everything so nicely,

40
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:05,927
and now you're taking the car.

41
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:08,660
The ceremony isn't until 5:00.

42
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:12,295
If I leave at once, I've got 14 hours
before the ceremony.

43
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:14,873
You'll ruin everything!

44
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:19,602
What about your son who is expecting you
at the airport in Malmo?

45
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:23,671
You can think up an explanation.

46
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:29,713
If you go by car,
I won't come at all.

47
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:33,150
Now listen, Miss Agda!

48
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:38,287
Take the car, and you'll ruin
the greatest day of my life.

49
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:40,831
We're not married, Miss Agda.

50
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:45,495
I thank God for that every night.

51
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:50,064
I've used my common sense for 74 years,
and it won't let me down now.

52
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:52,667
Is that your last word?

53
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,712
Yes.

54
00:10:56,882 --> 00:11:02,411
But I shall say plenty to myself
about selfish, crabby old men

55
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:08,084
who never think of those who have
served them faithfully for 40 years.

56
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:11,186
Incredible that I have put up...

57
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:16,166
with your bossing for so long.

58
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:19,704
Just give the word,
and I'll leave tomorrow.

59
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:25,243
I'm going by car anyway,
and you can do as you damn well please.

60
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:38,079
I happen to be grown-up
and needn't take orders from you.

61
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:45,623
No one can pack like you, Miss Agda.

62
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:47,528
Really?

63
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:50,068
Old sourpuss.

64
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,103
Shall I boil you a couple of eggs?

65
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:56,641
Yes, please, if you will be
so extremely kind.

66
00:12:01,747 --> 00:12:07,014
The faculty should have made me
honorary idiot.

67
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:14,456
I'll calm the old girl down
with a present.

68
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,256
I hate resentful people.

69
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:21,959
I wouldn't hurt a fly,
let alone Miss Agda.

70
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,662
Toast?

71
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,965
No, don't trouble yourself
on my account.

72
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:29,973
What are <i>you</i> cross about?

73
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,409
Don't you want a cup?

74
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:45,120
Good morning, Uncle Isak.

75
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:49,923
Well, well, why is my daughter-in-law
up at this hour?

76
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:53,624
Who can sleep when you and Aunt Agda
are making such a row?

77
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,030
There has been no row.

78
00:12:56,135 --> 00:12:57,830
No, not at all.

79
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:01,763
You're taking the car to Lund?

80
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:02,898
Yes.

81
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:04,737
Can I come with you?

82
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:06,368
You're going home?

83
00:13:06,478 --> 00:13:09,311
Yes, I want to go home.

84
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,144
Home to Evald?

85
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,877
You don't need to ask why.

86
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:15,647
I would take the train
if I could afford it.

87
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,018
Of course you may ride with me.

88
00:13:18,123 --> 00:13:19,647
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

89
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:24,853
Good heavens!

90
00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:57,595
Please don't smoke.
I can't stand cigarette smoke.

91
00:13:57,696 --> 00:13:59,095
I forgot.

92
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,497
There should be a law
forbidding women to smoke.

93
00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:04,964
Beautiful weather.

94
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,870
Yes, but sultry.

95
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:12,110
- I think we'll have a thunderstorm.
- So do I.

96
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:13,838
No, give me a cigar anytime.

97
00:14:13,946 --> 00:14:17,245
That's stimulating and relaxing.
That's a vice for men.

98
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:20,318
And what vices may a woman have?

99
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:23,547
Weeping, giving birth
and speaking ill of her neighbors.

100
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:26,420
How old are you really, Uncle Isak?

101
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:27,890
Why do you ask?

102
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,756
No reason. Why?

103
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:32,763
I know why you asked.

104
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:34,890
Oh, well.

105
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:41,229
Don't pretend.
You don't like me. You never have.

106
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,774
I only know you
as a father-in-law.

107
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:45,867
Why are you going home?

108
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:47,878
On impulse. Nothing more.

109
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,244
Evald happens to be my son.

110
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,782
So he is.

111
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:55,342
Evald and I are very much alike.
We have our principles.

112
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:57,319
You don't need to tell me <i>that.</i>

113
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:58,822
Now, this loan, for instance.

114
00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:00,789
I know exactly
what you're going to say.

115
00:15:00,893 --> 00:15:03,589
He should have paid it back
when he became an associate professor.

116
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:06,256
It's a matter of honor for him
to pay back 5,000 a year,

117
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:07,696
and so on, and so on.

118
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,734
A promise is a promise.

119
00:15:09,835 --> 00:15:12,668
For us, it means
that we never can be free together,

120
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:14,671
and that your son
works himself to death.

121
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:17,139
You have your own income.

122
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:19,107
Especially when one considers
the fact that you're filthy rich

123
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,576
and don't need the money.

124
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:26,276
A promise is a promise.
And I know Evald respects that.

125
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:29,753
Perhaps.
But he also hates you.

126
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:43,568
What do you have against me?

127
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:45,364
Shall I be frank?

128
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:46,802
Yes, I'm asking you.

129
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:50,667
You're a selfish old man, Uncle Isak.

130
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:55,236
You're utterly ruthless
and never listen to anyone but yourself.

131
00:15:56,315 --> 00:16:01,309
But you hide it all behind
your old-world manners and charm.

132
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:07,816
Beneath your benevolent exterior,
you're as hard as nails.

133
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:13,130
But you can't fool us
who have seen you at close quarters.

134
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,664
Remember when
I came to you a month ago?

135
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:22,238
I had a stupid idea
that you might help Evald and me.

136
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:24,809
So I asked to stay with you
for a week or two.

137
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,378
Remember what you answered?

138
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:30,505
I said I'd be delighted.

139
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:35,220
Perhaps you've forgotten,
but you said,

140
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:40,349
"Don't try to draw me
into your marital squabbles.

141
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:42,187
I don't give a damn.

142
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:44,285
You and Evald must make
the best of it."

143
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:45,954
Did I say that?

144
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:49,330
- Not only that.
- Oh, no.

145
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:51,130
These were your very words:

146
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:54,369
"I have no respect
for mental suffering,

147
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,407
so don't come lamenting to <i>me.</i>

148
00:16:57,242 --> 00:17:01,941
If you need therapy,
you'd better see a shrink.

149
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:05,642
Or why not a minister?
It's in fashion now."

150
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:07,480
Did I say that?

151
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:11,179
Your judgments are very categorical,
Uncle Isak.

152
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,691
I should hate to depend on you.

153
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:23,024
I have liked having you
about the house.

154
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:24,830
Like a cat.

155
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:27,303
A cat or a human being.

156
00:17:27,406 --> 00:17:32,639
You're a fine young woman,
and I'm sorry you dislike me.

157
00:17:32,744 --> 00:17:35,406
- I don't dislike you.
- Really?

158
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,744
- I feel sorry for you.
- Sorry?

159
00:17:42,454 --> 00:17:46,481
I'd like to tell you about a dream
I had this morning.

160
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:48,890
I'm not very interested in dreams.

161
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:52,862
No. No, of course not.

162
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,035
Where are you going now?

163
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:10,707
I want to show you something.

164
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:49,211
We lived here every summer
during the first 20 years of my life.

165
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:52,882
There were ten of us children.
Perhaps you knew that.

166
00:18:54,393 --> 00:18:55,883
Does anyone live here now?

167
00:18:55,994 --> 00:18:57,723
No, not this summer.

168
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,529
I'll go swimming, if you don't mind.
We have plenty of time.

169
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:06,160
Yes, by all means, do.

170
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:22,051
The place where
wild strawberries grow!

171
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,133
<i>Perhaps I got a little sentimental.</i>

172
00:19:39,371 --> 00:19:42,101
<i>Perhaps I got a little tired</i>

173
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,801
<i>and felt a bit sad.</i>

174
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:51,747
<i>It's not impossible that I began</i>
<i>to think of this and that,</i>

175
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,513
<i>associated with places</i>
<i>where I played as a child.</i>

176
00:19:56,855 --> 00:19:59,289
<i>I don't know how it happened,</i>

177
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,816
<i>but the day's clear reality</i>

178
00:20:02,928 --> 00:20:08,093
<i>dissolved into the even clearer</i>
<i>images of memory</i>

179
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,691
<i>that appeared before my eyes</i>

180
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:13,669
<i>with the strength</i>
<i>of a true stream of events.</i>

181
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:31,951
Sara.

182
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:36,688
Sara,

183
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:39,762
it's your cousin Isak.

184
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,494
Well, I've become quite old,
of course, so I don't look the same.

185
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:53,306
But you, you haven't changed at all.

186
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:02,152
Good morning, sweet cousin.
What are you doing?

187
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:04,449
Picking strawberries, silly.
Can't you see?

188
00:21:05,424 --> 00:21:08,052
And who shall be favored
with these delicious berries

189
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,926
picked in the early morn
by a lovely young woman?

190
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,431
Nonsense. You know quite well
that it's Uncle Aron's name day today.

191
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:17,900
I forgot to make a present.

192
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:20,631
So he'll get a basket
of wild strawberries instead.

193
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:21,899
I'll help you.

194
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:25,534
You see, Sigbritt and Charlotta made
a tapestry and Angelica baked a cake,

195
00:21:25,644 --> 00:21:27,373
and Anna has painted
a really good picture,

196
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:30,505
and Kristina and Birgitta
wrote a song that they'll sing to him.

197
00:21:30,615 --> 00:21:33,641
That's the best one.
Uncle Aron is stone-deaf.

198
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,585
He'll be very pleased,
and you're stupid.

199
00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:39,122
And you have a darned cute nape.

200
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,117
You know you shouldn't do that.

201
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:45,719
- Says who?
- <i>I</i> say.

202
00:21:45,831 --> 00:21:48,527
Besides, you're an unusually
insufferable young man

203
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:50,294
who thinks he's really something.

204
00:21:50,402 --> 00:21:52,734
I'm your cousin,
and you're in love with me.

205
00:21:53,672 --> 00:21:54,900
With you!

206
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,999
Come and be kissed on the lips.

207
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:03,307
If you don't behave, I'll tell Isak
you're always trying to kiss me.

208
00:22:03,415 --> 00:22:06,942
Little Isak! I could beat him up
with one arm.

209
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:10,417
You know quite well that Isak and I
are secretly engaged.

210
00:22:10,522 --> 00:22:14,219
So secretly, everyone knows it.

211
00:22:14,326 --> 00:22:17,352
It's not my fault that the twins
let the cat out of the bag.

212
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:21,455
When is the wedding?
When is the wedding?

213
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:27,438
I don't know which of you four brothers
is the least conceited,

214
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,905
but I think it's Isak.

215
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:31,566
Isak is the nicest, anyway.

216
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:34,338
And you're the horridest, nastiest,

217
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:39,315
silliest, stupidest...
I can't find the words to describe you!

218
00:22:39,418 --> 00:22:42,512
Admit you've got
a weak spot for me.

219
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:44,987
And you reek of cigars.

220
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,853
It's a nice manly smell.

221
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,887
And the twins,
who know <i>most</i> things,

222
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:57,833
say you've been up to no good
with that Berglund girl.

223
00:22:57,936 --> 00:23:03,306
She's not a nice girl, the twins say.
And I agree.

224
00:23:03,408 --> 00:23:06,775
How pretty you are
when you blush.

225
00:23:06,878 --> 00:23:10,143
You <i>must</i> kiss me.
I can't bear it any longer.

226
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:14,617
Now that I think of it,
I'm madly in love with you.

227
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,914
- You're just saying that.
- No.

228
00:23:19,224 --> 00:23:21,920
And the twins say

229
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:25,155
that you're <i>mad</i> about girls.

230
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,990
Is that true?

231
00:23:36,808 --> 00:23:39,436
Oh, look what you've done!

232
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:44,811
And what will Isak say,
who really loves me?

233
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:50,478
I'm so sad!
You've hurt me so!

234
00:23:52,157 --> 00:23:54,591
You've made
a bad woman of me.

235
00:23:54,693 --> 00:23:56,718
At any rate, <i>nearly.</i>

236
00:23:56,828 --> 00:24:00,389
I never want to see you again,
at least not before brunch.

237
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:04,324
I have to hurry.
Help me pick up the strawberries.

238
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,000
Oh, and now I've got
a stain on my apron!

239
00:24:37,402 --> 00:24:40,963
Where's Isak?

240
00:24:41,673 --> 00:24:46,474
Out fishing with Papa,
and they can't hear the gong.

241
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:52,539
Anyway, Papa said
not to wait with brunch.

242
00:25:42,434 --> 00:25:44,629
In Jesus' name
we take our seat.

243
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:48,172
Bless, O Lord,
this food we eat. Amen.

244
00:25:57,015 --> 00:26:00,143
Benjamin, go and wash
your hands at once.

245
00:26:00,251 --> 00:26:03,152
How old do you have to be
to learn cleanliness?

246
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:04,778
I <i>have.</i>

247
00:26:05,624 --> 00:26:09,321
Sigbritt, pass Angelica the porridge.

248
00:26:09,427 --> 00:26:12,794
Your fingernails are filthy.

249
00:26:13,765 --> 00:26:15,164
Hagbart, pass the bread.

250
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:20,330
Don't take so much butter.

251
00:26:20,438 --> 00:26:24,431
Charlotta, the salt is lumpy.
You let it get damp.

252
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,635
How often have I told you
not to let it sit out?

253
00:26:26,745 --> 00:26:30,010
It's <i>paint</i> under my nails.

254
00:26:30,115 --> 00:26:31,912
Who gathered
the wild strawberries for me?

255
00:26:32,017 --> 00:26:34,508
- I did.
- What?

256
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:39,684
Speak up, dear.
Uncle Aron can't hear.

257
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:42,624
I did!

258
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:46,356
Fancy your remembering
my name day.

259
00:26:46,464 --> 00:26:48,694
How kind of you.

260
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:53,699
Couldn't Uncle have a drink
to celebrate?

261
00:26:53,805 --> 00:26:56,501
Never when Papa is not at home.

262
00:26:57,275 --> 00:27:00,608
Uncle has already had three drinks.

263
00:27:00,712 --> 00:27:04,614
We saw him when we went out
to bathe at 8:00.

264
00:27:04,716 --> 00:27:07,014
So you've picked berries too.
Thank you.

265
00:27:07,118 --> 00:27:09,916
Twins, speak when spoken to.

266
00:27:11,523 --> 00:27:14,981
And as you didn't make your beds,
you can dry the silver.

267
00:27:16,394 --> 00:27:19,227
You will do as Auntie says.

268
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,026
Benjamin, don't bite your nails.

269
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:25,660
Anna, what are you doing?
Remember you're not a little girl anymore.

270
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,670
I want to give Uncle my picture.

271
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:30,536
Please, Auntie, can't we give him
our presents now?

272
00:27:30,642 --> 00:27:32,405
- Where is your present?
- Under the table.

273
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,205
No, after we've eaten.

274
00:27:35,513 --> 00:27:40,246
A very advanced work of art:
Fritjof and Ingeborg.

275
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:44,219
You can't tell which is Fritjof!

276
00:27:44,322 --> 00:27:49,589
What were Sara and Sigfrid doing
in the wild strawberry patch?

277
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:52,561
We saw you! We saw you!

278
00:27:52,664 --> 00:27:55,326
The twins ought to be muzzled.

279
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:57,526
The twins will be quiet
or leave the table.

280
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,159
No freedom of speech, eh?

281
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,170
Shut up, you brats.

282
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,332
Sara's blushing! Sara's blushing!

283
00:28:06,377 --> 00:28:09,403
Sigfrid is blushing too!
Sigfrid and Sara! Sigfrid and Sara!

284
00:28:09,514 --> 00:28:11,379
Quiet, everybody!

285
00:28:14,853 --> 00:28:16,343
But Sara!

286
00:28:16,454 --> 00:28:18,422
They're lying! They're lying!

287
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:50,110
Isak is so fine and good,

288
00:28:51,322 --> 00:28:55,520
so moral and sensitive.

289
00:28:55,627 --> 00:28:58,755
He wants us to read poetry

290
00:28:59,297 --> 00:29:01,595
and talk about the next life

291
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:05,260
and play four-handed piano.

292
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:10,372
And he only wants to kiss
in the dark,

293
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:14,271
and he talks about sin.

294
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:17,041
He's on such a terribly high level,

295
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:20,874
and I feel so worthless.

296
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,117
And I <i>am</i> worthless...
there's no denying it.

297
00:29:29,627 --> 00:29:33,256
But sometimes it seems to me
that I'm a lot older than Isak,

298
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:35,628
if you know what I mean.

299
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:40,295
And then I think he's a child,
although we're the same age.

300
00:29:41,472 --> 00:29:46,808
And Sigfrid is so bold and exciting,
and I want to go home.

301
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:49,072
I don't want to be here all summer

302
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,705
and be an object of ridicule
for the twins and all of you.

303
00:29:51,816 --> 00:29:53,807
I don't want to!

304
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:56,148
I'll speak to Sigfrid.

305
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:57,721
If he doesn't behave,

306
00:29:57,822 --> 00:30:00,256
I'll make sure he's made to study
during the summer holidays.

307
00:30:00,358 --> 00:30:02,019
Papa will fix that
as easy as anything.

308
00:30:02,126 --> 00:30:05,061
He too thinks Sigfrid is a
good-for-nothing and needs to work.

309
00:30:05,163 --> 00:30:08,655
Poor little Isak
who's so good to me.

310
00:30:09,968 --> 00:30:12,528
How unfair everything is.

311
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:16,333
All will be well, you'll see.

312
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:19,501
Listen, now they're singing
for Uncle Aron.

313
00:30:20,812 --> 00:30:26,114
How silly to write a song
for a deaf old man.

314
00:30:26,217 --> 00:30:27,844
How typical of the twins.

315
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:32,855
<i>Flowers nod, grasses bow</i>

316
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:38,418
<i>Around our lovely house</i>

317
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:44,092
<i>We our Uncle Aron celebrate</i>

318
00:30:44,202 --> 00:30:46,170
<i>And with our song</i>

319
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:50,640
<i>Ornament his brow</i>

320
00:30:51,342 --> 00:30:55,039
Four cheers for Uncle Aron.

321
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:59,242
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!

322
00:31:06,524 --> 00:31:08,856
I'll run down and meet
Isak and Uncle.

323
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,450
You do that.

324
00:31:11,362 --> 00:31:16,891
<i>I was overwhelmed by feelings</i>
<i>of emptiness and sadness,</i>

325
00:31:17,268 --> 00:31:20,965
<i>but was soon awakened</i>
<i>from my reveries</i>

326
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:25,507
<i>by the voice of a young girl</i>
<i>asking me repeatedly about something.</i>

327
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,441
Is this your house?

328
00:31:27,545 --> 00:31:29,638
No, it's not.

329
00:31:29,747 --> 00:31:32,079
You're lucky to be telling the truth.

330
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:35,016
It's my dad who owns the whole
headland, including the house.

331
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:39,021
I lived here once.
Two hundred years ago.

332
00:31:39,123 --> 00:31:41,421
Oh, yeah?

333
00:31:41,826 --> 00:31:45,057
- Is that your car up at the gate?
- Yes, that's my car.

334
00:31:45,163 --> 00:31:46,289
Looks antique.

335
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:49,230
Yes, it's antique, like its owner.

336
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:54,370
So you have self-irony too.
That's fantastic.

337
00:31:54,472 --> 00:31:56,497
Where are you going?
I mean, in which direction?

338
00:31:56,607 --> 00:31:58,438
Well, I'm going to Lund.

339
00:31:58,543 --> 00:32:01,171
But that suits me perfectly.
You see, I'm on my way to Italy.

340
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,009
I'm honored.

341
00:32:04,115 --> 00:32:06,447
My name's Sara.
Silly name, isn't it?

342
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:09,884
My name's Isak.
It's silly too.

343
00:32:09,988 --> 00:32:11,250
Weren't they married?

344
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:16,191
No, unfortunately.
That was Abraham and Sara.

345
00:32:16,294 --> 00:32:17,420
Let's leave, then.

346
00:32:17,528 --> 00:32:21,362
I have another lady with me.
Here she comes.

347
00:32:21,466 --> 00:32:24,333
- Marianne, this is Sara.
- Hello.

348
00:32:24,435 --> 00:32:26,403
We're going to have company
as far as Lund.

349
00:32:26,504 --> 00:32:30,463
Sara's off to Italy, but she's promised
to ride a ways with us.

350
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:33,738
Ironic again, but it suits you.

351
00:32:34,545 --> 00:32:36,035
Let's be off.

352
00:32:40,885 --> 00:32:44,048
Hey, guys, I've got a lift
almost to Italy.

353
00:32:44,155 --> 00:32:50,116
That's Anders and that's Viktor
and this is Father Isak.

354
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,931
That peach you're gaping at
is Marianne.

355
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,197
What a big bus.

356
00:33:01,305 --> 00:33:03,239
Yes, there's room for us all.

357
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:07,471
Put your luggage in the trunk,
if you don't mind.

358
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:26,830
I must tell you, Isak,
that Anders and I are going steady.

359
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:28,694
We're crazy about each other.

360
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,066
Viktor's the chaperone.
Daddy insisted.

361
00:33:33,404 --> 00:33:38,364
Viktor is in love with me too.

362
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:41,343
It's a brilliant move of Daddy's.

363
00:33:41,446 --> 00:33:44,904
I may have to seduce Viktor
to get rid of him.

364
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,450
I'd better tell you I'm a virgin.
That's why I'm so cheeky.

365
00:33:50,555 --> 00:33:52,580
And I smoke a pipe.

366
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:57,787
Viktor says it's good for you.
He's crazy about anything healthy.

367
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:02,632
I was once in love
with a woman called Sara.

368
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:05,133
No! She was like me, wasn't she?

369
00:34:05,236 --> 00:34:08,137
She was, actually.

370
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,797
What happened to her?

371
00:34:09,907 --> 00:34:14,276
She married my brother Sigfrid
and had six children.

372
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:18,314
She's 75 now
and quite a beautiful old lady.

373
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:21,044
I can't think of anything worse
than growing old.

374
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:26,685
Oh, dear,
now I <i>have</i> put my foot in it.

375
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,534
Are you all right?

376
00:35:11,636 --> 00:35:14,662
I have no excuse.
It's all our fault.

377
00:35:14,772 --> 00:35:20,733
My wife was driving.
Are you all right?

378
00:35:21,512 --> 00:35:27,007
The murderers must introduce
themselves! My name's Alman.

379
00:35:27,652 --> 00:35:30,587
That's my wife Berit.
You can see she has been an actress.

380
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,555
That's the complication
we were discussing when...

381
00:35:33,658 --> 00:35:35,819
Come here, Berit,
and say you're sorry.

382
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:39,590
I'm so sorry.
It was all my fault.

383
00:35:39,697 --> 00:35:44,031
I was just going to hit my husband
when that curve appeared.

384
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:49,300
God punishes some people at once,
eh, you Catholic?

385
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:52,399
Let's get your car upright.

386
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,274
- Oh, never mind us. Please.
- Shut up, Sten.

387
00:35:55,379 --> 00:35:59,839
Some people are unselfish,
though <i>you</i> don't think so.

388
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,686
My wife is a little nervous.
We've had a shock.

389
00:36:08,526 --> 00:36:13,361
Just look at him measuring
his strength with the youngsters,

390
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:19,232
straining his flabby muscles
to show off in front of that cute girl.

391
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:28,275
Darling, you might have a stroke.

392
00:36:31,015 --> 00:36:33,381
My wife likes ridiculing me.

393
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:36,385
I let her.
It's psychotherapy.

394
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:44,647
I never know whether my wife
is really crying or just playacting.

395
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,658
I'll be damned if it isn't real.

396
00:37:50,494 --> 00:37:53,327
It happens when you catch
a glimpse of death.

397
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:55,456
Can't you shut up?

398
00:37:55,566 --> 00:37:58,296
My wife can really <i>live</i> a part.

399
00:37:59,136 --> 00:38:02,628
For two years,
she made me think she had cancer

400
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,301
and plagued us
with every possible symptom,

401
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,243
even though the doctors
could find nothing wrong with her.

402
00:38:09,347 --> 00:38:15,115
Eventually we believed her
more than the doctors!

403
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:17,414
It's natural that you're upset,

404
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:19,955
but why not leave your wife
in peace for a while?

405
00:38:20,057 --> 00:38:22,423
A woman has a right
to her tears, eh?

406
00:38:22,526 --> 00:38:25,654
Don't get in the way
of a woman's tears.

407
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:31,797
You are beautiful,
but old Berit's a bit past her prime.

408
00:38:31,902 --> 00:38:33,597
So you can <i>afford</i> to defend her.

409
00:38:33,704 --> 00:38:37,162
I sympathize with her.
For several reasons.

410
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:39,401
Very sarcastic!

411
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,910
Yet you don't seem
in the least hysterical.

412
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,081
But little Berit is.

413
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,645
Do you know
what that means for me?

414
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:50,550
I gather you're a Catholic.

415
00:38:50,654 --> 00:38:53,088
Quite right.
That's how I stand it.

416
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,522
We ridicule each other.

417
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,890
She has her hysteria.
I have my Catholicism.

418
00:38:57,995 --> 00:39:01,226
So, you see,
we need each other.

419
00:39:01,332 --> 00:39:04,426
It's only egoism
that we haven't killed each other.

420
00:39:14,712 --> 00:39:16,737
There it came.

421
00:39:16,847 --> 00:39:20,078
That's what is called syncopes,
isn't it?

422
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:24,751
Very funny.

423
00:39:28,225 --> 00:39:32,286
If I'd had a stopwatch,
I could have timed the explosion.

424
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:35,559
Shut up! Shut up!

425
00:39:41,138 --> 00:39:44,335
This may be too blunt,

426
00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:49,174
but for the children's sake,
will you please get out.

427
00:39:58,722 --> 00:40:01,714
Forgive us, if you can.

428
00:40:32,223 --> 00:40:35,818
<i>It was with mixed feelings</i>
<i>I saw this region again.</i>

429
00:40:36,427 --> 00:40:39,157
<i>I had my first practice here,</i>

430
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:43,894
<i>and my old mother lives nearby.</i>

431
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:56,338
Hello there, Doctor.

432
00:40:57,748 --> 00:41:00,080
So you're in these parts again,
Doctor?

433
00:41:00,184 --> 00:41:03,278
Shall I fill it up?
Pass me the key to the hood.

434
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,581
Eva! Come here a moment!

435
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:14,119
It's Dr. Borg in person.

436
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:19,095
Mom and Dad and the whole countryside
still talk about him.

437
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:21,433
The world's best doctor.

438
00:41:23,007 --> 00:41:26,704
Let's call the baby after him.

439
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:30,143
Isak Akerman... not a bad name
for a prime minister.

440
00:41:30,247 --> 00:41:32,215
Suppose it's a girl.

441
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:35,308
We only have boys.

442
00:41:41,692 --> 00:41:44,684
And how's your father these days?

443
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:48,754
Oh, Dad's getting a bit decrepit.

444
00:41:48,866 --> 00:41:51,630
But Mom's as lively as a cricket.

445
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:55,169
And you're going to see
<i>your</i> mother, Doctor?

446
00:41:56,307 --> 00:42:00,209
She's amazing.
She must be at least 95.

447
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:02,802
- Ninety-six.
- Imagine that.

448
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:06,574
What do I owe you?

449
00:42:06,684 --> 00:42:09,847
- This is on Eva and me!
- Absolutely not!

450
00:42:09,954 --> 00:42:13,822
Don't insult us, Doctor.
We can do the proper thing too!

451
00:42:13,924 --> 00:42:18,486
Why should you pay
for my gasoline?

452
00:42:18,596 --> 00:42:22,362
There are things
that <i>can't</i> be paid back...

453
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:24,126
not even with gas.

454
00:42:24,234 --> 00:42:26,702
We haven't forgotten.

455
00:42:26,804 --> 00:42:30,570
Ask anyone around here.

456
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:33,643
They all remember your kindness.

457
00:42:35,713 --> 00:42:38,944
Maybe I should have stayed here.

458
00:42:39,049 --> 00:42:40,641
What do you mean?

459
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:46,651
You said you should have stayed.

460
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:48,952
Did I?

461
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:52,551
Well, thanks anyway.

462
00:42:53,764 --> 00:42:58,394
Let me know when the new son arrives,
and I'll be the godfather.

463
00:42:58,502 --> 00:43:00,402
You know where to find me.

464
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:26,528
<i>During lunch I was in good spirits</i>

465
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:31,090
<i>and told the young people about</i>
<i>my years as district medical officer.</i>

466
00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:33,829
<i>My stories were quite a success,</i>

467
00:43:33,937 --> 00:43:37,202
<i>and I don't think they laughed</i>
<i>merely out of courtesy.</i>

468
00:43:37,775 --> 00:43:42,235
<i>I had wine with the lunch,</i>
<i>and then port with the coffee.</i>

469
00:43:46,417 --> 00:43:52,014
Ah, when creation shows
so much beauty,

470
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:56,189
how radiant must be its source!

471
00:43:56,293 --> 00:43:58,454
He is going to be a minister,
and Viktor a doctor.

472
00:43:58,562 --> 00:44:00,723
Reciting poetry
is against our agreement

473
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:05,200
not to discuss God
or science on this trip.

474
00:44:05,302 --> 00:44:06,530
It was beautiful!

475
00:44:06,637 --> 00:44:11,040
How can anyone today
study to become a minister!

476
00:44:11,141 --> 00:44:15,544
Your rationalism is as dry as dust.

477
00:44:15,646 --> 00:44:17,375
I say that modern man...

478
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:19,244
I say that...

479
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:24,514
believes only in himself

480
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:26,248
and his biological death.

481
00:44:26,356 --> 00:44:29,120
Modern man is a figment
of your imagination.

482
00:44:29,226 --> 00:44:32,821
Man regards death with horror.

483
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:37,196
Religion for the people.
Opium for the aching limb.

484
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:38,859
How sweet they <i>both</i> are!

485
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:40,994
I always agree with the one
I spoke with last.

486
00:44:41,105 --> 00:44:44,006
Once you believed in Santa Claus...
now in God.

487
00:44:44,108 --> 00:44:47,566
You never had any imagination!

488
00:44:47,678 --> 00:44:50,169
What do you say, Professor?

489
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,082
Whatever I said
would be met with tolerant irony,

490
00:44:56,186 --> 00:44:57,710
so I'll say nothing.

491
00:44:57,821 --> 00:44:59,721
I'm sure they'll be disappointed.

492
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:03,520
No, Sara. Very, very happy.

493
00:45:05,596 --> 00:45:09,088
"Where is the friend I seek

494
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:14,899
at break of day?

495
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:18,964
When night falls, when..."

496
00:45:19,076 --> 00:45:22,375
"When night falls,
I still have not found Him."

497
00:45:22,479 --> 00:45:26,245
"My burning heart
shows me His traces..."

498
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,284
Are you religious, Professor?

499
00:45:30,487 --> 00:45:34,583
"I see His traces

500
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:39,458
wherever flowers bloom.

501
00:45:44,601 --> 00:45:49,868
His love is mingled with every air."

502
00:45:50,808 --> 00:45:53,777
"His voice calls
in the summer wind."

503
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:56,971
Not bad for a love poem.

504
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:02,147
I've gone all solemn again
for no reason.

505
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:08,518
Well, I'm going to call on my mother.
I'll be back soon.

506
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:11,321
- May I come?
- Of course.

507
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,406
Here comes the thunder.

508
00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:36,386
I have just sent you a telegram

509
00:46:36,486 --> 00:46:39,546
on your great day.

510
00:46:39,823 --> 00:46:41,347
And now you're here.

511
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:44,950
We all have our bright moments,
dear Mother.

512
00:46:47,464 --> 00:46:50,228
Is that your wife over there?

513
00:46:50,334 --> 00:46:53,394
I don't want to talk to her.

514
00:46:54,071 --> 00:46:56,471
She has done us too much harm.

515
00:46:56,573 --> 00:46:59,303
No, Mother dear.

516
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:04,005
This is Evald's wife, Marianne.

517
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:07,140
Well, let her come
and say hello to me.

518
00:47:09,453 --> 00:47:11,387
Good day, Mrs. Borg.

519
00:47:11,688 --> 00:47:15,021
And why are you
gadding about like this?

520
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:17,116
I have been in Stockholm for a visit.

521
00:47:17,227 --> 00:47:21,357
Why aren't you with Evald
and the child?

522
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:24,366
Evald and I have no children.

523
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:29,565
These young people nowadays!
I bore ten children.

524
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:37,009
Will you please hand me
that big box over there.

525
00:47:39,049 --> 00:47:41,950
My mother lived in this house.

526
00:47:42,052 --> 00:47:45,681
Do you remember
coming to see her, Isak?

527
00:47:45,789 --> 00:47:47,654
Very well.

528
00:47:47,758 --> 00:47:51,785
Here are some of your toys.

529
00:47:51,895 --> 00:47:56,798
I have been trying to think
which of you owned what.

530
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,631
Ten children,
and all dead except Isak.

531
00:48:00,737 --> 00:48:02,864
Twenty grandchildren.

532
00:48:02,973 --> 00:48:05,908
Evald's the only one
who comes to see me.

533
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:08,739
Don't get me wrong...
I'm not complaining.

534
00:48:09,613 --> 00:48:12,844
Fifteen great-grandchildren
whom I have never seen.

535
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:18,684
I send presents
for all their birthdays.

536
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:24,625
I get letters of thanks,
but nobody bothers to visit me

537
00:48:24,728 --> 00:48:28,255
unless they want to borrow money.

538
00:48:28,365 --> 00:48:31,528
Oh, I know I'm tiresome.

539
00:48:31,635 --> 00:48:34,160
Don't think that, Mother.

540
00:48:34,271 --> 00:48:36,398
And I've one more fault.

541
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,908
I don't die.

542
00:48:39,009 --> 00:48:42,638
The inheritance
isn't being divided up

543
00:48:42,746 --> 00:48:45,772
the way these crafty young people
had planned.

544
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:50,351
This was Sigbritt's doll.

545
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,680
She got it when she turned eight.

546
00:48:53,857 --> 00:48:56,519
I made the dress myself.

547
00:48:56,626 --> 00:48:58,992
But she never cared for it

548
00:48:59,096 --> 00:49:01,030
so it went to Charlotta.

549
00:49:01,131 --> 00:49:04,692
She took care of it...
I remember it clearly.

550
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,233
Do you see who that is?

551
00:49:08,338 --> 00:49:11,637
Sigfrid was three
and you were five.

552
00:49:12,342 --> 00:49:15,778
And myself.

553
00:49:15,879 --> 00:49:18,313
What a fright
one looked in those days.

554
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:20,816
May I have it?

555
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:23,442
By all means.
It's only rubbish.

556
00:49:24,454 --> 00:49:26,285
And here's a coloring book.

557
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:32,022
I don't know whose it was.

558
00:49:32,129 --> 00:49:34,689
They've all put their names in it.

559
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,734
Kristina has scrawled:

560
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:42,794
"I love Papa more than
anything in the whole world."

561
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:49,069
And Birgitta has put:
"I'm going to marry Papa."

562
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,483
Isn't that funny?
I laughed when I saw it.

563
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:59,649
Don't you think it's cold in here?

564
00:49:59,756 --> 00:50:02,384
No, not particularly.

565
00:50:02,492 --> 00:50:06,155
I have felt cold all my life.

566
00:50:06,263 --> 00:50:09,721
Mostly my stomach.
I wonder why.

567
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:12,666
You have low blood pressure.

568
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:17,638
Let us have some tea,
and we can sit and talk.

569
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:20,904
No, thank you, Mother.
We won't disturb you any longer.

570
00:50:25,115 --> 00:50:28,084
Sigbritt's eldest boy
will soon be 50.

571
00:50:28,185 --> 00:50:31,279
I thought of giving him
Father's gold watch.

572
00:50:31,388 --> 00:50:35,290
It has no hands.
Does that matter?

573
00:50:45,235 --> 00:50:49,535
I remember when Sigbritt's boy
was a newborn.

574
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:55,043
He used to lie in the lilac arbor
at the summer house.

575
00:50:55,145 --> 00:50:58,205
Now he's turning 50.

576
00:50:59,316 --> 00:51:04,811
And little cousin Sara used to
carry him around and sing to him.

577
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:07,685
She married Sigfrid,
that good-for-nothing.

578
00:51:08,658 --> 00:51:14,119
Well, you must go now,
or you'll be late for the ceremony.

579
00:51:14,231 --> 00:51:19,294
I am very glad you came,
and I hope to see you again.

580
00:51:19,402 --> 00:51:22,894
Give my love to Evald.
Good-bye.

581
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,999
Where are Anders and Viktor?

582
00:51:52,102 --> 00:51:57,734
They started arguing about God,
and then they lost their tempers.

583
00:51:58,175 --> 00:52:01,303
And Anders tried
to twist Viktor's arm,

584
00:52:01,411 --> 00:52:05,347
and Viktor said that was
a lousy argument for God's existence.

585
00:52:05,448 --> 00:52:09,077
I said they could talk
about me instead.

586
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:13,885
Then they told me to shut up
because I didn't understand the debate,

587
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:15,457
so I left.

588
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:19,689
They went up the hill to fight it out
because each insisted...

589
00:52:19,796 --> 00:52:22,731
the other had hurt
his innermost feelings.

590
00:52:22,832 --> 00:52:25,062
- Where are they now?
- Up there.

591
00:52:29,172 --> 00:52:30,799
I'll see to them.

592
00:52:30,907 --> 00:52:33,341
Which one do <i>you</i> like best?

593
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,940
Which one do you like best?

594
00:52:36,046 --> 00:52:39,413
I don't know.
Anders is going to be a minister...

595
00:52:39,516 --> 00:52:41,541
He's a darling.

596
00:52:42,485 --> 00:52:44,510
But a minister's wife...

597
00:52:44,621 --> 00:52:47,590
Viktor's nice too.
In a different way.

598
00:52:47,691 --> 00:52:51,127
- Viktor will go far, of course.
- What do you mean?

599
00:52:51,228 --> 00:52:56,461
A doctor earns more money.
And ministers are out of date.

600
00:52:56,566 --> 00:53:00,263
Though he has got nice legs
and a sweet neck.

601
00:53:01,504 --> 00:53:03,438
But how <i>can</i> anyone believe in God?

602
00:53:17,087 --> 00:53:19,681
Well? Does God exist?

603
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:48,818
<i>I dozed off,</i>
<i>but was haunted by vivid</i>

604
00:53:48,918 --> 00:53:54,515
<i>and humiliating dreams.</i>

605
00:53:55,458 --> 00:54:01,795
<i>There was something overpowering</i>
<i>in these dream images</i>

606
00:54:01,898 --> 00:54:07,837
<i>that bored relentlessly into my mind.</i>

607
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:20,539
Have you looked in the mirror, Isak?

608
00:54:23,687 --> 00:54:25,678
Then I'll show you
what you look like.

609
00:54:27,691 --> 00:54:30,990
You're a worried old man
who's soon going to die,

610
00:54:31,094 --> 00:54:33,790
but I have all my life before me.

611
00:54:35,365 --> 00:54:37,799
That hurt your feelings, after all.

612
00:54:38,735 --> 00:54:42,000
No, it didn't hurt.

613
00:54:42,105 --> 00:54:47,202
Yes, it hurt
because you can't bear the truth.

614
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:51,771
The truth is that
I've been too considerate.

615
00:54:52,382 --> 00:54:54,543
And so became unintentionally cruel.

616
00:54:57,687 --> 00:54:58,779
I understand.

617
00:54:58,888 --> 00:55:03,825
No, you don't understand.
We don't speak the same language.

618
00:55:05,061 --> 00:55:06,790
Look in the mirror again.

619
00:55:06,896 --> 00:55:08,921
No, don't turn away.

620
00:55:09,532 --> 00:55:11,090
I see.

621
00:55:11,701 --> 00:55:13,362
Listen to me.

622
00:55:14,571 --> 00:55:17,802
I'm going to marry
your brother Sigfrid.

623
00:55:18,641 --> 00:55:22,771
Love is almost a game for us.

624
00:55:24,481 --> 00:55:28,918
Look at your face now.
Try to smile!

625
00:55:30,587 --> 00:55:33,181
There! Now you're smiling.

626
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:37,316
But it hurts so.

627
00:55:37,827 --> 00:55:42,764
As professor emeritus,
you ought to know why it hurts.

628
00:55:42,866 --> 00:55:44,424
But you don't know.

629
00:55:45,568 --> 00:55:49,504
You know so much,
and you don't know anything.

630
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:53,101
I must go.

631
00:55:53,209 --> 00:55:56,736
I promised to keep an eye
on Sigbritt's baby.

632
00:56:25,475 --> 00:56:27,705
Poor little thing.

633
00:56:28,411 --> 00:56:31,175
Hush, baby. Sleep.

634
00:56:32,449 --> 00:56:34,246
Don't be afraid of the wind

635
00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:40,153
or the birds

636
00:56:41,024 --> 00:56:43,959
or the waves of the sea.

637
00:56:44,661 --> 00:56:47,994
I'm here with you,
holding you tight.

638
00:56:48,097 --> 00:56:50,622
Don't be afraid, little one.

639
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:54,162
It will soon be day again.

640
00:56:55,205 --> 00:56:57,173
No one will hurt you.

641
00:56:57,273 --> 00:57:00,436
I am with you.
I am holding you.

642
01:00:08,498 --> 01:00:10,591
Please come in, Professor Borg.

643
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:30,936
Have you brought
your examination book?

644
01:01:38,454 --> 01:01:42,083
Please identify the bacterial specimen
under the microscope.

645
01:01:53,536 --> 01:01:55,595
There must be something wrong.

646
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:01,332
Not with the microscope.

647
01:02:01,444 --> 01:02:04,743
I can't see a thing.

648
01:02:05,782 --> 01:02:08,512
Please read this text.

649
01:02:23,432 --> 01:02:24,865
What does it mean?

650
01:02:26,602 --> 01:02:28,365
I don't know.

651
01:02:30,006 --> 01:02:31,098
Really?

652
01:02:31,207 --> 01:02:35,007
I'm a doctor, not a linguist.

653
01:02:36,078 --> 01:02:41,812
What you see on the blackboard
is a doctor's first duty.

654
01:02:42,952 --> 01:02:45,853
Don't you know what that is?

655
01:02:48,658 --> 01:02:50,455
Let me think.

656
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,187
Take your time.

657
01:02:54,197 --> 01:02:58,327
A doctor's first duty...

658
01:02:58,801 --> 01:03:00,530
A doctor's...

659
01:03:02,205 --> 01:03:03,638
I've forgotten.

660
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:07,971
A doctor's first duty
is to ask for forgiveness.

661
01:03:08,678 --> 01:03:13,081
Of course! Now I remember!

662
01:03:24,794 --> 01:03:27,456
You have been accused of guilt.

663
01:03:30,633 --> 01:03:33,898
I'll make a note that you haven't
understood the charge.

664
01:03:37,073 --> 01:03:39,041
Is it serious?

665
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,436
Unfortunately, Professor.

666
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:55,117
I have a weak heart.

667
01:03:55,224 --> 01:03:57,488
I'm an old man.

668
01:03:57,593 --> 01:04:00,426
You must be lenient with me.
It's only fair.

669
01:04:00,863 --> 01:04:03,593
There's nothing about your heart
in my papers.

670
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,599
Do you want to stop the examination?

671
01:04:05,701 --> 01:04:07,726
No, for God's sake, no!

672
01:04:15,244 --> 01:04:18,475
Please diagnose the patient.

673
01:04:32,328 --> 01:04:34,956
The patient is dead.

674
01:04:57,219 --> 01:04:59,414
What are you writing in my book?

675
01:04:59,522 --> 01:05:02,582
- My verdict.
- And that is?

676
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:04,959
That you are incompetent.

677
01:05:08,364 --> 01:05:13,700
You are also accused of some minor
but still serious offenses.

678
01:05:14,337 --> 01:05:18,774
Callousness, selfishness,
ruthlessness.

679
01:05:19,608 --> 01:05:22,577
Your wife has made the charge.

680
01:05:22,678 --> 01:05:25,010
You'll be confronted with her.

681
01:05:25,114 --> 01:05:27,605
But my wife has been dead for years!

682
01:05:27,717 --> 01:05:29,582
Do you think I'm joking?

683
01:05:32,154 --> 01:05:34,315
Please come with me.

684
01:05:34,824 --> 01:05:36,917
You have no choice.

685
01:07:57,533 --> 01:08:00,525
Many forget a woman
who has been dead for 30 years.

686
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:04,297
Some cherish
a sweet and fading picture,

687
01:08:05,241 --> 01:08:10,406
but you can recall this scene
at any time.

688
01:08:11,247 --> 01:08:13,943
Tuesday, May 1 st, 1917.

689
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:16,878
You stood on this very spot.

690
01:08:16,986 --> 01:08:21,423
And heard and saw what that man
and woman said and did.

691
01:08:36,438 --> 01:08:40,875
Now I'll go home and tell Isak.
I know just what he'll say.

692
01:08:40,976 --> 01:08:44,309
"My poor girl, I'm sorry for you."

693
01:08:46,182 --> 01:08:48,548
Just as if he were God.

694
01:08:50,186 --> 01:08:55,419
Then I'll weep and say,
"Do you really feel sorry for me?"

695
01:08:56,659 --> 01:09:01,096
He'll say, "Yes, very sorry."

696
01:09:01,697 --> 01:09:05,724
Then I'll weep even more
and ask him to forgive me.

697
01:09:05,834 --> 01:09:07,028
He'll say,

698
01:09:07,136 --> 01:09:12,438
"You mustn't beg my forgiveness.
There is nothing to forgive."

699
01:09:15,211 --> 01:09:17,941
But he doesn't mean
a word he says

700
01:09:19,915 --> 01:09:22,179
because he's cold as ice.

701
01:09:24,086 --> 01:09:26,782
And suddenly he gets very tender,

702
01:09:28,324 --> 01:09:30,815
and I scream at him that he's mad

703
01:09:32,595 --> 01:09:35,860
and that his hypocrisy makes me sick.

704
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:39,925
Then he says
he'll get me a sedative

705
01:09:40,035 --> 01:09:43,232
and that he understands
everything quite well.

706
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,601
And I tell him it's his fault
that I am as I am.

707
01:09:49,044 --> 01:09:53,174
And he looks sad
and says it <i>is</i> his fault.

708
01:09:55,084 --> 01:09:57,382
But he doesn't really care
about anything

709
01:09:58,053 --> 01:10:00,021
because he's so cold.

710
01:10:24,013 --> 01:10:25,480
Where is she?

711
01:10:25,581 --> 01:10:30,041
Gone. All are gone.

712
01:10:30,152 --> 01:10:34,088
Removed by an operation,
Professor.

713
01:10:34,723 --> 01:10:38,352
A surgical masterpiece.
No pain.

714
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,394
Nothing that bleeds or trembles.

715
01:10:41,297 --> 01:10:43,458
How silent it is.

716
01:10:44,466 --> 01:10:46,957
A perfect achievement
in its way, Professor.

717
01:10:48,003 --> 01:10:49,800
And the punishment?

718
01:10:49,905 --> 01:10:53,568
I don't know.
The usual, I suppose.

719
01:10:53,676 --> 01:10:55,234
The usual?

720
01:10:55,344 --> 01:10:57,244
Loneliness.

721
01:10:57,346 --> 01:10:59,644
Loneliness?

722
01:10:59,748 --> 01:11:02,581
Precisely.

723
01:11:03,319 --> 01:11:05,412
Is there no mercy?

724
01:11:05,521 --> 01:11:08,888
Don't ask me. I don't know.

725
01:11:29,111 --> 01:11:30,840
What's this?

726
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,547
The children wanted
to stretch their legs.

727
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:37,346
But it's still raining.

728
01:11:37,453 --> 01:11:42,117
I told them about today
and they want to honor you.

729
01:11:43,592 --> 01:11:44,616
Slept well?

730
01:11:44,727 --> 01:11:50,495
Yes, but recently I've had
the weirdest dreams,

731
01:11:55,337 --> 01:11:59,671
as if I must tell myself something
I won't listen to when I'm awake.

732
01:11:59,775 --> 01:12:01,106
What's that?

733
01:12:02,478 --> 01:12:05,606
That I'm dead.
Although I'm alive.

734
01:12:06,482 --> 01:12:08,973
You and Evald are very alike.

735
01:12:09,852 --> 01:12:11,513
So you've said.

736
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:13,850
He said the same thing.

737
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:16,314
About me?

738
01:12:16,425 --> 01:12:18,154
No. About himself.

739
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:19,727
But he's only 38.

740
01:12:22,331 --> 01:12:24,822
May I tell you about it?

741
01:12:24,933 --> 01:12:28,869
Yes, I'd be grateful.

742
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:34,808
A few months ago
I wanted to talk to Evald,

743
01:12:34,910 --> 01:12:37,003
so he drove me down to the sea.

744
01:12:37,112 --> 01:12:41,173
It was raining then too.
He sat where you sit now.

745
01:12:43,452 --> 01:12:47,821
Well, you've trapped me.
What do you want to say?

746
01:12:47,923 --> 01:12:50,153
Something unpleasant, of course.

747
01:12:51,527 --> 01:12:53,586
I wish I didn't have to.

748
01:12:53,695 --> 01:12:55,754
You have found someone else.

749
01:12:56,665 --> 01:12:58,496
Don't be childish.

750
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:03,196
You tell me in funereal tones
that you must talk to me,

751
01:13:03,305 --> 01:13:07,036
and then you find it
hard to begin.

752
01:13:07,142 --> 01:13:13,081
Come on, for heaven's sake!
Don't keep me on tenterhooks!

753
01:13:13,182 --> 01:13:15,013
I almost want to laugh now.

754
01:13:15,117 --> 01:13:17,017
Whatever do you think
I'm going to tell you?

755
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:21,317
That I've killed someone,
or stolen the faculty funds?

756
01:13:21,423 --> 01:13:23,050
I'm going to have a baby.

757
01:13:25,928 --> 01:13:27,452
Are you sure?

758
01:13:27,563 --> 01:13:29,963
The doctor told me yesterday.

759
01:13:30,065 --> 01:13:34,434
So that was the secret.

760
01:13:35,437 --> 01:13:39,737
I might as well tell you
that I intend to have this child.

761
01:13:40,943 --> 01:13:43,571
- You've made up your mind?
- Yes, I have.

762
01:14:00,062 --> 01:14:02,121
You know I don't want a child.

763
01:14:02,231 --> 01:14:04,665
You'll have to choose
between me and the child.

764
01:14:04,766 --> 01:14:07,826
- Poor Evald.
- Don't "poor Evald" me!

765
01:14:08,637 --> 01:14:12,129
It's absurd to bring children
into this world

766
01:14:12,241 --> 01:14:15,108
and think they'll be better off
than we are.

767
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:19,078
- That's just an excuse.
- Call it what you want.

768
01:14:19,181 --> 01:14:23,481
I was an unwanted child
in a hellish marriage.

769
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:26,452
Is he even sure I'm his son?

770
01:14:26,555 --> 01:14:30,218
That's no excuse
for behaving like this.

771
01:14:30,325 --> 01:14:31,849
I must be at the hospital at 3:00.

772
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,929
I have neither the time nor the desire
to discuss this any further.

773
01:14:36,999 --> 01:14:38,899
You're a coward.

774
01:14:39,468 --> 01:14:40,935
Yes.

775
01:14:41,303 --> 01:14:43,430
This life sickens me.

776
01:14:43,539 --> 01:14:45,200
I will not be forced to take on

777
01:14:45,307 --> 01:14:48,140
a responsibility that will make me live
for one day longer than I want to.

778
01:14:48,243 --> 01:14:53,112
And you know
that I mean what I say.

779
01:15:05,527 --> 01:15:07,358
I know that this is wrong.

780
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:09,794
There's neither right nor wrong.

781
01:15:09,898 --> 01:15:14,028
We act according to our needs.

782
01:15:14,136 --> 01:15:15,398
And what are they?

783
01:15:16,138 --> 01:15:20,632
Yours is a hellish desire
to live and to create life.

784
01:15:20,742 --> 01:15:21,868
And yours?

785
01:15:23,011 --> 01:15:27,004
Mine is to be dead.
Stone-dead.

786
01:15:39,895 --> 01:15:43,661
If you want to smoke a cigarette,
I don't mind.

787
01:15:48,003 --> 01:15:50,801
Why have you told me all this?

788
01:15:53,275 --> 01:15:59,214
I saw you with your mother,
and I was panic-stricken.

789
01:16:00,716 --> 01:16:02,377
I don't understand.

790
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:09,254
I thought: That's his mother.

791
01:16:10,058 --> 01:16:15,121
An old woman, cold as ice,

792
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:18,256
more forbidding than death.

793
01:16:19,534 --> 01:16:21,764
And this is her son,

794
01:16:22,304 --> 01:16:25,501
and there are light-years
between them.

795
01:16:26,508 --> 01:16:29,170
He himself says
he's a living corpse.

796
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:36,683
And Evald is growing
just as lonely, cold and dead.

797
01:16:38,387 --> 01:16:41,356
And I thought of the baby inside me.

798
01:16:42,357 --> 01:16:46,623
All along the line,
there's nothing but cold and death

799
01:16:46,728 --> 01:16:49,697
and loneliness.

800
01:16:50,599 --> 01:16:52,931
It must end somewhere.

801
01:16:54,102 --> 01:16:56,627
But you're going back to Evald!

802
01:16:58,407 --> 01:17:01,467
To say I can't agree
to his conditions.

803
01:17:01,576 --> 01:17:05,569
I want this child.
No one can take it from me.

804
01:17:05,681 --> 01:17:08,115
Not even the man
I love most of all.

805
01:17:11,586 --> 01:17:13,611
Can I help you?

806
01:17:13,722 --> 01:17:15,189
No one can help me.

807
01:17:16,792 --> 01:17:19,852
We are too old.
Things have gone too far.

808
01:17:20,796 --> 01:17:23,629
What happened after your talk?

809
01:17:23,732 --> 01:17:26,200
Nothing.
I left him the next day.

810
01:17:26,735 --> 01:17:28,828
Hasn't he gotten in touch with you?

811
01:17:30,772 --> 01:17:35,505
- I don't want us to get...
- To get what?

812
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:39,873
Like those two in the car today.

813
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:44,278
I was just thinking of them.

814
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:48,312
It reminded me of my own marriage.

815
01:17:49,057 --> 01:17:50,888
But we love each other.

816
01:17:50,992 --> 01:17:53,460
<i>Long may he live</i>
<i>Long may he live</i>

817
01:17:53,562 --> 01:17:56,395
<i>May he live to be</i>
<i>a hundred years old</i>

818
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:01,601
We heard you're celebrating
a grand occasion today.

819
01:18:01,703 --> 01:18:05,901
With these simple flowers
we want to say

820
01:18:06,007 --> 01:18:10,569
that we are <i>very</i> impressed
that you've been a doctor for 50 years.

821
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:14,479
We know you must be
a very wise old man

822
01:18:15,283 --> 01:18:17,979
who knows <i>everything</i> about life

823
01:18:18,086 --> 01:18:22,523
and has learned
all the instructions by heart.

824
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:27,260
Thank you.

825
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:31,693
Now we must go on.
It's getting late.

826
01:19:00,796 --> 01:19:05,256
So you did come.
Evald and I had given up hope.

827
01:19:05,534 --> 01:19:08,298
A nice drive is relaxing, isn't it?

828
01:19:09,137 --> 01:19:12,106
You'll have to get
into your tails at once.

829
01:19:13,141 --> 01:19:16,770
Good afternoon, Marianne.
I've told Evald you're coming.

830
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:19,346
Thank you.
That was most kind.

831
01:19:20,382 --> 01:19:22,247
So you came after all, Miss Agda.

832
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:27,447
I considered it my duty.
But my pleasure's been spoiled.

833
01:19:28,757 --> 01:19:30,315
Welcome, Father.

834
01:19:31,593 --> 01:19:33,618
As you see,
I've brought Marianne with me.

835
01:19:33,728 --> 01:19:36,458
- Hello, Marianne.
- May I put my things upstairs?

836
01:19:36,565 --> 01:19:39,557
The guest room as usual, Father?

837
01:19:39,668 --> 01:19:42,034
Let me take your bag.
It's rather heavy.

838
01:19:45,941 --> 01:19:48,808
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, it was pleasant.

839
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:50,138
Who are those young people?

840
01:19:50,245 --> 01:19:52,440
I don't know. They're nice,
and they're off to Italy.

841
01:19:52,547 --> 01:19:55,516
- They seem nice.
- Yes, they're very nice.

842
01:19:55,617 --> 01:19:58,313
It's a quarter past 4:00.

843
01:20:03,425 --> 01:20:05,416
I've bought you new shoelaces.

844
01:20:14,369 --> 01:20:16,735
I'm leaving tomorrow,
so don't worry.

845
01:20:16,838 --> 01:20:19,238
- Are you going to a hotel?
- No, why?

846
01:20:19,341 --> 01:20:23,072
Can't we share the bedroom
for one more night? Unless you object.

847
01:20:23,178 --> 01:20:26,147
- Give me a hand unpacking?
- It's nice to see you.

848
01:20:26,314 --> 01:20:28,214
And unexpected.

849
01:20:28,316 --> 01:20:30,011
Same here.

850
01:20:30,118 --> 01:20:32,951
Are we going on
to the banquet afterwards?

851
01:20:33,054 --> 01:20:37,582
Yes, I'll just call Stenberg
and tell him I'll have a lady with me.

852
01:20:45,233 --> 01:20:47,360
Hurry up, Professor!

853
01:22:22,297 --> 01:22:27,234
<i>During the ceremony,</i>

854
01:22:27,335 --> 01:22:31,271
<i>my thoughts strayed</i>
<i>to the day's events,</i>

855
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:36,271
<i>and it was then I decided</i>

856
01:22:36,378 --> 01:22:39,176
<i>to write down what had happened.</i>

857
01:22:39,647 --> 01:22:45,552
<i>In this jumble of events,</i>

858
01:22:45,653 --> 01:22:49,851
<i>I seemed to discern</i>
<i>an extraordinary logic.</i>

859
01:23:15,517 --> 01:23:18,486
Did you enjoy the ceremony?

860
01:23:18,586 --> 01:23:20,315
Yes, thank you.

861
01:23:22,190 --> 01:23:23,714
Are you tired, Miss Agda?

862
01:23:23,825 --> 01:23:25,417
I won't deny it.

863
01:23:25,527 --> 01:23:27,552
Take one of my sleeping pills.

864
01:23:30,398 --> 01:23:35,301
Miss Agda, I am sorry
about this morning.

865
01:23:35,837 --> 01:23:37,771
Are you ill, Professor?

866
01:23:37,872 --> 01:23:39,806
No. Why?

867
01:23:39,908 --> 01:23:43,344
I don't like the sound of it.

868
01:23:43,978 --> 01:23:46,310
Is it so rare
for me to say I'm sorry?

869
01:23:49,017 --> 01:23:51,349
Do you want the carafe
on the table?

870
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:19,412
Thank you anyway, Professor.
Good night.

871
01:24:20,014 --> 01:24:21,743
Miss Agda,

872
01:24:23,751 --> 01:24:28,051
as we have known each other

873
01:24:28,156 --> 01:24:30,283
for so many years,

874
01:24:30,391 --> 01:24:33,883
don't you think we could call
each other Agda and Isak?

875
01:24:33,995 --> 01:24:36,657
No, I don't.

876
01:24:36,764 --> 01:24:38,061
Why not?

877
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:40,664
Have you brushed your teeth,
Professor?

878
01:24:42,537 --> 01:24:46,633
No intimacies for me, thank you.

879
01:24:46,741 --> 01:24:48,902
It's all right between us as it is.

880
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:51,945
But we are old now.

881
01:24:52,046 --> 01:24:56,813
Speak for yourself.
A woman is jealous of her reputation.

882
01:24:57,519 --> 01:25:01,751
What would people think if we
suddenly began to say Agda and Isak?

883
01:25:01,856 --> 01:25:03,790
They would make fun of us.

884
01:25:03,892 --> 01:25:07,293
Are you always right?

885
01:25:07,395 --> 01:25:09,454
Almost always.

886
01:25:09,564 --> 01:25:14,558
At our age,
we should know how to behave.

887
01:25:21,709 --> 01:25:26,043
Good night, Professor.
I'll leave the door ajar.

888
01:25:26,147 --> 01:25:30,174
You know where I am
if you want anything.

889
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:19,493
Father Isak! You were splendid
in the procession.

890
01:26:19,601 --> 01:26:21,569
We were terribly proud
to know you.

891
01:26:21,669 --> 01:26:25,628
An old girl is giving us a lift
all the way to Hamburg.

892
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:28,641
- Anders is mad about her.
- Oh, be quiet.

893
01:26:28,743 --> 01:26:30,540
We just wanted to say good-bye.

894
01:26:30,645 --> 01:26:33,079
Good-bye. And thank you
for your company.

895
01:26:35,416 --> 01:26:37,714
It's you I really love, you know.

896
01:26:37,819 --> 01:26:41,846
Today, tomorrow, always.

897
01:26:42,357 --> 01:26:44,222
I'll remember.

898
01:26:44,659 --> 01:26:47,355
Come on.

899
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,566
We have to go now.

900
01:27:00,174 --> 01:27:02,301
Let me hear from you.

901
01:27:14,422 --> 01:27:16,913
- I think Uncle is asleep.
- Evald!

902
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,022
Yes, Father?

903
01:27:20,128 --> 01:27:21,755
Are you back already?

904
01:27:23,097 --> 01:27:25,565
Marianne lost the heel on a shoe.

905
01:27:27,502 --> 01:27:29,663
So you're going to the dance?

906
01:27:30,838 --> 01:27:32,772
I suppose so.

907
01:27:33,908 --> 01:27:36,968
- How are you, Father?
- Excellent.

908
01:27:37,078 --> 01:27:39,808
- Heart all right?
- Excellent.

909
01:27:41,582 --> 01:27:43,641
Sleep well.

910
01:27:45,853 --> 01:27:48,845
Sit down a moment.

911
01:27:50,558 --> 01:27:52,458
Anything special?

912
01:27:53,761 --> 01:27:59,097
How is it to be
between you and Marianne?

913
01:28:00,568 --> 01:28:02,195
Forgive my asking.

914
01:28:02,303 --> 01:28:03,793
I don't know.

915
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:07,403
It's not my business, but...

916
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:11,935
But wouldn't it...

917
01:28:12,046 --> 01:28:14,071
I have asked her to stay with me.

918
01:28:14,182 --> 01:28:16,377
Shouldn't you... I mean...

919
01:28:16,484 --> 01:28:20,750
- I can't live without her.
- You mean alone?

920
01:28:20,855 --> 01:28:23,915
I can't live without <i>her.</i>
That's what I mean.

921
01:28:24,025 --> 01:28:25,993
Oh, I see.

922
01:28:26,094 --> 01:28:27,823
It will be as she wants.

923
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:30,924
And she...

924
01:28:31,566 --> 01:28:34,729
She says she'll think about it.

925
01:28:35,636 --> 01:28:37,570
About that debt of yours...

926
01:28:37,672 --> 01:28:39,902
Don't worry,
you'll get your money.

927
01:28:40,007 --> 01:28:42,601
That's not what I meant.

928
01:28:45,079 --> 01:28:46,444
How are you, Uncle Isak?

929
01:28:46,547 --> 01:28:48,481
Fine. Just fine.

930
01:28:48,583 --> 01:28:51,575
I lost a heel.
Will these shoes do?

931
01:28:51,686 --> 01:28:54,154
They're very nice.

932
01:28:57,091 --> 01:28:59,184
Thanks for coming with me.

933
01:29:02,530 --> 01:29:05,431
I like you, Marianne.

934
01:29:06,067 --> 01:29:08,365
I like you too, Uncle Isak.

935
01:29:16,844 --> 01:29:21,008
<i>If I have been worried</i>
<i>or sad during the day,</i>

936
01:29:21,516 --> 01:29:27,079
<i>it often calms me</i>
<i>to recall childhood memories.</i>

937
01:29:28,089 --> 01:29:30,455
<i>I did so on this evening too.</i>

938
01:29:42,336 --> 01:29:45,703
Isak, there are no
wild strawberries left.

939
01:29:46,441 --> 01:29:48,671
Auntie wants you
to look for your papa.

940
01:29:48,776 --> 01:29:51,472
We'll sail around and meet you
at the other side of the island.

941
01:29:51,913 --> 01:29:56,282
I can't find either Papa or Mama.

942
01:29:56,884 --> 01:29:59,478
Come, I'll help you.
