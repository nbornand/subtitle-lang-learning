1
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,595
Let's see what you got.

2
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,478
I need more runners.
I can't write the business fast enough.

3
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,391
You've got to see Granger.

4
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,797
8720. Yeah.

5
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,789
Yeah. Hold it a minute. Beat it, Mottola!

6
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,030
Mr. Granger? Chicago's on the line.

7
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,117
This is Combs. Why haven't you called?
Everyone else is in.

8
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,236
We had problems
with the law this morning.

9
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,675
The mayor promised
to get tough on the rackets.

10
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,558
He shut everybody down
for two hours to make it look good.

11
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,596
Nothing serious. It just puts us behind.

12
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,795
Been making your payoffs?

13
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,072
Yes! He does this every year.
There's nothing to worry about.

14
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,114
<i>Finish your count and get it up here.
I don't want to be here all night.</i>

15
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,909
The man's going to be real happy.
We cleared over $10,000 this week.

16
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,149
<i>- We cleared $22,000 here.
- You got the whole Chicago South Side.</i>

17
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,073
How do you expect my eight lousy spots
to compete with that?

18
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,517
They did $14,000 in Evanston,
$16,500 in Gary and $20,000 in Cicero.

19
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,477
Looks like you're bringing up the rear.

20
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,313
I just got the count.
I'll put the take on the 4:15.

21
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,197
We'll be waiting.

22
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,752
Mottola!

23
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,910
Take this up to Chicago on the 4:15.

24
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,634
They'll be waiting for it
at the clearinghouse.

25
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,234
And don't stop for any entertainment.
Get a cab over on Seventh.

26
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,319
Cut it out!

27
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:57,991
8720.

28
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,238
Hey, you there! Stop!
Hey, you! Stop that man!

29
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,399
Stop him! He's got my wallet!
Stop him! Stop that man!

30
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,999
He's got all of my money!

31
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,638
Stop him!

32
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,277
Goddamn nigger-lover!

33
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,550
I'll get you someday for this! Sucker egg!

34
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,957
Don't let him get away!
He's got my wallet!

35
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,632
He's got all my money!

36
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,554
- My wallet! He's got my wallet!
- We got it!

37
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,990
What happened?
Did he get you with the knife?

38
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,709
- You need a doctor. I'll call a cop.
- No, no! No cops!

39
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,399
- You wanted by the law?
- No, it's okay.

40
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,398
Are you nuts, carrying a wad like that
in this neighborhood?

41
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,314
Thanks. I'm obliged to you.
I've got to get going.

42
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,637
You ain't going nowhere on this leg.

43
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,269
I've got to. Got to run some slots
in West Bend for a mob here.

44
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,594
I got a little behind in the payoffs.
They think I've been holding out on them.

45
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,439
They gave me until 4:00
to come up with the cash.

46
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,476
If they don't get it, I'm dead.

47
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,835
It don't look good, Gramps.
It's almost 4:00 now.

48
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,196
I'll give you and your friend $100
to deliver it for me.

49
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,476
I don't know.
The mug that hit you is mad at me.

50
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,551
What if he's waiting around the corner?

51
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,473
He won't know you're carrying it.
You've got to help me.

52
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,995
I'm sorry. I'll help you get to a doctor, but
I ain't about to walk into no knife for you.

53
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,278
How about you? All you got to do
is put it in the door slot.

54
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,796
- I'll give you the whole $100.
- What makes you think you can trust him?

55
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,668
Butt out! I gave him back the wallet.
How far is this place?

56
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,594
1811 Mason. Put it in box 3-C.
You won't have no trouble.

57
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,510
There's $5,000 there...

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,672
...and here's $100 for you.

59
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,272
Okay, I'll make your drop for you.
And don't worry, you can trust me.

60
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,598
If those goons search you,
you won't get far carrying it there.

61
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,796
- What'll we do?
- You got a bag or something?

62
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,757
How about a handkerchief?

63
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,070
- Here's a handkerchief!
- Give it to me.

64
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,354
- Give me the money.
- Just hurry, will you?

65
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,390
You got any more? Better give it all to me
if you want to keep it.

66
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,159
They think I've been holding out.

67
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,152
My wife got sick and I had to pay the bill.

68
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,714
Stuff it down your pants here.
Like that. Got it?

69
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,669
Hurry, will you?

70
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,638
Ain't a tough guy in the world
that will frisk you there.

71
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,755
Thanks.

72
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,510
Where to?

73
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,909
- Which way is Mason?
- Twenty blocks south.

74
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,833
- Go north, Joliet Station, fast!
- Right.

75
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,639
What's so funny?

76
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,314
I just made the world's easiest $5,000!

77
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,040
- Come on, Luther! Come on!
- Hold on, man!

78
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,394
Hustle!

79
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,591
In here!

80
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,031
Man, was that beautiful!

81
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,597
I thought for sure he was on to us.

82
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,831
No, you had him all the way. All the way!

83
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,271
Good God! We're millionaires.

84
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,796
- Did you know he was that loaded?
- Hell, no!

85
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,634
I just cut into him. I would've settled
for pawning one of them shoes.

86
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,158
Oh, God!

87
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,400
Let's get out of here.
We'll split it up tonight.

88
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,999
Hiya, Marge!

89
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,554
- Hi, kid.
- Hi, Hooker. She's on stage.

90
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,350
Hi, Hooker. Getting married or something?

91
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,557
Get used to it, Leonard.
I'm going to look this good from now on.

92
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,189
- What do you say, Ed?
- Hi, Hooker.

93
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,634
Are you getting married or something?

94
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,152
For Christ's sake, did you hear that?

95
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,993
Harry drops four beats
in the middle of my goddamn routine!

96
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,913
- How long do I have to put up with that?
- Leonard, you're on.

97
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,914
You want to get out of here tonight?
I got some dough.

98
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,878
I can't. I got a 10:00 show. I need the $5.

99
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,790
I'll spend $50 on you.

100
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,479
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

101
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,835
Okay.

102
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,355
...opens up his pants,
the duck sticks his head out.

103
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,908
One lady says to the other,
"See what I see?"

104
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,798
She says, "So what?
You've seen one, you've seen them all."

105
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,792
She says, "Yes, but this one
is eating my popcorn."

106
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,630
You see that guy Harry, he can't keep time.

107
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,678
Supposing there's
some Hollywood movie agent out there.

108
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,035
All those years of training
right down the drain.

109
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,509
Ain't seen you in months.
Thought you took a fall.

110
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,909
Just a little hard times.
Everything's jake now.

111
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,672
How about a ten spot on the line?

112
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,593
There's a lot of action there on 28th Street.
Pay you $35.

113
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,113
$3,000 on the red.

114
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,158
- $3,000?
- Are you nuts?

115
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,469
No, I feel lucky.

116
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,268
Hooker, I can't accept that.
It's too big a bet.

117
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,510
- There's a house limit.
- Take it.

118
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,232
- But Hooker here...
- Take it!

119
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,949
Twenty-two, black.

120
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,472
Tough luck, kid.

121
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,792
Lucky for me it came up black.

122
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,599
A fella could get in trouble here,
losing a bet like that.

123
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,716
Listen, Jimmy, can't we do it again?

124
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,871
Don't worry about it. There's always more
where that came from.

125
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,793
"Don't worry about it," he says. $3,000!

126
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,190
Thanks, Hooker.

127
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,669
Comes in here with $50
he's going to spend on me!

128
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,516
- Thanks for the evening.
- It's not over yet.

129
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,114
Next time you want to spend $50
on me, mail it.

130
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,349
They found Mottola drunk in a dive
in Joliet. He never got on the train.

131
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,398
I don't want to hear about his day.
What happened to the money?

132
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,631
He lost it to a couple of con artists
on his way out of the spot.

133
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,870
- How much?
- $11,000.

134
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,353
I better get on the phone to New York...

135
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,359
...see what the big mick
wants to do about it.

136
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,310
I have a pretty good idea, though.

137
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,354
- Doyle, can I talk to you?
- I'm busy, Floyd.

138
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,036
It's important. We had a little trouble
in Chicago today.

139
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,953
One of our runners got hit for $11,000.

140
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,315
What makes you think
he just didn't pocket it?

141
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,313
We checked his story with a tipster.
He was cleaned by two grifters.

142
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,433
They working for anybody?

143
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,751
I don't know. Could be.
We're running that down now.

144
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,036
Have some local people take care of them.
Nothing fancy.

145
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,759
We've got to discourage this kind of thing.

146
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,999
You follow?

147
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,712
Johnny Hooker!

148
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,673
- If you ain't a sharper in them linens!
- 'Evening, Louise.

149
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,715
Hey, Ma!

150
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,554
If I didn't know you better,
I'd swear you had some class.

151
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,358
Luther said you was something
to see today!

152
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,555
I don't know, Alva.

153
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,428
I got to get faster tying that bundle.
I still give them too much time to think.

154
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,479
Bushwah! I used to make that switch
with slower hands than you got.

155
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,519
'Course, the Up and Down Broadway
was my best game.

156
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,519
Me and Luther didn't make much on it,
but it wasn't so touchy.

157
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,309
Them marks can beat you up bad
when they catch you making that switch.

158
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,470
Come on, Leroy. We'll be late for church.

159
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,120
Ma, they were closing in
on Machine Gun Kelly!

160
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,679
Who you rooting for anyhow?

161
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,318
- Hey, Hooker!
- Can't help you, Leroy.

162
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,072
- You can't beat the house.
- Nuts!

163
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,550
- Since when do you go to church at night?
- Since they started late bingo.

164
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,837
I'll ask the Lord for some of that cash
while He's still paying off.

165
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,639
Luther, look in on the baby
from time to time, will you?

166
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,678
- You too, Louise?
- Child, yeah, got to go pray. See you.

167
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,358
Hey, Erie.

168
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,637
- Gimme! Gimme, gimme!
- There's your cut.

169
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,437
Guy turned out to be an oil well.

170
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,398
- Which way'd he go?
- Due north. He was gonna take it all.

171
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,438
The bastard.
He can blow his nose all the way.

172
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,234
There you go, Luther. Six G's.

173
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,634
- You're late. Where have you been?
- I had a couple of appointments.

174
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,831
How much did you lose?

175
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,029
- All of it.
- In one goddamn night?

176
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,991
Why are you spraying money
around like that?

177
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,833
- You could've been nailed!
- There were no dicks there.

178
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,309
But you're a con man,
and you blew it like a pimp!

179
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,868
- Didn't I teach you to be no pimp.
- What's eating you?

180
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,678
I've blown money before.

181
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,196
- No class grifter would've done it.
- You think my play is bad?

182
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,992
I think you're the best.

183
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,348
I wouldn't be getting out, otherwise.

184
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,551
- What are you talking about?
- I'm getting too old for this racket.

185
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,393
You hang on too long
and you start embarrassing yourself.

186
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,630
We just took off on the biggest score ever.

187
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,518
It's nothing compared to what
you could make on the big con.

188
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,158
But you played the big con.

189
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,472
You told me yourself it was some
dumb game for mama's boys and flakes.

190
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,036
Hell, I never played no big con.
I hung around and picked up a few things.

191
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,397
Ain't no rich boys gonna trust
a hungry nigger enough to be conned.

192
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,594
But I'll tell you...

193
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,874
...I've been looking for this one
all my life, Johnny.

194
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,275
Now I have a chance
to step out when I'm ahead.

195
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,998
Come on!
What would you do with yourself?

196
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,232
I have a brother in K.C.,
runs a freight outlet.

197
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,590
I can go halfsies with him.

198
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,471
It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.

199
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,233
I got an old friend in Chicago
named Henry Gondorff.

200
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,793
I want you to look him up.
There ain't a better inside man alive.

201
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,913
- He'll teach you all you got to know.
- To hell with that.

202
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,954
I want to work with you.

203
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,636
I'm out, Johnny.

204
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,392
Yeah, sure. If that's the way you want it.

205
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,917
That's the way I want it.

206
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,117
How do you like that Coleman?
After five years.

207
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,111
- He knew he was holding you back.
- Yeah, but we were partners.

208
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,760
If it weren't for Luther,
I'd still be hustling pinball.

209
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,353
I don't need more than what I got.

210
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,512
You won't have anything
if you don't lay off the games of chance.

211
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,433
- There's a depression on.
- There's always a depression on.

212
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,795
If you saved a little,
you wouldn't have to grift.

213
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,758
- I like grifting.
- You could buy yourself some things.

214
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,239
- What?
- New clothes, a car.

215
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,470
I got clothes,
and I don't know how to drive.

216
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,232
What else do you got to sell?

217
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,474
Hey, Hooker! Come on, you son of a...

218
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,279
Hi there, Snyder.

219
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,876
What's the matter? Things a little slow
down at the bunco department?

220
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,279
Somebody lose at dominoes?

221
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,033
You scored blood money today,
and you need a friend.

222
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,351
Go find yourself a shoplifter to roll.

223
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,509
You got the wrong guy, pal.
I've been home with the flu all day.

224
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,109
- Stake out my toilet if you want.
- Keep talking!

225
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,075
I'll tell you what you did, smart boy.

226
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,035
You tied into a loaded mark
on 47th across from Maxie's.

227
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,193
You and Coleman played the switch
for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.

228
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,913
If he hadn't been a numbers runner for
Doyle Lonnegan, it would've been perfect.

229
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,392
You're crazy.

230
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,114
I ain't stupid enough
to play for no racket's money.

231
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,034
Not intentionally, maybe.
That don't cut no ice with Lonnegan.

232
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,240
- He'll swat you like a fly.
- Yeah, well...

233
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,672
...I'll square it with the fixer.

234
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,433
Nobody can buy you a prayer
if I put the finger on you.

235
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,111
Now, I figure your end of the score
was at least three G's.

236
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,917
- I want two, no matter what it was.
- My take was only one.

237
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,753
Then you'll have to come up
with another $1,000 somewhere.

238
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,193
All right.

239
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,349
You're a smart egg, Hooker.

240
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,794
No sense getting dead over $2,000.

241
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,314
Relax, Erie. I'll bill you.

242
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,109
- I thought you blew all your money.
- I did.

243
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,355
I gave him counterfeit. They'll spot it
the first place he tries to spend it.

244
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,556
Are you crazy,
giving him counterfeit money?

245
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,397
Wait up! Where you going?

246
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,677
What the hell are you gonna do
if Snyder puts the finger on you?

247
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,399
- You're committing suicide, kid.
- What's the difference?

248
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,393
If Snyder knows, so does everybody else.
He never gets anything first.

249
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,712
Hey, listen to me.
Don't go back to your place tonight.

250
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,951
Don't go anyplace you usually go.
You hear me?

251
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,470
Damn! There's no answer at Luther's.

252
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,468
Look, you better get out of town
or something.

253
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,596
Lady, let go!

254
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,674
- Ma'am! Ma'am!
- I want my nickel back for that telephone!

255
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,079
No, sir. Nobody here did.

256
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,472
1521 North Bryant.

257
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,389
- Is he dead?
- I don't know. There was a big fight.

258
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,199
I don't know.
Somebody must've pushed him.

259
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,473
- Jesus!
- Luther!

260
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,833
- Luther!
- Jesus!

261
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,034
God! No!

262
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,754
Luther!

263
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,149
What happened?

264
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,118
Who would do such a thing to you, Luther?

265
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,388
Come on! Let's get out of here.

266
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,591
Come on! If Snyder catches you here,
you're dead!

267
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,470
- Get out of here!
- Out of the way.

268
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,391
Help me! Help me!

269
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,995
Excuse me.

270
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,277
I'm looking for a guy
named Henry Gondorff.

271
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,237
- Do you know him?
- No.

272
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,796
You sure?

273
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,799
Beat it.

274
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,439
Luther Coleman sent me.

275
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,711
- Are you Hooker?
- Yeah.

276
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,832
Why didn't you say so?

277
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,750
We heard about Luther last night.

278
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,229
Come on.

279
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,429
I thought maybe you were a cop
or something.

280
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,199
It's the room in the back.

281
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,709
He wasn't expecting you so soon, though.

282
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,114
Thanks.

283
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,951
The great Henry Gondorff.

284
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,676
Turn it off!

285
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,439
Are you sober?

286
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,838
Turn it off, will you?

287
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,714
Glad to meet you, kid.
You're a real horse's ass.

288
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,360
Luther said I could learn
something from you.

289
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,679
I already know how to drink.

290
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,871
Sorry about Luther.

291
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,038
He was the best street worker I ever saw.

292
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,195
He had you down as a big-timer.
What happened?

293
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,558
I conned a senator from Florida
on a stock deal.

294
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,356
A real lop-ear. Thought he was gonna
take over General Electric.

295
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,592
Some chanteuse woke him, though,
and he put the feds on me.

296
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,312
You mean you blew it.

297
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,355
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.

298
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,040
He didn't tell me you was a screw-up either.

299
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,034
You played any big cons since then?

300
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,438
I lammed around a bunch of bohunk towns,
one kick ahead of the G-men.

301
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,838
Would be still,
if Billie hadn't set me up here.

302
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,998
Don't kid yourself, friend. I still know how.

303
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,428
Are you going to stay for breakfast,
or do you already know how to eat?

304
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,872
I picked something up along the way.

305
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,913
Is Lonnegan after you too?

306
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,314
I don't know. I ain't seen anybody.

307
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,517
You never do, kid.

308
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,469
Doyle?

309
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,315
Yeah.

310
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,957
We just talked to Chicago.

311
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,839
They got one of the grifters last night.
A nigger.

312
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,396
- How about the other one?
- They're still looking for him.

313
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,791
- Who did Combs put on it?
- He gave it to Riley and Cole.

314
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,356
They staked out the other guy's place
last night, but he never showed.

315
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,556
They figure maybe he skipped town.

316
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,558
Do you want to keep after him?

317
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,990
You see that fella in the red sweater?

318
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,919
His name's Danny McCoy.

319
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,675
Works a few of the protection rackets
when he's waiting for something better.

320
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,273
Danny and I have known each other
since we were six.

321
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,394
Take a good look at that face, Floyd.

322
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,596
Because if he ever finds out
I can be beat by one lousy grifter...

323
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,991
...I'll have to kill him and every hood...

324
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,799
...who wants to muscle in
on my Chicago operation.

325
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,031
- You follow?
- Yes, sir.

326
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,274
Good lad.

327
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,434
You feeling all right this morning, Henry?

328
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,950
Yeah, fine.

329
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,628
You mind opening up the round
a little early today?

330
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,711
We got some business
coming in before hours.

331
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,469
- Sure.
- Check the main gearing, will you?

332
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,395
Man O' War started rattling yesterday
and threw a kid on its head.

333
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,749
Great little countess, that Billie.
She runs a spiffy house up there too.

334
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,149
You plan to spend
the rest of your life here?

335
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,311
I could do a lot worse.

336
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,280
Listen, am I gonna learn to play
the big con or not?

337
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,358
- What's your hurry?
- I want to play for Lonnegan.

338
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,917
You know anything about the guy?

339
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,719
Yeah, he croaked Luther.
Anything else I got to know?

340
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,554
All right.

341
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,119
He runs a numbers racket on the South
Side, owns a packinghouse, a few banks...

342
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,953
Yeah, and half the politicians
in New York and Chicago.

343
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,993
Not a fix in this world will cool him out
if he blows on you.

344
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,672
- I'll get him anyway.
- Why?

345
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,760
'Cause I don't know enough
about killing to kill him.

346
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,078
You can't do it alone, you know.

347
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,469
It takes some guys and money
to make them look good.

348
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,915
- I know lots of guys.
- It's not like playing winos.

349
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,752
- You can't outrun Lonnegan.
- I don't play for winos.

350
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,956
You've got to keep his con
after you take his money.

351
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,508
- He can't know you took him.
- You're scared of him.

352
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,149
Right down to my socks, buster.

353
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,317
This guy would kill a grifter...

354
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,392
...over a chunk of money that
wouldn't support him for two days.

355
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,192
You're going to go for him.

356
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,077
I don't want a hothead looking to get even,
coming back saying...

357
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,754
..."It ain't enough."
'Cause it's all we're gonna get.

358
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,672
Can you get a mob together?

359
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,877
After what happened to Luther,
I can't get more than 300 guys.

360
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,190
Luther said you learn fast.
I hope he's right.

361
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,155
Lonnegan gets most of his income
from the numbers...

362
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,232
...but he's putting more money
in his savings-and-loan business.

363
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,151
- Think he's moving out of the racket?
- No.

364
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,117
He owns most of the stock and it's traded.

365
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,317
My guess is he's just trying
to build himself a respectable image.

366
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,628
He came out of Five Points...

367
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,553
...but he's telling everybody
he was born in Forest Hills.

368
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,119
He knows the market, though.

369
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,555
I don't think we can take him
on a stocks deal.

370
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,235
What about the numbers?

371
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,233
It's run out of a packinghouse on 14th
by a guy named Combs.

372
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,393
Lonnegan comes out every three weeks
to check on it, but...

373
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,597
...he stays away from the day-to-day stuff
in case it's raided.

374
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,638
These are two of Combs'
favorite torpedoes: Riley and Cole.

375
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,835
You ever seen them?

376
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,468
- No.
- They're the ones who hit Luther.

377
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,111
They also got the numbers runner
you conned.

378
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,239
A guy named Mottola. Found him
in a quarry with a knife in his eye.

379
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,953
Lonnegan's had seven or eight people
rubbed on his way up.

380
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,397
His pattern is to get close to a racket boss,
learn the operation, then move in on it.

381
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,109
He's done it to Gorman,
O'Donnell, Buchalman.

382
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,791
He took the numbers from Sharkey.
All four of these guys are dead.

383
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,551
He's vindictive as hell, Henry.

384
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,394
Kills for pride. Doesn't add up
he'd let Hooker get away from him.

385
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,835
You see anything, kid, you let us know.

386
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,271
If they put you on the spot,
we got to fold the con. You got that?

387
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,990
Yeah. You sure it's got to be
one of these two guys?

388
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,992
No. They're just the only ones we know of.

389
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,038
Time.

390
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,913
Set me up five more beers,
will you, Danny?

391
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,755
- You the owner here?
- That's right.

392
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,634
Lt. Snyder, Bunco.

393
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,990
That's a Joliet badge, Snyder.
Don't cut much up here.

394
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,790
Looking for a guy on the lam
for counterfeiting.

395
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,916
- Thought he might be here.
- Don't think so.

396
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,514
I know everyone in the place.
I bounce the lamsters.

397
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,431
All right if I look around in here?

398
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,115
No, but you're welcome
to a free beer before you go.

399
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,752
I don't really need your permission.

400
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,157
I don't know what to do with this guy.

401
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,755
He's an Irishman who doesn't drink,
doesn't smoke and doesn't chase dames.

402
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,876
He's a grand knight
in the Knights of Columbus.

403
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,279
He only goes out to play faro.

404
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,352
Sometimes plays 20 hours at a time.
Just him against the house.

405
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,476
- Roulette, craps?
- He won't touch them.

406
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,429
The croupier at Gilman's says
he never plays anything he can't win.

407
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,436
Sports?

408
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,593
He likes to be seen with fighters,
but doesn't go to the fights or bet on them.

409
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,593
Jesus. Does he do anything
where he's not alone?

410
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,598
Just poker.

411
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,911
And he cheats.

412
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,671
Pretty good at it, too.

413
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,836
Where does he play?

414
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,878
The porters say he runs a braced game
on the Century Limited...

415
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,714
...when he comes here from New York.
$100 minimum, straight poker.

416
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,713
A lot of high rollers ride that train
just to play him.

417
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,398
That sounds good, J.J.

418
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,753
Which way are the rooms?

419
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,991
Who told you this guy was in here?

420
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,548
Nobody. I just know
what kind of woman he likes.

421
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,069
I'm gonna check all the joy houses
till I find him.

422
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,435
Maybe I could help you
if you tell me his name.

423
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,598
I doubt it. Which way are the rooms?

424
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,630
Right through there.
But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

425
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,475
- What are you gonna do, call the cops?
- I don't have to.

426
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,470
You'd be busting in
on the chief of police just up the hall.

427
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,559
We'll play it out here.
A huge duke is too simple.

428
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,234
With no fix, we'll need a con
with a sure-fire blow-off.

429
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,515
I think we ought to play this guy
on the payoff.

430
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,478
It's the tightest game we got.
It's not all over the papers yet.

431
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,030
Lonnegan is a fast egg. He's not going
to sit still for a standard play.

432
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,032
What does that leave us?
We can't con the payoff to a banker.

433
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,149
We'll use the wire.

434
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,234
Haven't known a player
didn't wanna beat the ponies.

435
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,710
- The wire's been out of date for ten years.
- That's why he won't know it.

436
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,552
I'm not sure I know it.

437
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,756
It'll take two of us working the inside.

438
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,356
Any objections to Hooker as second man?

439
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,273
All right. We'll give Lonnegan the hook
on the train and play him here.

440
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,271
Do you think I can get in that poker game?

441
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,920
Just show up with a lot of money
and look like a sucker.

442
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,069
I also gotta win.

443
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,431
By the way, any of you guys
been passing bad money lately?

444
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,953
If he comes again,
stall him so I can get a look at him.

445
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,792
Fella named Stenner had this place
until about six months ago...

446
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,632
...but he had to give it up.

447
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,990
It doesn't look so good,
but maybe you can fix it up a little bit.

448
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,277
Watch your step when you come in.
There's a dip down to the left.

449
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,360
- How does it look, Eddie?
- It looks all right, Kid.

450
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,153
- It's big enough, and it's off the street.
- I don't know.

451
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,949
It's kind of short notice. I'm not sure
we can get it done by Saturday.

452
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,039
Got to. Gondorff's riding the mark down
from New York on the Century.

453
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,471
We'll take it. Do you manage that building
at the end of the alley?

454
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,358
- For 15 years.
- I'll need a corner room facing this way.

455
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,635
- How much a week?
- Only rents by the month.

456
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,278
$250 for the two of them.

457
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,189
- Last time I expect to see you down here.
- Never heard of the place.

458
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,635
It's been a while
since I stocked the wire store.

459
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,672
Not many mobs playing that anymore.

460
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,349
All we'll need is the bookie setup for now.

461
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,917
I'll rent you everything
I got in the warehouse for $2,000.

462
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,953
That'll give you phones, cages,
blackboards and ticker gear.

463
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,118
If you want a counter and bar,
that's another $1,000.

464
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,632
- That's pretty steep, Benny.
- Gondorff's still a hot item.

465
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,632
- Where would I be if he gets hit?
- Just give us what you can.

466
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,835
We'll send a truck.

467
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,480
How do you want to work this?
Flat rate or percentage?

468
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,835
- Who's the mark?
- Doyle Lonnegan.

469
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,119
Flat rate.

470
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,434
The guy in the black hat with the gimp.

471
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,471
He's not as tough as he thinks.

472
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,472
Neither are we.

473
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,472
- Mr. Shaw?
- Right.

474
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,754
You wanted to see me?

475
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,071
I hear there's a friendly poker game
on this train. Know about it?

476
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,559
- A little.
- Thank you, sir.

477
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,995
- Can you get me in that game?
- I don't know.

478
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,752
There's usually a waiting list.

479
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,350
That'll get you first alternate, sir.

480
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,398
I'll see what I can do.

481
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,470
Twist!

482
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,518
- Patty, me boy! How are you?
- How are you, Twist?

483
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,509
Champ, you're looking like a million!
Good to see you!

484
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,068
Goldie, you old son of a gun.

485
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,118
I saw the Kid in Denver.
He says to say hello to you.

486
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,316
Joiner, are you still working those shapes?

487
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,277
Any number you want, Twist!

488
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,999
- Good to see you again.
- Okay, Lacey. Good to see you.

489
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,150
- It's good to see you.
- Dukey, how are you?

490
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,116
Come on in.

491
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,873
- When did you get back in town?
- A couple of days ago.

492
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,030
You heard about Luther Coleman,
didn't you?

493
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,873
Yes. The boys were passing the hat
for Alva and the kids.

494
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,635
- I never seen the guys so worked up.
- Don't worry about it, Dukey.

495
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,389
We're gonna send
a little calling card of our own.

496
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,553
Gondorff is setting up a wire store.
I'll need a 20-man boost right away.

497
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,917
I got plenty of talent out there tonight.
Take your pick. Lace!

498
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,152
This is a tough one.
These boys have got to be the quill.

499
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,876
Get me the sheet. Let's see who's in town.

500
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,430
Patty, give me the sheet.

501
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,748
Sure.

502
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,397
Gondorff's already on...

503
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,957
Twist, you know this guy?

504
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,998
No, I never saw him before.

505
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,629
He's a dick, though.

506
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,316
Hello, Snyder.

507
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,914
- What are you doing up here?
- I'm on vacation.

508
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,510
You seen that friend of yours lately?

509
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,589
No, no. He packed it in.
Enrolled in detective school.

510
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,313
If you see him...

511
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,113
...you tell him he better pay up
before I get to him.

512
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,152
That son of a bitch.

513
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,593
Thanks, Lace.

514
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,352
Let's see what we got here.

515
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,115
Horse Face Lee, Slim Miller...

516
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,789
...Suitcase Murphy and the Big Alabama
are in from New Orleans.

517
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,828
Crying Jonesy and the Boone Kid
from Denver.

518
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,316
Dippy Burke and Limehouse Chappie
from New York.

519
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,755
These and the guys outside should
give you 30 or more to choose from.

520
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,193
Good, Dukey.

521
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,840
Have them down at Stenner's
old pool hall before 6:00.

522
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,151
- We'll run the route tonight.
- Okay, Twist, but...

523
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,676
...if this thing blows up, remember,
I can't do you no good downtown.

524
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,149
Gondorff is federal.

525
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,555
Dukey, if this thing blows up...

526
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,354
...the feds will be the least
of our problems.

527
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,155
Yeah?

528
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,396
- You in?
- Yeah, I think so.

529
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,119
I gave the kayducer a C-note.
Did you find out the deck?

530
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,839
He usually plays with a Tallyho Fan
or a Tallyho Circle.

531
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,433
I got you one of each.

532
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,432
He likes to cold-deck low, eights or nines.

533
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,276
That's nice work, J.J. Here.

534
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,437
- I'm sorry.
- Don't mention it, ma'am.

535
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,028
She picked him clean. He never missed it.

536
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,278
My God, it looks like
he's expecting a big night.

537
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,351
Must be $15,000-$20,000 here.

538
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,670
- He's waiting for you in the card room.
- Let him wait.

539
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,798
Just worry about your end, kid.

540
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,992
If we ever get to it.

541
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,474
Excuse me.

542
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,072
You sure you checked this guy out?

543
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,549
He seemed like a pleasant man,
a lot of cash on him.

544
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,598
$200 suit, expensive luggage.
I'll vouch for him.

545
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,150
- Why isn't he here then?
- Don't worry. He'll be here.

546
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,119
All right.

547
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,633
What're you doing?

548
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,955
Always drink gin with a mark, kid.
He can't tell if you cut it.

549
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,039
- $2,000 for you, Mr. Clayton.
- Thank you.

550
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,475
All right, gentlemen.
Should we not wait for him?

551
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,915
- Let's go.
- I think that's a good idea.

552
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,912
Mr. Clemens, give me the cards.

553
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,670
Sorry I'm late, guys. I was taking a crap.

554
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,033
The name's Shaw.

555
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,113
Mr. Shaw, meet Mr. Jameson
from Chicago.

556
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,389
Mr. Lombard from Philadelphia.

557
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,040
- And Mr. Lonnegan from New York.
- Pleased to meet you.

558
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,394
Mr. Clayton, Pittsburgh.

559
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,515
Any of you guys want to make a little book
in Chicago, I'm the guy to see.

560
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,399
Game is straight poker...

561
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,878
...$100 minimum, table stakes.

562
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,719
Mr. Shaw, this is a gentleman's game.
We assume you're all good for your debts.

563
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,236
- How much would you like, Mr. Shaw?
- I'll start with $5,000.

564
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,231
We usually require a tie at this table.
If you don't have one, we can get you one.

565
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,870
Hey, that'd be real nice of you,
Mr. Lonneman.

566
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,635
Lonnegan.

567
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,552
Name's Curly Jackson.
Worked for Gad Bryan out of Baldwin.

568
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,868
Jackson?

569
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,871
Jackson, Jackson. Oh, yeah.

570
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,153
Ever play the wire, Curly?

571
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,994
Roped for it long ago. I can shill,
mark board, anything you want.

572
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,239
I don't run with riffraff,
and I only drink on weekends.

573
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,555
Me specialty's an Englishman.

574
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,956
We got a rack of suits over there.
Pick yourself a nice tweed one.

575
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,708
That's all right. I've got all my own stuff.

576
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,114
Doyle?

577
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,994
One.

578
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,509
Bill?

579
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,318
I'll take one.

580
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,273
- Shaw?
- Three.

581
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,075
And the dealer will take one.

582
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,154
Bet $500.

583
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,639
I'll call.

584
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,153
Call and raise.

585
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,789
- $300.
- I'm out.

586
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,753
Fold.

587
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,919
Your three...

588
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,753
...and raise...

589
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,230
...$500.

590
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,112
That's eight to me.

591
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,194
Call.

592
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,714
Jacks on top.

593
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,594
Beats me.

594
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,634
Three tens.

595
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,313
Tough luck, Lonnihan.

596
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,198
That's what you get for playing
with your head up your ass.

597
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,874
Couple more like that
and we can all go to bed early.

598
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,393
The name's Lonnegan. Doyle Lonnegan.

599
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,712
You'll remember that,
or you'll get yourself another game.

600
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,553
You follow?

601
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,153
Bring it right up here!

602
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:45,037
Eddie, we brought you a tap
into Moe Anenberg's wire.

603
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:49,033
You'll get race results, odds,
scratches, pole positions, everything.

604
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,315
And just as fast
as Western Union gets them.

605
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,995
- Does J.J. know how to use that thing?
- All he's got to do is read.

606
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,110
The name is Joe Erie.

607
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,511
Joe Erie.

608
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,148
- You played for any particular mobs?
- No.

609
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,195
- You ever play the wire before, Erie?
- No.

610
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,959
I never played no big con before, but...

611
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,392
...Luther Coleman was a friend of mine,
and I thought maybe...

612
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,958
...there'd be something I could do.

613
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,550
You got that nose
in Duke Boudreau's tonight?

614
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,755
Yeah.

615
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,072
You got moxie, Erie. Get yourself a suit.

616
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,593
Thanks.

617
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,479
I'll bet three.

618
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,158
Call and raise $200.

619
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,915
Call.

620
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,753
- No.
- I'm out.

621
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,155
Call.

622
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,719
Aces over.

623
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,313
Three cowboys.

624
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,831
All red, queen high.

625
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,072
- Well, that finishes me.
- Don't worry about it, pal.

626
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,355
They wouldn't have let you in
if you weren't a chump!

627
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,510
Lombard'll be joining you in a few minutes.

628
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:24,954
I've had enough of this game
and quite enough of this company.

629
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,991
Check me out, Clemens.

630
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,076
I guess that just leaves the three of us.

631
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,789
Yes, Mr. Shaw. That just leaves us three.

632
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,912
Mr. Clayton, I think we should
take a break for five minutes.

633
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,309
Tempers seem to be running a little high.

634
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,314
Come on, Linneman,
I was just starting to do good.

635
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,637
- Stack me a cooler.
- We'll be in the station in an hour.

636
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,870
The others are the losers.
You're still okay.

637
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,157
Fix me a deck. Threes and nines.
I'll cut it in on Clayton's deal.

638
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,673
What do you want Clayton to get?

639
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,639
Nothing. I want him out of there early.
I'll bust that bastard bookie in one play.

640
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,310
$400 to you, Mr. Jameson. You're even.

641
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,912
It just wasn't my night.

642
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,919
I need it.

643
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,116
- You know what time we get in?
- No, I don't.

644
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,914
Hey, where's your ante?

645
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,030
Every time I had anything,
he stayed in front of me.

646
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,628
$500.

647
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,672
Your five. $1,000.

648
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,199
I'll fold.

649
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,789
I'll play.

650
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,879
Cards?

651
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,348
Two.

652
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,796
Three.

653
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,475
$500.

654
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,992
Your $500 and $1,000.

655
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,998
Your $1,000. I'll raise you $2,000.

656
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,511
Your $2,000.

657
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,397
Mr. Clemens...

658
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,716
...give me $10,000 more.

659
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,354
I'll call.

660
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,032
Four nines.

661
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,390
Four jacks.

662
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,636
You owe me $15,000, pal.

663
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,072
Must've left my wallet in my room.

664
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,032
Don't hand me any of that crap!

665
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,156
When you come to a game,
you bring your money!

666
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,117
How do I know you won't take a powder?

667
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,919
I'll tell you what I'll do.

668
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,670
I'll send a boy to your room
in five minutes.

669
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,070
Better have the money or it'll be
all around Chicago that you welched.

670
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,196
You won't be able to get a game of jacks!

671
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,717
Cash me in for the rest of these bums.

672
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,836
You're on, kid.

673
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,036
But I tell you, it's a hard act to follow.

674
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,350
- How did it go?
- We got working money.

675
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,957
- He's steaming.
- Yeah.

676
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,393
Watch yourself.

677
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,550
Doyle, I know I gave him four threes!

678
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,197
He had to make a switch!
We can't let him get away with it.

679
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,477
What was I supposed to do?
Call him for cheating better than me?

680
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,752
Name's Kelly. Shaw sent me.

681
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,397
Your boss is quite a card player, Mr. Kelly.
How does he do it?

682
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,916
He cheats.

683
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,878
In that case, I'll keep my money,
and we'll have another game.

684
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,912
You don't have any to keep.

685
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,439
Here's your wallet.
He hired a dame to take it from you.

686
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,830
He's been planning
to beat your game for months.

687
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,878
He's been waiting for you to cheat him
so he could clip you.

688
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,833
Who do you think you're talking to?
Nobody sets me up!

689
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,434
Take him back to the baggage room!
Put one in his ear!

690
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,351
There were four witnesses at that table!

691
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,319
Then get that other son of a bitch
and dump them in the first tunnel.

692
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,436
We'll be in the station in a few minutes!

693
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,398
It ain't gonna look too good
killing a guy you owe money to.

694
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,109
There's better ways of taking him down.

695
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,595
What do you think Shaw would do to me
if he knew I was telling you this?

696
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,599
Okay.

697
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,079
Why the rat?

698
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,390
I want to take over his operation,
and I need you to help me break him.

699
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,117
- Where's my money?
- Shaw's got it.

700
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,476
How the hell could I ask him for it back?

701
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,598
We're pulling in.

702
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,513
I'm giving you a lift home.

703
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,678
- I was supposed to go with Shaw.
- Explain it to him somehow.

704
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,320
- But he's expecting me.
- I'm giving you a lift home.

705
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,036
You follow?

706
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,674
Yeah, sure. Sure thing.

707
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,675
- Why do you think you can beat him?
- I've been planning this for two years.

708
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,876
I know his organization
backwards and forwards.

709
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,428
I need somebody who's respectable
but not legit.

710
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,636
I'm a banker. That's legit in this state.

711
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,676
Just put down a bet for me
at Shaw's place.

712
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,116
I'll do the rest. I'll supply the money.
I'll supply the information.

713
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,597
What about the money
you come to collect?

714
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,353
I'll tell him you paid it.
I keep his books. He trusts me.

715
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,750
If you help me, I'll pay back the money
he stole out of my own pocket.

716
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,876
- It's worth that much to you?
- Yeah.

717
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,438
Oh, yeah. Maybe a couple of million.

718
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,076
Where do you come from, Kelly?

719
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,118
From the east side of New York.
A place called Five Points.

720
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,718
- But I got out of there.
- Out and up, huh?

721
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,472
I'll have to keep you away from this guy.
You're liable to get ideas.

722
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,232
I'll be at Klein's Drug Store...

723
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,756
...660 South Marshall at 1:30,
if you're interested.

724
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,192
If I'm not there by 1:45, I'm not coming.

725
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,437
Hey, Hooker, how did it go?

726
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,748
Jake.

727
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,839
- Everything go okay?
- Yeah, sure. Hell, easy.

728
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,791
- No sign of trouble?
- No.

729
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,110
- What about Lonnegan?
- I gave him the breakdown.

730
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,998
- And?
- He's good. He threatened to kill me.

731
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,398
If they don't do that,
you know you're not getting to them.

732
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,473
Hello, Doyle.

733
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,476
All right, Riley, what the hell happened?

734
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,309
We missed him.

735
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,756
Whoever he is, he made a fool out of you.

736
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,554
There was no way he could've known
we was in that room.

737
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,553
- Somebody must've wised him up.
- What does Cole say about that?

738
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,869
- I don't know. He took it hard.
- Get out of here, Riley.

739
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,632
Put Salino onto it.

740
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,395
Salino? Why waste our best people
on a small-time job?

741
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,075
This is a nickel-and-dime grifter
we're after.

742
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,151
- They'll get him.
- They had their chance.

743
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,073
All they did was shoot up a neighborhood,
wake up a few cops.

744
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,674
- But that was...
- I told you to put Salino onto it.

745
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,552
It may take a little more time,
but there won't be any holes.

746
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,756
Tell Cole I wanna see him
when he comes in.

747
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:53,032
He won't be coming in,
not to get bounced off a job, anyway.

748
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,429
This is Salino's job, Vince.

749
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,436
Cole wants to muscle in,
that's his business.

750
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,715
He's breaking the rules
and Salino won't like it.

751
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,358
Now, get me the books.

752
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:43,514
Those odds on the third race are wrong.

753
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,592
Just a minute. I'll get them.

754
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,918
Don't worry so much.
You're gonna be all right.

755
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,188
Just stay to the back the first time around.

756
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,235
Put a little of this on your nose.

757
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,389
Kelly?

758
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,919
You should always look to the back, kid.

759
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,389
I was afraid you wouldn't show.
We don't have much time.

760
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,674
Get on with it, then.

761
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,078
Sometime after 2:00...

762
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,829
...a guy's gonna call on that phone
and give you the name of a horse.

763
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,518
All you got to do
is take this $2,000 across the street...

764
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:06,156
...to Shaw's place, and bet it on that pony.
There's nothing to it.

765
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:10,194
Don't take too much time. We've only got
four minutes after you get the call.

766
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,511
You'll not break him with a $2,000 bet.

767
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,756
This is just a test.
The big one comes later.

768
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,671
Be careful with that. That's all I got.

769
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,275
You were gonna pay me back
out of your own pocket?

770
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:19,997
I am.

771
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,549
After the race.

772
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,792
I got to get back before Shaw misses me.
Good luck.

773
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,315
Yeah? Go ahead.

774
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,391
<i>The horse is Blue Note to win.</i>

775
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,914
<i>- Fourth race at Narragansett.
- Got it.</i>

776
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,110
Yeah?

777
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,829
<i>Blue Note to win in the fourth race
at Narragansett.</i>

778
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,709
<i>Turning for home,
it's Lady Scout by a length.</i>

779
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,314
<i>Speed Queen a half,
Lady Trust and Miss Petrina.</i>

780
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:37,154
<i>Into the stretch, it's Lady Scout ahead,
Speed Queen a half.</i>

781
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,512
<i>And at the wire,
it's Speed Queen the winner!</i>

782
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,909
<i>Lady Scout placed
and Miss Petrina showed.</i>

783
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,868
<i>Post numbers two, five and one.</i>

784
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,638
<i>Taking off at 23.</i>

785
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,991
Look at that.

786
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,839
He's got his apes with him.

787
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,037
We'll have to do something about that.

788
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,152
<i>Bubblesome is 10, Beefsteak, 7...</i>

789
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,471
<i>...Vote Boy, 6, Kerry Patch, 12.</i>

790
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,120
<i>Blue Note is 7-1.</i>

791
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,478
<i>This is your last call
for the third race at Lincoln Fields.</i>

792
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,399
<i>They're going to the post.</i>

793
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:16,552
<i>- You may still wager if you hurry.
- There he goes.</i>

794
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,635
<i>At Detroit, the winner,
Speed Queen, paid $7.20...</i>

795
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,638
<i>...$4.60 and $3.40.</i>

796
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,910
<i>Lady Scout, $7 and $4.20.</i>

797
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,350
<i>Miss Petrina paid $4.</i>

798
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:33,952
<i>Last flash at Narragansett.
Lady Higloss, 6-5.</i>

799
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,950
I'd think you'd get tired of losing, Harrigan.

800
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,919
Thank you, Mr. Williams.

801
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,788
Blue Note, $2,000 to win fourth race,
Narragansett.

802
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,951
Make sure you see the cash, Eddie.

803
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,749
He's got a name for betting money
he doesn't have.

804
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,989
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is Arnold Rowe,
your caller for the fourth race.</i>

805
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,834
<i>The mile and one-sixteenth handicap
at Narragansett Park, Rhode Island.</i>

806
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,117

<i>The flag is up, and they're off and running.</i>

808
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,312
<i>It's Bubblesome going to the front,

<i>...Vote Boy, Chancing,
Beefsteak, Kerry Patch...</i>

810
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,438
<i>...and Blue Note trails the field.</i>

811
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,988
<i>Around the clubhouse turn,

812
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,150
<i>...Chancing a half, Lady Higloss by one...</i>

813
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,198

814
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,555
<i>Into the second turn,
it's Chancing by a length.</i>

Come on, Chancing!

818
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,596
<i>Lady Higloss a half, Vote Boy by one.</i>

819
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,156
Lady Higloss is a hell of a finisher.
Chancing's gonna have to open up.

820
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,069
Know anything about a horse
named Blue Note?

821
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,710
He never done much. Probably in there
just to round out the field.

822
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,070
Chancing's where you
want to have your money.

823
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,190
- Great tip you handed me, kid.
- Just give him time.

824
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,235
<i>Chancing by one.</i>

825
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,311
<i>And here's Blue Note,
driving on the outside!</i>

826
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,675
<i>- Nice work, Erie. He loves you.
- He's third!</i>

827
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,714
<i>Chancing is shortening stride,
and now it's Lady Higloss and Blue Note.</i>

828
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:08,190
<i>They're head to head.
They're neck to neck.</i>

829
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,192
<i>It's Lady Higloss, Blue Note.
Lady Higloss, Blue Note.</i>

830
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,398
<i>And Blue Note wins it by a nose!</i>

831
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,717
<i>Lady Higloss is second by three,
and Chancing is third by one.</i>

832
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,914
Who in the blazes is Blue Note?

833
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,795
<i>The winner, Blue Note,
paid $16, $9.40 and $6.</i>

834
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:29,954
So you want to have your money
on Chancing?

835
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,276
<i>Chancing paid $3.80.</i>

836
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,958
<i>Time for the mile and one-sixteenth.</i>

837
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,350
<i>They're going to the gate at Belmont.</i>

838
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,118
<i>And here are the late odds.</i>

839
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,832
Those garbage men belong to you?

840
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,195
Get them out of here and don't
bring them back. This is a class joint.

841
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,833
Hey, you!

842
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:57,633
- Kelly!
- Yes, sir?

843
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,353
Run those bums out of here.

844
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:05,077
- Mr. Shaw, could I...
- Don't give me any of your lip, kid.

845
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,112
Now, run them out of here.

846
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,358
<i>Time for the three-quarter mile: 1:11.4.</i>

847
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:21,799
<i>The winner, Panic Relief,
paid $12.40, $8.20 and $5.</i>

848
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,351
<i>Barbara A, $6.20 and $4.</i>

849
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,114
<i>Wilder paid $4.</i>

850
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,360
<i>They're at the post at Belmont at 38.</i>

851
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,797
<i>We're waiting on one.
I'll call Belmont next.</i>

852
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,629
That's it, fellas!

853
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,954
- I want to repeat that...
- All right, J.J.

854
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,718
What do you say, pal?

855
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,719
Yeah?

856
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,110
He's on his way.

857
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,673
Hi, Mutt.

858
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,153
Say, Jeff.

859
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,558
- What'd I tell you?
- You got lucky once. That's not enough.

860
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,392
Lucky, hell. I can do it every time.

861
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:35,474
- Why don't you then?
- It's better to do it all at once.

862
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,749
We're gonna put down $400,000 next week.

863
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,831
At 5-1 odds, that's $2 million.

864
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,429
- Twenty percent is yours.
- Got a system, Kelly?

865
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,274
No. You can still lose with a system.

866
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,078
You're past-posting, aren't you?

867
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,559
Could be.

868
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,229
How?

869
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,148
You're gonna stay in?

870
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,833
Not until I get some answers.

871
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,676
I got a partner downtown.

872
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,390
He runs the central office
of the Western Union.

873
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,675
Race results from
all over the country come in...

874
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,830
...and go across his desk to the bookies.

875
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:19,198
All he does is hold them up until he can
call us to get a bet down on the winner.

876
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,271
Then he releases the results
to the bookies.

877
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,477
We clean up on a race
that's already been run. You can't miss.

878
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,790
Unless the Western Union dicks
get ahold of it.

879
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,632
You got the $400,000 yet?

880
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,877
No, not yet, but...

881
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:43,236
- There's only $1,000 here.
- Make another bet tomorrow.

882
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,635
Where's my money?

883
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,029
- I got $16,000 coming.
- You owe me $15,000 already.

884
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,157
If your setup's as good as you say,
there's plenty more to come.

885
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:53,789
- I decide when to place the bets!
- Not if you want me to keep making them.

886
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:56,792
I must talk to my partner.
We can't afford to expose too much.

887
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,393
- I'll talk to him myself.
- No!

888
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,916
You've been waiting a long time for this.
Don't ruin it for yourself.

889
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,436
I'll pick you up tomorrow at 3:00.
You follow?

890
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,435
I told him the tale, but he didn't go for it.

891
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,590
He wants to see my partner
tomorrow at 3:00.

892
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,079
<i>- 3:00?
- Yeah.</i>

893
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,277
We can't get a telegraph store set up.
Can we talk him out of it?

894
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:50,238
No. I would've stalled him,
but I didn't have any help.

895
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,472
We'll have to play him on the fly.
I'll put Eddie to work.

896
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,393
<i>- Let me know when you got something.
- Sure thing, tootsie.</i>

897
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,591
All right, Hooker!

898
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,997
Stop him!

899
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:20,198
Hooker! Hooker!

900
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,033
I'll get you, you rat!

901
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,070
Why didn't you tell me
about Snyder before?

902
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,355
- I thought I'd lost him.
- You found him again.

903
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,556
We'll have to do something about it.

904
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,598
- What else haven't you been telling me?
- Nothing. That's all.

905
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,079
Hold still.

906
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,591
Why did you move out of your room?

907
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,192
It was too noisy.

908
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,717
You can't play your friends like marks.

909
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,878
You know how easy it would be
for Lonnegan's guys to get you?

910
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,473
All we need is a couple of days...

911
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,875
...and we can nail the son of a bitch.

912
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,876
You just won't learn, will you?

913
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:03,270
I come in here, teach you stuff
that maybe five guys in the world know.

914
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,396
Stuff most grifters couldn't do.

915
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,790
- All you want to do is run down a bullet.
- I'm asking a couple of days.

916
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,711
I can stay clear that long!

917
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,918
Christ, they'll probably miss you
and hit me.

918
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,630
- Hey.
- Hi.

919
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,471
What will you have?

920
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:59,555
- Give me the blue plate special.
- One blue plate special.

921
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,277
- You're done?
- Yeah.

922
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,511
- Guess I should've had the meat loaf.
- It isn't any better.

923
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,430
- Hey, where's June?
- She quit.

924
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:44,309
I'm filling in for her a couple of days
until I can get a train out of here.

925
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:45,954
Yeah? Where are you going?

926
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:49,113
I don't know.
Depends on what train I get on.

927
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,753
- Keep it.
- Thanks.

928
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,392
Let's go.

929
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,753
Excuse me, ma'am,
but we're looking for Mr...

930
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,399
Mr. Harmont's office.

931
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,277
- Mr. Harmon?
- Yeah.

932
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,516
Got a work order for a painting job.

933
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,392
- For Mr. Harmon's office?
- That's right.

934
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,436
Well, hold on. Just a second.

935
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,708
- Where to?
- 110 South Wabash.

936
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,474
110 South Wabash. Get going.

937
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,832
What happened to your face?

938
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,309
Got into a fight with a raggle
down on 13th.

939
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,113
Cut me with her ring.

940
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,239
You ought to lay off the skirts.

941
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:26,310
You don't find any of my boys
messing around with that kind of trash.

942
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,316
Brigham signed it, all right.
I can't understand why he didn't tell me.

943
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,118
He's like all them supervisors.

944
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,270
They think they're too good
for regular people.

945
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,794
He says he was here
and the place was a mess.

946
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,916
We'll hurry so we don't keep you
out too long.

947
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,638
Why can't I work with you in here?

948
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,997
We got to cover the floor and the furniture,
so we don't spill.

949
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:55,478
If you want to sit in here with a tarp
over your head, go ahead.

950
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:56,955
How long will you be?

951
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,270
An hour or two at the most.
It's a small job.

952
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,198
We'll go in the side door here.

953
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,111
Hiya, Les.

954
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,633
Les, this is Doyle Lonnegan.

955
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,950
- Mr. Lonnegan, this is Les Harmon.
- How do you do?

956
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,397
What did you bring him here for?

957
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,391
I thought that he should see the operation.

958
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:10,438
I'm having the place painted.
We can't talk in here now.

959
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:14,639
We'll have to find someplace else.
Excuse me, Mr. Lonnegan.

960
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,272
<i>Miss Barnes, I'm going home a little early.</i>

961
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,955
<i>If there are any calls, tell them
they can reach me here tomorrow morning.</i>

962
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,796
Mr. Lonnegan?

963
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,238
I want to see it one more time.

964
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,993
I can't do it.
We got telegraph inspectors everywhere.

965
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,718
One more time won't make a difference.

966
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,234
We got $400,000
coming in from the coast next week.

967
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,595
You gonna risk that on a lousy 15 G's?

968
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,833
If it works again tomorrow,
I'll finance the whole thing.

969
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:18,677
$500,000. 60-40, we split.

970
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:21,911
We've already got a guy.
He's gonna give us half.

971
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,833
- What am I supposed to say to him?
- Say to him what you want.

972
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,591
Knowing your operation, if I were you...

973
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,796
...I'd be worried about making me happy.

974
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:32,519
Your guy says a week.
How do we know it won't be a month?

975
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:35,592
Lonnegan's a banker. He can get
the money without any questions.

976
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,513
We can't keep going into Shaw's
and cleaning up on long shots.

977
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,876
- He's bound to get wise.
- All right. We'll go for short odds.

978
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,398
You follow?

979
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,317
Are you Lt. William Snyder?

980
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,472
I don't know. What's up?

981
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,672
FBI.

982
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,755
Special Agent Polk would like
a few words with you.

983
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:16,239
You got a couple of minutes?

984
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,359
Yeah, sure.

985
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,876
No. It's got to be south of the river.

986
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:51,511
Probably this section in here.
31st, 39th, Morgan and Halsted.

987
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,353
Now, that's this section here.

988
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:58,596
Now, let's break it
into two sections along 35th.

989
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,035
What the hell is this? I got work to do.

990
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,796
Sit down and shut up, will you?

991
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,760
Try not to live up to all my expectations.

992
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,351
Take two men along. Work your way south
from 31st to 35th, Morgan and Halsted.

993
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,874
Go into every place
and let me know what you find.

994
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,872
We've been told, you know a hustle artist
named Johnny Hooker.

995
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,268
- Do you know him?
- Yeah, but I don't know where he is.

996
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:33,638
Well, we do. He's chumming around
with a big C named Henry Gondorff.

997
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:35,750
Ring any bells?

998
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,150
Every bunco man in the country
knows Gondorff.

999
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,517
Well, there's word he's gonna run a con
on the South Side here.

1000
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:45,157
We've got a Florida warrant on him,
but it's a thin beef.

1001
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:48,437
He can beat it in court
unless we catch him cold.

1002
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,315
All we want you to do
is pick up Hooker for us.

1003
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,311
Why don't you pick him up yourself?

1004
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:58,159
If word gets out the feds are in on it,
Gondorff will fold up the whole thing.

1005
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:59,873
Wouldn't that be too bad?

1006
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:03,272
Then you'd have to move out
of this nice office you've got here.

1007
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,915
Don't crack wise with me, flatfoot.

1008
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:11,592
I spent too much time in dumps like this
eating Gondorff's dust...

1009
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,752
...while you guys in the bunco squads
get rich tipping him off!

1010
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,030
That's not gonna happen this time.

1011
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,029
We're not gonna tell the police we're here.

1012
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:24,509
You keep your mouth shut and do a job,
there'll be reward bucks in it for you.

1013
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,794
And you better take it, 'cause
I can make you work for us without it.

1014
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,513
What the hell good is Hooker to you?

1015
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,555
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.

1016
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:38,148
- He'll never do it.
- I think he will.

1017
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,391
He's there. Let's get on it.

1018
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:05,917
What's the line on Exponent?

1019
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:08,679
5-1.

1020
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,592
- How's it going?
- Nothing yet.

1021
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,833
I had a good one on the lead
at Lincoln Fields, but he faded.

1022
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:19,550
Best we had the last hour was Love Potion
at Rockingham and she was 5-1.

1023
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,593
All the long shots coming in today.

1024
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,077
Take 4-1 if you have to.

1025
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,559
Okay.

1026
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:29,998
You can forget the boodle, Eddie.

1027
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,233
He could hit us for $15,000 at 4-1.
We can't handle that.

1028
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,551
- Give him the shutout.
- Okay.

1029
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,355
Okay, Billie, here we go.

1030
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:41,719
At the wire, it's Wrecking Crew,
the winner by five.

1031
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:45,156
Black Mischief, second. Whichaway, third.

1032
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:49,359
Wrecking Crew was 3-1. That's our boy.

1033
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,110
Henry?

1034
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,640
Here we go. We got a 3-1 at Belmont.
Wrecking Crew.

1035
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,958
<i>- Yeah?
- In the sixth race at Belmont.</i>

1036
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,679
<i>Wrecking Crew to win,
Black Mischief to place...</i>

1037
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,159
<i>...Whichaway to show.</i>

1038
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,233
Wait here.

1039
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,829
<i>The winner, Time to Go, paid $7...</i>

1040
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,355
<i>...$5.40 and $3.80.</i>

1041
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:56,552
<i>Joy Flag, $6 and $4.20.</i>

1042
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,275
<i>Readily paid $3.80 to show.</i>

1043
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:03,310
<i>The weather's threatening, but the track
is fast in Salem, New Hampshire.</i>

1044
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:09,072
<i>Here's a late jockey change
there in the fifth at Rockingham.</i>

1045
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,993
<i>R.C. Stark will ride Itsie-Bitsie.</i>

1046
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:17,634
$5,000 on Black Mischief, across the board.
The sixth at Belmont.

1047
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,068
Would you hurry up there, please?

1048
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:25,749
<i>Wrecking Crew is 3-1, Vale of Tears, 4...</i>

1049
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,959
<i>...Black Mischief, 5, Whichaway, 6...</i>

1050
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:32,829
<i>...Chief Yeoman, 12, Peerless Pal is 20...</i>

1051
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,594
<i>...and Mariato is 40.</i>

1052
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,636
<i>And here we go for the sixth at Belmont.</i>

1053
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:40,075
<i>It's five and a half furlongs.
They're at the post.</i>

1054
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:41,354
<i>- Now.
- The flag is up.</i>

1055
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,793
<i>- They're off!
- Belmont, $15,000.</i>

1056
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,997
Excuse me, sir. We can't take any bets
once the race is started.

1057
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:48,554
You can bet on another race if you care to.

1058
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,759
<i>Going into the backstretch,
it's Wrecking Crew by two.</i>

1059
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,788
<i>Whichaway a half, Black Mischief
and Vale of Tears riding on the outside.</i>

1060
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:58,110
- Nothing, thank you.
- What happened?

1061
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,311
I didn't get the bet down in time.

1062
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,713
Jesus!

1063
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:07,992
<i>Heading for home, it's Wrecking Crew
all alone by six lengths...</i>

1064
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,957
<i>...Whichaway a length, and Vale of Tears.</i>

1065
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:12,315
<i>It's Wrecking Crew,
Whichaway and Black Mischief.</i>

1066
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:15,949
<i>And at the wire,
Wrecking Crew wins it by six lengths.</i>

1067
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,837
<i>Black Mischief is second by a head...</i>

1068
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,753
<i>...Whichaway is third,
followed by Vale of Tears.</i>

1069
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,236
You should've had your money
on Wrecking Crew.

1070
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,993
<i>It's raining and the track is sloppy
at Riverside Park.</i>

1071
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:28,639
<i>There's a late scratch there.</i>

1072
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:31,996
<i>Transmutate is scratched
in the fifth at Riverside.</i>

1073
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,035
<i>At Belmont, the winner, Wrecking Crew...</i>

1074
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,475
<i>...paid $6, $4.20 and $2.80.</i>

1075
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:41,113
<i>Black Mischief, $4.60 and $3.20.</i>

1076
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:48,074
I'll have $500,000 here
by post time tomorrow.

1077
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,949
Lay it on a race
where the odds are 4-1 or better.

1078
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,554
- Make sure I get to the window.
- How am I gonna do that?

1079
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:56,029
I don't know.
Figure it out for yourself, Kelly.

1080
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,314
Finished?

1081
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:27,832
Yeah. Meat loaf, apple pie
and a cup of coffee.

1082
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,908
- Say, what time you get off work here?
- 2:00 a.m.

1083
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:41,398
- Yeah? Doing anything tonight?
- Yeah. Sleeping.

1084
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:43,388
Eighty-five.

1085
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:03,238
- Is there a back door?
- What's wrong with the front?

1086
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:06,437
There's a guy out there I don't need to see.
Don't look around.

1087
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,710
- What does he want?
- He'd like to kill me.

1088
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:13,395
Do me a favor. Go into the bathroom,
open the window and wait there.

1089
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,160
Do what I tell you,
and everything will be jake.

1090
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,355
Please.

1091
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,198
Thanks. Good night.

1092
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,078
It's taken.

1093
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:19,756
Thanks. See you.

1094
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,109
Shit.

1095
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,233
Salino. Hey, I wasn't...

1096
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:34,474
Hey! Got you, Hooker!

1097
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:38,318
- Hey there, Snyder. Long time no see.
- Get going!

1098
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:06,789
Chuck...

1099
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,709
...get this to the Department right away.
- Yes, sir.

1100
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:30,117
Hello, Hooker. Take them off.

1101
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,032
Special Agent Polk, FBI.

1102
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,555
Have a chair.

1103
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,831
- You want a drink or something?
- No.

1104
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:43,995
We want to talk to you
about Henry Gondorff.

1105
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:46,679
Yeah? I don't think I know him.

1106
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:50,676
Give yourself a couple of seconds.
You wouldn't want to lie to me.

1107
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,998
Lt. Snyder says you've done
lots of confidence work in his town.

1108
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,150
Oh, yeah? Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.

1109
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:00,359
- You ain't got nothing on me.
- Yeah?

1110
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:02,993
How about counterfeiting?

1111
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:09,829
We've got a tip that Gondorff
is gonna run a con on the South Side here.

1112
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:13,797
All you've got to do is tell us
when he's gonna play his chump.

1113
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:16,229
We come in at the sting,
make the pinch, and...

1114
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,631
...you walk out free as a bird.

1115
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,113
No.

1116
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:26,388
You want to spend the next 20 years
in a federal penitentiary, starting tonight?

1117
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:28,675
I'll make parole.

1118
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:32,239
Like hell. You won't even get a review.

1119
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,799
I'll chance it.

1120
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:40,157
Okay. If that's the way you want it.

1121
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:43,991
We might provide you with
a little company on your way up the river.

1122
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,469
That wife of Luther Coleman's.
What was her name?

1123
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,998
- Alva.
- Alva.

1124
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:50,991
That's it. Alva Coleman.

1125
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:53,950
Pretty fair grifter in her time.

1126
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,596
Snyder's given us quite a folder on her.

1127
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:00,234
Nothing major by itself, but...

1128
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:03,517
...put them all together,
it could add up to a lot of years.

1129
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,635
- You stink, mister.
- Don't be a sap.

1130
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,673
It's not her I want.

1131
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:16,353
If you're too dumb to save yourself, there's
no sense dragging her down with you.

1132
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,158
It's over, Hooker.

1133
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:43,235
You can save me a lot of trouble.

1134
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:47,395
But I'm gonna get Henry Gondorff
whether you help me out or not.

1135
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:05,033
- You'll wait till the chump is played?
- Hell, yes.

1136
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,396
We don't care about the mark.
He deserves it.

1137
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:11,268
I mean completely played. You come in
before we beat him, and I'll kill him.

1138
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,519
All right, Hooker.

1139
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:17,755
But you try to take it on the lam,
and we'll shoot you down on sight.

1140
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,989
As long as I get to finish the play.

1141
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:40,075
What is it, kid? You're not saying much.

1142
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:42,879
- Just got the jumps.
- Come in.

1143
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:46,557
Things are a little slow.
I want to open the round for the girls.

1144
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:47,834
Sure.

1145
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,717
Take it easy.
We're not gonna lose him now.

1146
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,394
We had him ten years ago
when he decided to be somebody.

1147
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:00,713
Believe me,
I've seen enough to know. Ten.

1148
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,713
- Twenty.
- Thirty.

1149
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:05,149
- Go.
- Thirty-one.

1150
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,994
How many guys you conned
in your life, Henry?

1151
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:17,113
I don't know, 200, 300.

1152
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:21,115
Sometimes we played two a day
when I was with O'Shea's mob.

1153
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,036
Of course, Chicago was a rigged town.

1154
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:27,749
The fix was in.
The dicks took their end without a beef.

1155
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:31,115
We had it down to a business.

1156
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:34,039
And it really stunk, kid.

1157
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:37,950
No sense in being a grifter
if it's the same thing as being a citizen.

1158
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:43,154
I got packing to do. I'm gonna be
a hot number again after tomorrow.

1159
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:56,877
I wouldn't ask you to do this
if it weren't for Luther.

1160
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:01,479
Nothin's gonna make up for Luther.
Revenge is for suckers.

1161
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:04,189
I've been grifting 30 years. I never got any.

1162
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:09,038
Then why're you doing it?

1163
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,355
It seems worthwhile, doesn't it?

1164
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:20,673
See you.

1165
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:36,793
Looks like he missed you.

1166
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,430
Yeah. This time, anyway.

1167
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:42,351
Good night, Mrs. Hillard.

1168
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:52,509
I was wondering if you might want
to come out for a while...

1169
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,318
...maybe have a drink or something.

1170
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,916
You move right along, don't you?

1171
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:59,631
Hey, I don't mean nothing by it.

1172
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,629
I just don't know many regular girls, is all.

1173
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,475
And you expect me
to come out just like that?

1174
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:09,030
If I expected something,
I wouldn't still be standing here in the hall.

1175
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:10,872
I don't even know you.

1176
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,230
You know me. I'm just like you.

1177
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:18,674
It's 2:00 a.m., and I don't know nobody.

1178
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,630
Come on, Henry. Knock off.

1179
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,271
You've done everything you can.

1180
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:12,433
<i>- Yeah? Polk.
- Polk, this is Hooker.</i>

1181
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:14,796
<i>- Ready?
- Yeah, go ahead.</i>

1182
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:17,470
Everything's set.
There'll be a guy at the door.

1183
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:19,676
Nobody's got heaters.
You won't have any trouble.

1184
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:21,591
Okay. See you there.

1185
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,549
She was gonna kill you, kid.
Her name's Loretta Salino.

1186
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,833
Lonnegan's people set her up in the diner.
Come on.

1187
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:31,031
Let's get out of here.

1188
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:33,478
Come on!

1189
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:39,518
Come on!

1190
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:46,911
She could have killed me last night.

1191
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:49,630
Too many people could have seen you.

1192
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:52,996
She was a real professional.
Used to work in the Dutch Schultz mob.

1193
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:56,672
Who are you?

1194
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:59,236
Gondorff asked me to look after you.

1195
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:13,916
We just got a tip that Gondorff's mark
is some big New York wheel.

1196
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:17,119
As soon as we're inside,
you get him out of there fast...

1197
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:18,519
...before the reporters show up.

1198
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:21,478
I don't want any big shots around
to mess this up for me.

1199
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:23,352
All right, let's go!

1200
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:23,758
Let's go, guys!

1201
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:26,518
The flag is up, kid.

1202
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,230
- Anytime, J.J.
- I'm working on it.

1203
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,231
We got one, Billie. Here we go.

1204
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:04,509
<i>- Yeah?
- Place it on Lucky Dan...</i>

1205
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:06,909
<i>...third race at Riverside Park.</i>

1206
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:28,035
<i>...One minute 11 and three-fifths seconds.</i>

1207
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:30,629
<i>They were off at 21.</i>

1208
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:34,758
<i>Last call on the third at Riverside Park.</i>

1209
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:36,512
<i>They're at the post.</i>

1210
01:55:37,120 --> 01:55:39,714
<i>At Havre De Grace,
the winner, Light Chatter...</i>

1211
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:43,197
<i>...paid $5.40, $3.80...</i>

1212
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:45,994
<i>...and $2.40. Blacksod...</i>

1213
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:48,830
$500,000 to win.

1214
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:52,354
Lucky Dan, third race at Riverside.

1215
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:56,509
You heard me.

1216
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:01,353
Hold on, sir. I'll get the manager.

1217
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:03,198
<i>...in the fourth at Belmont.</i>

1218
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:05,840
<i>Jay Stout will ride Flying Cross.</i>

1219
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:11,473
See that guy over there?
He just bet $500,000 on Lucky Dan.

1220
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:14,395
<i>The winner at Rockingham Park...</i>

1221
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:17,473
<i>...Enfin, paid $6. 10...</i>

1222
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:20,439
<i>...$4.30 and $2.50.</i>

1223
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:26,355
What's your problem?

1224
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:30,389
I'm putting $500,000 on Lucky Dan
to win the third race at Riverside.

1225
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:34,309
Can't lay that off in time.
A bet like that could break us.

1226
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,870
Not only are you a cheat...

1227
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:41,191
...you're a gutless cheat as well.

1228
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:48,674
- What are the odds?
- 4-1.

1229
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:53,153
Take all of it.

1230
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,558
This is Arnold Rowe...

1231
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:07,915
<i>...calling the third race at Riverside.</i>

1232
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:11,238
<i>This is a claiming race for $1,500
for 3-year-olds and up.</i>

1233
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:13,437
<i>It's been raining, and the track is muddy.</i>

1234
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:17,308
<i>The flag is up and they're off and running.</i>

1235
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:19,557
<i>Dr. Twink is going to the front...</i>

1236
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:22,473
<i>...followed by Lucky Dan,
Ima Dreamer, Orkin...</i>

1237
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:25,593
<i>...Josie G., Chi Chi and Little Star.</i>

1238
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:28,353
Around the clubhouse turn,
it's Lucky Dan ahead...

1239
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:30,670
<i>...Dr. Twink a length, Orkin a half...</i>

1240
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:34,918
<i>...followed by Ima Dreamer,
Josie G., Chi Chi and Little Star.</i>

1241
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:36,997
<i>Into the backstretch...</i>

1242
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:39,554
<i>...it's Lucky Dan a length, Dr. Twink a half...</i>

1243
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:42,074
<i>...Orkin a head, Ima Dreamer by one.</i>

1244
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:44,954
Sorry, I couldn't wait.
Everything going all right?

1245
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:47,711
You got nothing to worry about.

1246
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:51,076
I put it all on Lucky Dan.

1247
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:53,630
$500,000 to win.

1248
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:55,750
To win?

1249
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:00,919
I said place! Place it on Lucky...

1250
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,991
That horse is gonna run second!

1251
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:07,039
<i>Ima Dreamer a half, Dr. Twink a half
and Orkin by two, followed by Little Star.</i>

1252
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:09,878
<i>It's a driving finish!</i>

1253
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:12,428
There's been a mistake.
Give me my money back!

1254
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:15,557
I tell you there's been a mistake!
Give me my goddamn money back!

1255
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:18,548
All right, FBI! Don't anybody try to leave.

1256
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:22,030
Stand on your feet, put your hands
over your head and move nice and slow.

1257
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:23,589
Snyder!

1258
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:28,709
Get them up against the wall.
Make sure they're not carrying anything.

1259
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:34,959
Hello, Henry. It's been a long time.

1260
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,399
But it's over.

1261
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:39,912
Okay, kid, you can go.

1262
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:44,394
All right, I said hands up. Keep them up!

1263
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:47,917
Come on. Move them back! Put them up!

1264
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:09,359
Get him out. Get him out!

1265
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:12,829
Come on! Got to get you out of here!

1266
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:25,030
- Come on!
- But my money's in there!

1267
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:27,709
There's some dead guys too.
You can't get mixed up.

1268
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:30,519
You don't understand.
There's $500,000 in there!

1269
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:42,468
He's gone.

1270
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:50,551
Okay, Henry, all clear.

1271
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,230
Can you believe it? We pulled it off.

1272
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:15,194
It's a nice con, Hickey. I thought you were
the feds myself when you came in.

1273
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:18,273
No trouble, Henry.
Snyder went for it all the way.

1274
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:21,557
You should've seen the rag
he lit under Lonnegan!

1275
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:28,671
Well, kid, you beat him.

1276
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:32,595
You're right, Henry. It's not enough.

1277
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:37,558
But it's close.

1278
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:43,592
Okay, guys, let's take this place apart fast.

1279
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:46,712
You can pick up your splits from Eddie
at Boudreau's tonight.

1280
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:53,318
Nice going, J.J.

1281
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,274
Oh, Henry!

1282
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:15,989
You're not gonna stick around
for your share?

1283
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:18,997
Nah. I'd only blow it.
