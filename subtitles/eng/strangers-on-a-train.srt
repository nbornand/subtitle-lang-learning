00:02:24,132 --> 00:02:25,300
Excuse me.

3
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:34,266
I beg your pardon.
Aren't you Guy Haines?

4
00:02:34,892 --> 00:02:39,563
I saw you bIast Faraday right off
the court in South Orange Iast season.

5
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,566
-Made the semifinaIs, didn't you?
-Yeah.

6
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:46,152
Oh, I certainIy admire peopIe
who do things.

7
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:50,531
By the way, my name is Bruno.
Bruno Antony.

8
00:02:51,032 --> 00:02:52,033
See?

9
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:55,661
It's corny,
but my mother gave it to me...

10
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:58,414
-...so I wear it to pIease her.
-How do you do?

11
00:02:58,622 --> 00:03:00,832
I don't taIk much.
You go ahead and read.

12
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,417
Thanks.

13
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:09,383
You know, it must be pretty exciting
to be so important.

14
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:13,304
-Tennis pIayer isn't so important.
-But peopIe who do things are.

15
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:18,683
I never do anything. I suppose you're
going to Southampton for the doubIes.

16
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:20,644
You are a tennis fan.

17
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:24,814
I wish I couId go watch you,
but I've gotta get back to Washington.

18
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:27,024
I'm from ArIington, you know.

19
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,197
-Cigarette?
-No, thanks. I don't smoke much.

20
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:35,824
Me, I smoke too much.

21
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:38,285
Oh, here.

22
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:39,995
Oh, thanks.

23
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:42,455
EIegant.

24
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:48,920
"From A to G."
I'II bet I can guess who "A" is.

25
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,755
-Yeah?
-Anne Morton.

26
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,843
Sometimes I turn the sports page
and I see the society section.

27
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:58,762
And the pictures.
She's very beautifuI.

28
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:01,056
Senator Morton's daughter, huh?

29
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:03,600
You're quite a reader, Mr. Antony.

30
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,769
Yes, I am. Ask me anything. I got the answer

31
00:04:06,148 --> 00:04:08,158
Even about peopIe I don't know.

32
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:11,778
Like who wouId Iike to marry whom...

33
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:17,659
-...when his wife gets her divorce.
-Perhaps you read too much.

34
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:22,246
Oh, there I go again. Too friendIy.
It aIways happens.

35
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:26,500
I meet somebody who I Iike and admire,
and I open my mouth too much.

36
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:27,510
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:31,097
That's aII right, forget it.
I guess I'm a IittIe jittery.

38
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:33,391
Oh, there's a new cure for that.

39
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:35,517
-Waiter.
-Yes, sir.

40
00:04:35,768 --> 00:04:39,938
Scotch and pIain water, pIease.
A pair. DoubIes.

41
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,692
-The onIy kind of doubIes I pIay.
-You'II have to drink both of them.

42
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,402
And I can do it.

43
00:04:47,237 --> 00:04:48,696
When's the wedding?

44
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,574
-What?
-The wedding. You and Anne Morton.

45
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:52,908
It was in the papers.

46
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:56,537
It shouIdn't have been. Unless they
IegaIized bigamy overnight.

47
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:00,457
Oh, I've got a wonderfuI theory
about that.

48
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:02,751
Someday I'II teII you about it.

49
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:07,380
But right now, I suppose divorce is,
weII, the simpIest operation.

50
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:12,760
It's wonderfuI having you
as company aII the way to New York.

51
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,430
As a matter of fact, I'm not going direct.
I'm stopping off in MetcaIf.

52
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,850
MetcaIf? Who wouId want
to stop off at MetcaIf?

53
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,643
WeII, it's my hometown.

54
00:05:21,893 --> 00:05:26,481
Oh, I get it. A IittIe chat
with your wife about the divorce.

55
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:28,358
CIose enough.

56
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,067
Thanks. I think I wiII.

57
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:32,737
WeII, here's Iuck.

58
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:36,699
Drink up and we'II have Iunch sent
to my compartment.

59
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:41,620
Thanks very much, but I'II go to the dining car.
Oh, waiter.

60
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:46,833
-Are there any seats in the diner?
-Not for about 20 minutes I am afraid sir, sir.

61
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,835
You'II have to Iunch with me.

62
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:51,641
WeII...

63
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:54,435
...here's to the next Mrs. Haines.

64
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:04,194
Sure, I went to coIIege.
Got kicked out of three of them.

65
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:06,488
Drinking and gambIing.

66
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:07,905
Not Iike you, huh?

67
00:06:08,197 --> 00:06:09,991
AII right, so I'm a bum.

68
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:11,117
Who said you were?

69
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:13,536
My father.

70
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:16,455
He hates me.

71
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:21,251
With aII the money he has got, he thinks I ought
to catch the 8:05 bus every morning...

72
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:25,213
...punch a time cIock and work my way
up seIIing paint or something.

73
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:27,548
What do you think of a man Iike that?

74
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:32,470
-WeII, I think possibIy--
-Yes, I hate him too.

75
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:36,932
I teII you, I get so sore
at him sometimes...

76
00:06:37,182 --> 00:06:38,767
...I want to kiII him.

77
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:43,563
-I don't think you know what you want.
-WeII, I want to do something.

78
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:45,440
Everything.

79
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:50,820
You know, I've got a theory that you
shouId do everything before you die.

80
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:56,700
Have you ever driven a car
bIindfoIded at 150 miIes an hour?

81
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:58,660
Not IateIy.

82
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:00,579
I did.

83
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:03,164
I fIew in a jet pIane too.

84
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,752
Man, that's a thriII. AImost bIew
the sawdust out of my head.

85
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:13,466
And I'm going to make a reservation
on the first rocket to the moon.

86
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:17,594
-What are you trying to prove?
-WeII, I'm not Iike you.

87
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:19,888
You're Iucky. You're smart.

88
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:25,435
Marrying the boss's daughter makes a
nice shortcut to a career, doesn't it?

89
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:29,105
Marrying the senator's daughter has
nothing to do with it.

90
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:32,608
Can't I Iook beyond a tennis net
without being out for something?

91
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:36,779
Take it easy. I'm your friend,
remember? I Iike you.

92
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:38,697
I'd do anything for you.

93
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:40,365
Sure, Bruno.

94
00:07:40,574 --> 00:07:43,451
We'II be puIIing in soon.
I've got to change trains.

95
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:46,579
What did you say her name was?
Your wife's?

96
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:48,790
-Miriam.
-Miriam, that's it.

97
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,125
Miriam Joyce Haines.

98
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,753
I suppose she pIayed around a Iot.

99
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,383
Skip it, Bruno.

100
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:58,719
It's painfuI for a man
to discover he's been a chump.

101
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:00,971
Okay.

102
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:08,144
Want to hear one of my ideas
for a perfect murder?

103
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:10,730
The "Iight socket in the bathroom"...

104
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:13,649
...or the "carbon monoxide
in the garage"?

105
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:18,070
Neither one. I may be oId-fashioned,
but murder is against the Iaw.

106
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:22,754
What is a Iife or two, Guy?
Some peopIe are better off dead.

107
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:26,007
WeII, Iike your wife and my father,
for instance.

108
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:31,011
Oh, that reminds me
of a wonderfuI idea I had once.

109
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:35,766
I used to put myseIf to sIeep
at night, figuring it out.

110
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,854
Now, Iet's say that you'd Iike
to get rid of your wife.

111
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,732
-That's a morbid thought.
-No, no, no. Just suppose.

112
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,651
Let's say you had a good reason.

113
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,154
-No, Iet's not--
-No, no. Let's say.

114
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:54,116
You'd be afraid to kiII her.
You know why. You'd get caught.

115
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,826
And what wouId trip you up?

116
00:08:56,076 --> 00:08:57,869
The motive.

117
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:00,747
Now, here's my idea.

118
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:02,582
I haven't got time to Iisten.

119
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,418
Listen. It's so simpIe too.

120
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:08,963
Two feIIows meet accidentaIIy,
Iike you and me.

121
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:12,091
No connection.
Never saw each other before.

122
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:16,220
Each one has somebody that he'd Iike
to get rid of.

123
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:17,888
So...

124
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:19,556
...they swap murders.

125
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:21,808
Swap murders?

126
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:23,768
Each does the other's murder.

127
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:27,980
Then there's nothing to connect them.
Each one has murdered a stranger.

128
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:31,442
Like you do my murder, I do yours.

129
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:33,694
We're coming into my station.

130
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:38,657
For exampIe: your wife, my father.
Crisscross.

131
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:42,243
-What?
-We taIk the same Ianguage, don't we?

132
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:45,413
Sure, we taIk the same Ianguage.
Thanks for Iunch.

133
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:49,500
I'm gIad you enjoyed it.
The Iamb chops were a IittIe overdone.

134
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,751
Nice meeting you.

135
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:54,421
Now, you think my theory's okay, Guy?
I mean, you Iike it?

136
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:56,882
Sure, Bruno, sure.

137
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,508
They're aII okay.

138
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:20,445
Crisscross.

139
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,430
-Hiya, BiII.
-Guy Haines! Good to see you, boy.

140
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:49,641
You'd better win at Southampton.
I got two bucks on you.

141
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,977
-Park these in a Iucky spot for two hours, wiII you?
-Sure thing.

142
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:18,834
One-fifty, two, three, four, five.
There you are.

143
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:21,170
-Thank you very much.
-You're weIcome.

144
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:26,216
-HeIIo, Guy.
-You're Iooking weII, Miriam.

145
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:27,551
So are you.

146
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:31,638
Got a nice tan pIaying tennis
with aII your rich friends.

147
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:35,349
What what time do we meet your Iawyer?

148
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,602
What's your hurry?

149
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:41,855
My hurry?
That's funny, coming from you.

150
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:44,316
You're the one in a hurry, aren't you?

151
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:47,194
When you wouIdn't give
me the divorce...

152
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:50,196
...I sort of hoped it was
because you were jeaIous.

153
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:54,951
I got over being jeaIous
a Iong time ago, Miriam.

154
00:11:58,037 --> 00:11:59,538
Let's taIk in here.

155
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:13,718
WeII, this is cozier. Sort of Iike
oId times, isn't it?

156
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:15,595
Oh, skip it, Miriam.

157
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:19,056
It's pretty Iate to start fIirting
with a discarded husband.

158
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:22,476
EspeciaIIy when you're going
to have another man's baby.

159
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:25,520
You know, I think you're
handsomer than ever.

160
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:27,689
Let's get this over with.

161
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:30,275
You bring the money?
Lawyers are expensive.

162
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,818
Yes.

163
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:38,115
Here it is.

164
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,787
If I'd known what aII that tennis
nonsense of yours wouId Iead to...

165
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,039
...I wouIdn't have run out on you.

166
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,333
What are you trying to say, Miriam?

167
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:51,461
I'm not getting a divorce.

168
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:55,631
You IittIe doubIe-crosser!
I didn't want this divorce, you did.

169
00:12:55,882 --> 00:12:57,967
You've been harping
about it aII year!

170
00:12:58,217 --> 00:13:00,636
It's a woman's priviIege
to change her mind.

171
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:03,555
Now I can buy me
some pretty new cIothes.

172
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:07,767
I wouIdn't want you to be ashamed
of me in Washington...

173
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:10,437
...when we go to aII
those swanky parties.

174
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:13,773
-What do you mean by that?
-Don't Iook so mad.

175
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:16,901
You smiIe when your picture's
taken for the newspaper.

176
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:19,236
EspeciaIIy with Anne Morton
on your arm.

177
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,322
Let's not taIk about her.

178
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:24,116
It's serious between you two, huh?

179
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:27,702
You can throw aII your dreams
about her into the ashcan.

180
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:30,580
-I'm coming to Washington.
-What for?

181
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,667
-To have my baby and be with you.
-Why me? It's not my baby.

182
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:38,421
Yes, but peopIe don't know that.
Do they?

183
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:43,175
Make a pretty story: "The Senator's
Daughter InvoIved With A Married Man."

184
00:13:43,425 --> 00:13:46,720
-EspeciaIIy when he's to be a father.
-You conniving Iiar!

185
00:13:46,928 --> 00:13:48,597
Keep your voice down.

186
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:55,144
-What happened? He run out on you?
-No man runs out on me. Not even you.

187
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:58,189
You've been trying to get rid
of me Iong enough.

188
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:01,525
I don't want to see or hear you again.

189
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:06,863
I couId be pathetic as the deserted
mother in court. Think it over.

190
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:10,116
-Who wouId beIieve you?
-I'm warning you.

191
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:21,001
That's what shouId happen to peopIe
Iike you. I'd Iike to find--

192
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,756
Break it up, foIks. This isn't
the pIace for a famiIy quarreI.

193
00:14:26,006 --> 00:14:27,591
I'm sorry.

194
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,093
I'm Ieaving.

195
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:32,595
You heard what I said, Guy Haines.

196
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:36,557
You can't throw me away! I'm coming
to Washington to have my baby!

197
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:38,726
-TeII that to the Senate!
-PIease.

198
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:41,979
Anne?

199
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:44,481
Anne, darIing, I--

200
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:47,818
Yes, I'm in MetcaIf.

201
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:51,613
No, everything didn't go smoothIy.

202
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:54,782
She doesn't want the divorce.
Not now.

203
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:58,869
It's unbeIievabIe.

204
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:04,291
Yes, I know how you must feeI.

205
00:15:06,376 --> 00:15:08,336
But you sound so savage, Guy.

206
00:15:08,545 --> 00:15:13,132
Sure, I sound savage. I feeI savage.
I'd Iike to break her neck.

207
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:17,219
I said I'd Iike to break her fouI,
useIess IittIe neck.

208
00:15:22,683 --> 00:15:23,851
What's that?

209
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:27,104
I said I couId strangIe her!

210
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:32,442
I do wish you'd keep your hands quiet.

211
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:34,777
You're so restIess IateIy.

212
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:36,988
I Iike them to Iook just right.

213
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:39,448
Did I fiIe them too short?

214
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,243
Oh, no, Ma.
They're just fine. Thanks.

215
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:49,124
-What's the matter?
-I'm aII right. Don't worry about me.

216
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,043
But you Iook so paIe, dear.

217
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:53,753
Are you out of vitamins?

218
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:57,673
I took a bottIe yesterday, Ma.

219
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,384
A whoIe fifth.

220
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:04,805
Oh, but you have that Iook, dear.
I aIways can teII.

221
00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:07,891
Now, you haven't been doing
anything fooIish?

222
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:14,480
I do hope you've forgotten aII
about that siIIy IittIe pIan of yours.

223
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:18,150
-Which one?
-About bIowing up the White House.

224
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:21,737
Oh, Ma, I was onIy fooIing.

225
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:24,323
Besides, what wouId the president say?

226
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:29,160
You're a naughty boy, Bruno.

227
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:32,789
You couId aIways make me Iaugh.

228
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:40,796
Get shaved before
your father gets home.

229
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:47,469
I'm sick and tired of bowing
and scraping to the king.

230
00:16:48,136 --> 00:16:51,014
Now, now.
Now, Iet's not Iose controI.

231
00:16:51,347 --> 00:16:52,932
Come see my painting.

232
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,562
Bruno, I do wish
you'd take up painting.

233
00:16:58,854 --> 00:17:01,273
Such a soothing pastime.

234
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:22,167
Oh, Mother, you're wonderfuI!

235
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:25,712
That's the oId boy, aII right.
That's Father!

236
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,718
Is it?

237
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,807
I was trying to paint Saint Francis.

238
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,186
Excuse me, sir. They're ready
with your caII to Southampton.

239
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:55,448
-I want to taIk to you and your mother.
-Sorry, Father. Long distance.

240
00:17:57,283 --> 00:18:00,286
-Must you take that tone with him?
-HeIIo.

241
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:05,499
Guy.

242
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:06,708
Bruno.

243
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:09,836
What? Now, who did you say this is?

244
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:14,841
Bruno, Guy. Bruno Antony.
Don't you remember? On the train.

245
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:18,928
Are you getting your divorce?

246
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,265
He needs to go somepIace for
treatment before it's too Iate!

247
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:25,684
Oh, so she doubIe-crossed you.

248
00:18:25,892 --> 00:18:27,602
Are you going to see her again?

249
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:32,398
Now, just Iet's have Iunch first--

250
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:37,737
I'm going to have that boy taken care
of. If necessary, under restraint!

251
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:42,755
-Good night, Mom.
-Now, don't stay out Iate.

252
00:19:43,338 --> 00:19:45,382
-There's the bus!
-HoId on, driver!

253
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:47,676
-Hey!
-Hey, driver!

254
00:19:47,926 --> 00:19:49,552
-Hurry!
-Hey, wait a minute!

255
00:19:49,803 --> 00:19:51,012
Driver.

256
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:56,017
I'II get it, Tom.

257
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:57,351
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

258
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:16,827
Watch your step.

259
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:18,329
Easy does it, Tommy.

260
00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:21,665
-Hey, I'm hungry.
-Oh, hungry aIready!

261
00:20:28,004 --> 00:20:32,675
Hot dogs! Get them whiIe they're hot!
Red-hot! Right over here!

262
00:20:32,884 --> 00:20:37,638
Yes, sir, get your popcorn here.
Fresh popcorn! OnIy five cents a bag!

263
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,140
Come and get it!

264
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:45,228
Here you are!

265
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:48,398
Three cones, Arthur.
What fIavors you got?

266
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,525
-VaniIIa.
-VaniIIa? SweII.

267
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,113
-I shouId've had a hot dog before this.
-A hot dog?

268
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,199
Satisfy my craving a IittIe better.

269
00:20:58,407 --> 00:20:59,450
Craving for what?

270
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,368
I never saw a girI eat so much.

271
00:21:03,954 --> 00:21:06,289
-Where do you put it aII?
-This is good.

272
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:07,457
Want some money?

273
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:15,548
Are we going to the TunneI of Love?

274
00:21:15,756 --> 00:21:17,591
-Come on!
-Great. Come on.

275
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:24,014
-What do you caII that thing?
-I don't know.

276
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:29,894
Stick them up.

277
00:21:35,024 --> 00:21:38,569
Come cIoser, come cIoser!
Step right up and win a baby doII.

278
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:41,196
Let's go see who's the stronger.

279
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,535
1600.

280
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:50,288
Who eIse wants to take a chance
to win a Kewpie doII?

281
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:53,458
Here we go. Watch it.

282
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,834
Come on.

283
00:21:56,794 --> 00:21:59,505
-1600.
-How about you, sir?

284
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:00,965
Thank you.

285
00:22:01,215 --> 00:22:02,800
Here we go!

286
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:07,804
1700. You did not win
the Kewpie doII that time.

287
00:22:08,054 --> 00:22:10,056
WiII you try it again, sir?

288
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:13,851
Here we go. Watch it now.

289
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:19,398
1600. WiII you try it again and win
a nice Kewpie doII for the Iady?

290
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,150
Try your Iuck, mister?

291
00:22:23,026 --> 00:22:26,988
Come cIoser, come cIoser!
Step right up and win a baby doII!

292
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:29,407
Hot dogs! Here you are, foIks!

293
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:32,202
Red-hots! Right over here!

294
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:34,078
Here we go.

295
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,879
You just won a Kewpie doII.

296
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:46,381
Why, he's broken the thing.

297
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:49,092
Come on, Miriam.

298
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,595
Step right up
and get your ticket cashed!

299
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,889
Let's go on the merry-go-round!

300
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,381
Let's sing. Come on.

301
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:34,342
Casey would waltz
With the strawberry blond

302
00:23:34,592 --> 00:23:38,054
And the band played on

303
00:23:38,262 --> 00:23:41,432
He'd glide cross the floor
With the girl he adored

304
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,227
And the band played on

305
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:48,355
His brain was so loaded
It nearly exploded

306
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:52,233
The poor girl would shake with alarm

307
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:55,444
He'd marry the girl
With the strawberry curl

308
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:58,656
And the band played on

309
00:23:58,906 --> 00:24:00,824
Let's go for a boat ride.

310
00:24:07,372 --> 00:24:10,083
How about some popcorn?
I couId go for some.

311
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,126
Not now!

312
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:13,586
No fun necking
with a mouthfuI of popcorn.

313
00:24:13,836 --> 00:24:16,672
-Come on.
-Okay.

314
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,845
Take a ride. Take a sIide.

315
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:28,225
Take a trip with Iots of zip.
This way, Iadies and gentIemen.

316
00:24:32,478 --> 00:24:34,939
-How about this one?
-I'm gonna drive.

317
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:36,107
You're gonna drive?

318
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:40,361
Don't rock the boat!

319
00:24:41,987 --> 00:24:44,323
-Here we go.
-Anchors aweigh.

320
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:46,700
You sure you know how
to steer this tub?

321
00:25:22,107 --> 00:25:26,111
-Make him stop! Make him stop!
-I'm trying to steer the boat.

322
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:29,864
Hey, what's that? What are you doing?

323
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:32,992
Come on, come on, Miriam.

324
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,167
-Come on.
-Stop it!

325
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:56,931
Hang on.

326
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,061
Oh, wait a minute.

327
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,023
Easy does it, now.
Let's not break a Ieg.

328
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,191
We got use for you Iater.

329
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:27,834
Hey, Miriam!

330
00:26:34,715 --> 00:26:36,092
Is your name Miriam?

331
00:26:36,342 --> 00:26:38,844
Why, yes. How did you--?

332
00:27:01,407 --> 00:27:03,075
Hey, Miriam!

333
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:06,203
Miriam, where are you?

334
00:27:06,411 --> 00:27:07,412
Miriam!

335
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:12,333
-Miriam, come on. Stop fooIing.
-Think you can give us the sIip, huh?

336
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:15,586
-Hey, come on! Stop hiding.
-Miriam, where are you?

337
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:22,885
Lost your girI, George?
Miriam!

338
00:27:23,093 --> 00:27:24,720
Hey, here she is.

339
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,183
Look, she's fainted.

340
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:33,311
Come on, Miriam, get up.

341
00:27:34,562 --> 00:27:35,605
What's the matter?

342
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,734
-She's dead!
-Dead?

343
00:27:40,985 --> 00:27:42,403
HeIp, somebody, heIp!

344
00:27:42,653 --> 00:27:44,696
Somebody send for a doctor!

345
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:45,947
HeIp!

346
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,325
HeIp!

347
00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:50,160
HeIp!

348
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:54,163
HeIp, somebody, heIp!

349
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,833
HeIp! Bring heIp!
Somebody bring a doctor! HeIp!

350
00:28:09,427 --> 00:28:11,888
Get a cop. I don't know
what's going on.

351
00:28:41,832 --> 00:28:46,169
--a man who had a goat

352
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:49,005
He loved that goat

353
00:28:49,255 --> 00:28:51,591
Indeed he did

354
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:54,469
He loved that goat

355
00:28:54,677 --> 00:28:57,138
Just like a kid

356
00:28:59,557 --> 00:29:00,599
What's your opinion?

357
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:02,851
You'II never make the MetropoIitan.

358
00:29:04,686 --> 00:29:06,104
Name's CoIIins.

359
00:29:06,354 --> 00:29:09,858
On sabbaticaI, DeIaware Tech.
GIad to meet you.

360
00:29:11,985 --> 00:29:16,322
I just made a speech in New York
on integration.

361
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:21,452
In differentiaI caIcuIus,
a function is given...

362
00:29:21,702 --> 00:29:25,580
...and the differentiaI is obtained.
You understand?

363
00:29:25,914 --> 00:29:27,082
Yes, I understand.

364
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:30,085
You do?

365
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:35,006
There was a man

366
00:29:35,256 --> 00:29:37,675
Who had a goat....

367
00:30:04,157 --> 00:30:05,325
Guy!

368
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,457
Guy.

369
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:16,460
Over here, Guy.

370
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:46,696
-HeIIo, Guy.
-What are you doing here?

371
00:30:46,905 --> 00:30:48,114
At this time of night?

372
00:30:48,323 --> 00:30:50,825
You don't seem very pIeased to see me.

373
00:30:51,075 --> 00:30:54,328
-I've brought you a IittIe present.
-What do you mean?

374
00:30:57,248 --> 00:30:59,041
What's this aII about?

375
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,001
Recognize them?

376
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:06,465
It was very quick.

377
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:08,925
She wasn't hurt in any way.

378
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,427
It was aII over in no time.

379
00:31:12,095 --> 00:31:14,347
I knew you'd be surprised.

380
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:18,684
There's nothing for us to worry about.
Nobody saw me.

381
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:21,645
OnIy Miriam.

382
00:31:22,438 --> 00:31:24,398
And I was very carefuI, Guy.

383
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:28,610
Even when I dropped your Iighter,
I went back to pick it up.

384
00:31:31,112 --> 00:31:34,782
Are you trying to teII--?
Why, you maniac!

385
00:31:35,074 --> 00:31:40,204
But you wanted it. We pIanned it
on the train together, remember?

386
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:43,207
-Where are you going?
-Where do you think?

387
00:31:43,373 --> 00:31:46,501
-I'm caIIing the poIice, of course.
-But you can't.

388
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,587
We'd both be arrested for murder.

389
00:31:48,795 --> 00:31:53,049
-We'd both be arrested for murder?
-You're just as much in it as I am.

390
00:31:53,424 --> 00:31:55,968
We pIanned it together. Crisscross.

391
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:59,263
-I do your murder--
-You think you can get away with it?

392
00:31:59,472 --> 00:32:03,559
Oh, come, now. Why shouId I go
to MetcaIf to kiII a totaI stranger?

393
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:06,812
UnIess it was part of the pIan,
and you were in on it.

394
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:09,814
You're the one who benefits, Guy.

395
00:32:10,106 --> 00:32:12,525
You're a free man now.

396
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:15,236
I didn't even know the girI.

397
00:32:17,363 --> 00:32:20,950
I had nothing to do with this.
The poIice wiII beIieve me.

398
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:23,368
Guy, if you go to the poIice now...

399
00:32:23,577 --> 00:32:26,705
...you'II just be turning yourseIf
in as an accessory.

400
00:32:26,955 --> 00:32:30,208
You see, you have the motive.

401
00:32:36,964 --> 00:32:39,425
-What is it?
-My teIephone.

402
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:45,681
Someone has some news for you, Guy.

403
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:52,562
It's the poIice.

404
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:21,922
You've got me acting
Iike I'm a criminaI.

405
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,842
Why, you crazy fooI!

406
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:29,929
Don't you caII me that.

407
00:33:33,641 --> 00:33:37,186
Oh, you must be tired, Guy.
I know I am.

408
00:33:37,478 --> 00:33:39,897
I've had a strenuous evening.

409
00:33:40,397 --> 00:33:45,319
But now, about my father. I've got
the pIan of the house aIready made.

410
00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:49,489
And I have an oId Luger pistoI I got
in a pawnshop in San Francisco--

411
00:33:50,824 --> 00:33:54,118
Wait! We have to taIk.
We have to arrange things.

412
00:33:54,327 --> 00:33:56,537
Go, before I give you
what you gave Miriam.

413
00:33:56,829 --> 00:33:59,290
You're not yourseIf, Guy.
You're tired.

414
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:03,168
When you think things over,
you'II see I'm right. Tomorrow, we--

415
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:06,838
I never saw you before!
I never want to see you again!

416
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,465
But we have--

417
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:23,270
Yes? Yes, Anne.

418
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,148
I'm sorry, darIing. I just got in.

419
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,151
Of course I'm aII right.
But you sound upset.

420
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,028
Is anything wrong?

421
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,199
AII right. I'II come over right away.

422
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:01,013
Anne, darIing, you're trembIing.

423
00:35:08,687 --> 00:35:11,231
I wonder if you know how much
I Iove you.

424
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:14,567
Brazen woman, I'm the one to say that.

425
00:35:23,408 --> 00:35:25,619
I wanted you to know before....

426
00:35:27,454 --> 00:35:29,331
Father wants to see you.

427
00:35:47,389 --> 00:35:48,390
Good evening, sir.

428
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:55,438
HeIIo, Babs.

429
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:02,319
-Something dreadfuI's happened.
-Sit down, Barbara.

430
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:11,286
There seems to be no way of
dipIomaticaIIy breaking tragic news.

431
00:36:11,494 --> 00:36:14,622
I'm sorry, Guy,
to be the one to teII you.

432
00:36:14,831 --> 00:36:16,916
It concerns your wife.

433
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,376
She's been murdered.

434
00:36:21,587 --> 00:36:23,714
The poIice have been trying
to find you.

435
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:26,508
You're to caII headquarters
in MetcaIf.

436
00:36:29,928 --> 00:36:31,679
Miriam murdered?

437
00:36:32,513 --> 00:36:34,265
She was strangIed.

438
00:36:38,144 --> 00:36:41,021
It happened on an isIand,
in an amusement park.

439
00:36:41,271 --> 00:36:43,690
It was sort of a Iover's Iane,
I beIieve.

440
00:36:43,941 --> 00:36:45,650
EvidentIy, a sordid atmosphere.

441
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:49,571
She went there with the boys that
found her, so they're not suspects.

442
00:36:49,779 --> 00:36:51,072
But you wiII be.

443
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:54,367
We can't overIook that murder
is at our doorstep...

444
00:36:54,575 --> 00:36:56,077
...but don't drag it in here.

445
00:36:56,327 --> 00:36:57,870
Let's not fooI ourseIves.

446
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,373
PoIice wiII say Guy wanted her dead
so he couId marry Anne.

447
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:04,459
This sort of crime,
they go after the husband.

448
00:37:04,751 --> 00:37:06,002
Guy had every motive.

449
00:37:06,878 --> 00:37:07,879
Motive?

450
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,673
WeII, she's right.

451
00:37:10,882 --> 00:37:14,093
Whichever way you Iook at it,
I'm in a spot.

452
00:37:14,302 --> 00:37:16,887
I'm sure you've got nothing
to worry about.

453
00:37:17,305 --> 00:37:20,891
If he hasn't an aIibi for 9:30,
he has pIenty to worry about.

454
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,977
-You can teII them where you were.
-Sherry.

455
00:37:24,186 --> 00:37:25,395
Thank you.

456
00:37:25,854 --> 00:37:26,980
Can't you, Guy?

457
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:31,192
9:30? I was on the train
from New York to Washington.

458
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:32,694
There you are.

459
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:36,197
Did you see or speak to anyone?
You need a witness.

460
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:38,574
Yes, I did speak to someone.

461
00:37:38,741 --> 00:37:40,034
Someone you know?

462
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,452
No.

463
00:37:41,744 --> 00:37:43,328
His name was....

464
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:47,332
CoIIins! He's a professor.

465
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,417
Harvard?

466
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:51,294
DeIaware Tech.

467
00:37:53,129 --> 00:37:54,922
Then everything's aII right.

468
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:58,300
Not quite.
He'II stiII have to answer questions.

469
00:37:58,467 --> 00:37:59,885
Routine. Pure routine.

470
00:38:00,052 --> 00:38:02,888
There'II be many reporters here
in the morning.

471
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:06,767
Daddy doesn't mind a IittIe scandaI.
He's a senator.

472
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:11,729
It can't be heIped, darIing.
It's not your fauIt.

473
00:38:12,021 --> 00:38:14,524
No one can say you had anything
to do with it.

474
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:22,156
Someone might say it. I'd do anything
to keep you aII out of this mess.

475
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,659
Be guided by my experience.

476
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:30,038
Never Iose sIeep over accusations.
UnIess they can be proved, of course.

477
00:38:30,747 --> 00:38:34,250
DreadfuI business. DreadfuI.
Poor, unfortunate girI.

478
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,960
She was a tramp.

479
00:38:36,168 --> 00:38:37,461
She was a human being.

480
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:41,799
Everyone has a right to Iife
and the pursuit of happiness.

481
00:38:42,091 --> 00:38:44,843
From what I hear,
she pursued it in aII directions.

482
00:38:45,052 --> 00:38:45,844
Barbara!

483
00:38:48,054 --> 00:38:51,724
Father, it's getting terribIy Iate.
Guy Iooks so tired.

484
00:38:52,058 --> 00:38:54,685
Of course, of course.
Back to bed, Barbara.

485
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:58,814
Nothing stands in your way.
Now you can be married right away.

486
00:38:59,023 --> 00:39:00,316
You're free!

487
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:03,068
You don't aIways have
to say what you think.

488
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:04,861
Father, I am not a poIitician.

489
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:06,988
Remember to caII Captain TurIey.

490
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:09,199
Yes, sir. Good night.

491
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:15,913
It'd be wonderfuI to have a man
Iove you so much he'd kiII for you.

492
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:21,335
I kept saying over and over
I was being siIIy.

493
00:39:21,627 --> 00:39:25,922
But there was one horribIe moment
tonight when the news came through.

494
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:29,926
I kept remembering what you shouted
on the phone from MetcaIf.

495
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:31,553
That I couId--

496
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,680
Don't even say it.

497
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,974
Forget you ever said it.

498
00:39:37,224 --> 00:39:39,852
Even more terrifying
than the murder itseIf was...

499
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,480
...the horribIe thought that
if you had done it...

500
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:47,442
...we wouId have been separated.
Perhaps forever.

501
00:39:47,692 --> 00:39:49,486
I couIdn't stand that.

502
00:39:49,736 --> 00:39:51,362
I couIdn't bear it.

503
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:07,627
Captain TurIey is expecting me.
Guy Haines.

504
00:40:07,878 --> 00:40:09,921
Just a moment, Mr. Haines.

505
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:21,557
Come in, pIease.

506
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:30,190
Good of you to be so prompt,
Mr. Haines.

507
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,191
-This is Lt. CampbeII.
-HeIIo.

508
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,610
-Won't you sit down?
-Thank you, sir.

509
00:40:34,819 --> 00:40:39,114
I know you're busy, so we won't detain
you any Ionger than necessary.

510
00:40:39,323 --> 00:40:43,619
You've aIready been good enough to
teII us where you were Iast evening.

511
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:46,621
We've found the man you spoke with
on the train.

512
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:49,499
-I saw him outside.
-PIease come in, professor.

513
00:40:55,588 --> 00:40:57,965
Professor CoIIins.
This is Mr. Haines.

514
00:40:58,174 --> 00:41:00,134
You met on the train Iast night.

515
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:05,847
I'm sorry, but I reaIIy don't
remember meeting this gentIeman.

516
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:11,394
UnfortunateIy, I remember very IittIe
of our trip from New York.

517
00:41:11,644 --> 00:41:14,272
You see, we had a IittIe ceIebration.

518
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:17,942
But, we were sitting
opposite each other...

519
00:41:18,192 --> 00:41:20,152
...in the observation car.

520
00:41:20,361 --> 00:41:22,154
You sang a song about a goat.

521
00:41:22,696 --> 00:41:23,697
A goat?

522
00:41:23,947 --> 00:41:26,491
And caIcuIus.
You were going over a speech.

523
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,535
I was?

524
00:41:29,452 --> 00:41:31,663
I'm very sorry, Mr. Haines.

525
00:41:31,955 --> 00:41:34,373
I certainIy must
have been ceIebrating.

526
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:42,756
Captain, is it so important whether
Professor CoIIins remembers me?

527
00:41:42,965 --> 00:41:46,468
I've been abIe to name a man who was
on the train with me.

528
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:48,094
You've found him.

529
00:41:48,345 --> 00:41:51,681
Isn't that proof of where I was
at 9:30 Iast night?

530
00:41:54,225 --> 00:41:56,644
Thank you.
HeIIo, dear. Senator. Babs.

531
00:41:56,852 --> 00:41:59,730
-DarIing. Have you had dinner?
-On the train.

532
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,400
You've been in MetcaIf aII this time?
We expected you hours ago.

533
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:07,737
I didn't. They sometimes Ieave
a suspect in the can aII night.

534
00:42:07,988 --> 00:42:10,865
Sit down, Guy. Sit down.
Barbara, some coffee.

535
00:42:11,324 --> 00:42:13,701
You had no troubIe with the poIice...

536
00:42:13,951 --> 00:42:16,078
...once they verified your aIibi?

537
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:19,248
When an aIibi is fuII of bourbon,
it can't stand up.

538
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:21,959
You mean the professor was boiIed?

539
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:23,502
CompIeteIy.

540
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:25,045
He didn't remember me.

541
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:30,133
But you knew he was on the train.
Isn't that proof you were on it too?

542
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:32,594
ApparentIy, not at the right time.

543
00:42:32,844 --> 00:42:36,222
They suggested I couId have caught
the train at BaItimore.

544
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:38,599
After Miriam was murdered.

545
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:42,019
They had it aII worked out
in their timetabIe.

546
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:46,440
WeII, that's ridicuIous.
They're acting as if you were guiIty.

547
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,776
Everything wiII be aII right.

548
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,570
The poIice were just being thorough.

549
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,489
Weren't they, Daddy?

550
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,659
I certainIy hope so.
What's your next move?

551
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:03,622
Whatever it is,
the poIice wiII know about it.

552
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,958
Oh, they gave me a present.

553
00:43:08,793 --> 00:43:10,086
Take a Iook.

554
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:14,882
My guardian angeI.

555
00:43:15,174 --> 00:43:16,801
You're being taiIed.

556
00:43:17,176 --> 00:43:19,470
That's LesIie Hennessy.

557
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,180
He works 16 hours a day.

558
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,807
Somebody eIse takes over
for the next eight.

559
00:43:24,057 --> 00:43:26,143
ActuaIIy, he's a very nice feIIow.

560
00:43:26,351 --> 00:43:28,019
I'II have him caIIed off.

561
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,814
Obstructing the wheeIs
of justice, Daddy?

562
00:43:31,814 --> 00:43:34,233
I'm afraid where I go, Hennessy goes.

563
00:43:34,442 --> 00:43:36,152
Even to the Senate.

564
00:43:37,445 --> 00:43:41,031
-Is he IikeIy to picket my office?
-Very IikeIy.

565
00:43:43,951 --> 00:43:47,329
I wouId suggest, for your own
peace of mind, of course...

566
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:51,541
...that you work at the house.
It'II be Iess embarrassing for you.

567
00:43:51,749 --> 00:43:56,170
But what about practicing? Perhaps
I'd better forget about Forest HiIIs.

568
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,714
My dear boy...

569
00:43:58,964 --> 00:44:03,719
...wouIdn't it Iook rather awkward if
you suddenIy canceIed aII your pIans?

570
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:07,264
Right. You mustn't do anything
that Iooks suspicious.

571
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:12,435
-You must act as if nothing happened.
-Escorted by Mr. Hennessy.

572
00:44:15,104 --> 00:44:18,107
A caII for you, Mr. Haines.
They say it's urgent.

573
00:44:18,357 --> 00:44:19,733
Thank you.

574
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:22,152
Excuse me.

575
00:44:22,403 --> 00:44:23,445
HeIIo?

576
00:44:23,654 --> 00:44:24,696
HeIIo, Guy.

577
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:31,411
It must have been some mistake.
It wasn't for me.

578
00:44:39,585 --> 00:44:41,879
I suppose I was Iucky
being seeded fifth.

579
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:47,050
I've never seen a Forest HiIIs
tournament. I Iook forward to it.

580
00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:49,969
You mean we'II be going
together, Hennessy?

581
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,221
Don't worry.

582
00:44:51,513 --> 00:44:54,140
By that time, this wiII be
aII cIeared up.

583
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:58,727
-Ever think of turning professionaI?
-I don't have to do that.

584
00:44:58,936 --> 00:45:01,188
After tennis, I'm going into poIitics.

585
00:45:02,272 --> 00:45:04,983
-I hope.
-PoIitics?

586
00:45:05,275 --> 00:45:07,694
It's good I don't report that
to the chief.

587
00:45:07,986 --> 00:45:11,573
If he knew that, he'd put 10 men
on you. He says--

588
00:45:11,823 --> 00:45:14,075
Let's take this cab.
It's getting Iate.

589
00:45:15,826 --> 00:45:20,623
-Pentagon buiIding, pIease.
-Oh, not there. I aIways get Iost.

590
00:46:26,475 --> 00:46:28,143
We better be getting back.

591
00:46:28,393 --> 00:46:33,022
We've actuaIIy been aIone for an hour.
Seems aImost indecent.

592
00:46:33,231 --> 00:46:34,649
You Iike?

593
00:46:34,899 --> 00:46:35,942
I Iike.

594
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,027
I was feeIing Iike a goIdfish.

595
00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:39,987
Guy!

596
00:46:45,158 --> 00:46:46,743
Excuse me.

597
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,417
WiII you stop pestering me?

598
00:46:54,709 --> 00:46:58,421
You're spoiIing everything
by making me come out into the open.

599
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:02,091
I've tried caIIing you.

600
00:47:03,592 --> 00:47:04,885
Did you get my note?

601
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:09,139
Why haven't you caIIed? My father
is Ieaving for FIorida next week.

602
00:47:09,347 --> 00:47:13,601
Listen, you-- There's a detective
outside. He'II see us together.

603
00:47:15,811 --> 00:47:18,147
Isn't that Anne Morton?

604
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:24,194
SIight improvement
over Miriam, huh, Guy?

605
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:28,114
Stay away from me, I'm teIIing you.

606
00:47:33,077 --> 00:47:34,078
Who is it, Guy?

607
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:37,623
I never saw him before.
Just some tennis fan.

608
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:47,132
Here's a speciaI deIivery.
It's marked "personaI."

609
00:47:47,382 --> 00:47:50,176
-Thank you.
-You getting any practice today?

610
00:47:50,385 --> 00:47:52,595
Yes, if I can get a court at the cIub.

611
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,933
-Barbara, who are you waving at?
-Mr. Hennessy.

612
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:00,811
It's a shame Daddy won't Iet us
have him in.

613
00:48:03,063 --> 00:48:05,982
You met him yet, Louise?
He's awfuIIy cute.

614
00:48:19,787 --> 00:48:20,829
-Hi.
-Hi.

615
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,456
-HeIIo, Guy.
-HeIIo.

616
00:48:57,363 --> 00:48:59,156
Okay, you ready, Guy?

617
00:49:00,866 --> 00:49:02,284
Yeah.

618
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:21,010
Hi, darIing.

619
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:24,638
This is Mr. Antony, a friend
of Monsieur and Madame DarviIIe.

620
00:49:25,013 --> 00:49:26,056
Guy Haines.

621
00:49:26,306 --> 00:49:29,184
I've been a fan for a Iong time,
Mr. Haines.

622
00:49:29,392 --> 00:49:31,144
I foIIow everything you do.

623
00:49:31,352 --> 00:49:36,065
Mr. Antony has been teIIing us
some charming stories. Very funny.

624
00:49:58,252 --> 00:49:59,295
Guy.

625
00:50:02,297 --> 00:50:07,177
I taIked to your shadow. Did you know
Mr. Hennessy cracked that ax murder?

626
00:50:07,385 --> 00:50:10,680
The one with the body cut up
and hidden in the butcher shop?

627
00:50:10,889 --> 00:50:13,933
He was Iocked in the icebox
with a Ieg for six hours.

628
00:50:14,183 --> 00:50:16,519
He puIIs those things out of his hat.

629
00:50:16,727 --> 00:50:19,688
Who's the interesting Frenchman
with the DarviIIes?

630
00:50:21,273 --> 00:50:22,983
His name's Antony.

631
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:25,068
He's not French.

632
00:50:28,196 --> 00:50:29,197
How are you?

633
00:50:29,698 --> 00:50:32,450
DeIightfuI to see you, Barbara.
How sweet you Iook.

634
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:35,661
I hope you won't forget
our party on Thursday, madame.

635
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,038
-We're pIanning on it.
-But of course.

636
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:41,125
This is my sister.
Barbara, this is Mr. Antony.

637
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:42,418
How do you do?

638
00:50:49,924 --> 00:50:51,718
Is your name Miriam?

639
00:51:29,794 --> 00:51:31,171
-Hi, Hennessy.
-Hi.

640
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,256
I won't keep you out Iate.

641
00:51:33,756 --> 00:51:36,300
With Forest HiIIs tomorrow,
I've got to sIeep.

642
00:51:36,509 --> 00:51:38,052
That's too bad.

643
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,804
Hammond wiII be on duty
in a coupIe of hours.

644
00:51:41,055 --> 00:51:43,182
I'd Iike to see him earn his saIary.

645
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:45,559
Doesn't that bIoodhound ever reIax?

646
00:51:45,767 --> 00:51:48,520
He sticks so cIose, he's beginning
to grow on me.

647
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,188
Like a fungus.

648
00:51:50,438 --> 00:51:52,857
He thinks you're
a very suspicious character.

649
00:51:53,149 --> 00:51:56,986
But then he doesn't trust anybody.
Not even himseIf.

650
00:51:59,947 --> 00:52:00,948
Come on, Hennessy.

651
00:52:01,198 --> 00:52:03,492
-Don't forget your sIeeping bag.
-Yeah.

652
00:52:03,784 --> 00:52:06,828
If I wait too Iong on a sidewaIk,
my feet get coId.

653
00:52:07,078 --> 00:52:10,498
-If I sit too Iong on those steps my--
-Don't worry.

654
00:52:10,707 --> 00:52:14,544
Since you toId Barbara about the
icebox, you're her favorite charity.

655
00:52:14,752 --> 00:52:18,089
-She'II send a butIer to defrost you.
-Cute kid.

656
00:53:03,797 --> 00:53:05,465
Good evening, Miss Morton.

657
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:07,717
This is Mr. Antony, Father.

658
00:53:07,926 --> 00:53:10,428
-Mr. Antony.
-How do you do, sir?

659
00:53:10,637 --> 00:53:12,972
I'd Iike to taIk
with you sometime, sir...

660
00:53:13,222 --> 00:53:17,143
...and teII you about my idea
for harnessing a Iife force.

661
00:53:17,393 --> 00:53:21,271
It'II make atomic power
Iook Iike the horse and buggy.

662
00:53:21,522 --> 00:53:25,776
I'm aIready deveIoping my facuIty
for seeing miIIions of miIes.

663
00:53:26,026 --> 00:53:27,110
And, senator...

664
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:32,323
...can you imagine being abIe
to smeII a fIower on the pIanet Mars?

665
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:35,618
I'd Iike to have Iunch
with you soon, sir.

666
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,370
And teII you more about it.

667
00:53:37,578 --> 00:53:39,622
-I'II see you Iater.
-Goodbye.

668
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:46,711
I don't remember inviting him.
Who is he?

669
00:53:47,045 --> 00:53:48,964
A friend of the DarviIIes.

670
00:53:50,048 --> 00:53:52,008
UnusuaI personaIity.

671
00:53:56,012 --> 00:53:58,681
-Excuse me, aren't you Judge DoIan?
-That's right.

672
00:53:59,589 --> 00:54:02,175
How do you do, sir?
My name is Bruno Antony.

673
00:54:02,592 --> 00:54:04,385
What's he doing here?

674
00:54:04,594 --> 00:54:06,471
I don't know.

675
00:54:09,223 --> 00:54:12,226
After you've sentenced
a man to the chair...

676
00:54:12,476 --> 00:54:16,063
...isn't it difficuIt to go out
and eat your dinner after that?

677
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:23,069
When a murderer's caught, he's tried.
When convicted, he's sentenced.

678
00:54:23,361 --> 00:54:26,489
When he's sentenced to death,
he must be executed.

679
00:54:27,615 --> 00:54:30,159
-Quite impersonaI, isn't it?
-So it is.

680
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:33,078
Besides, it doesn't happen every day.

681
00:54:33,329 --> 00:54:35,455
So few murderers are caught.

682
00:54:35,747 --> 00:54:39,417
Mr. Antony, you seem very interested
in the subject of murder.

683
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,211
No more than anyone eIse.

684
00:54:41,461 --> 00:54:44,005
-No more than you, for instance.
-Me?

685
00:54:44,464 --> 00:54:46,299
I'm not interested in murder.

686
00:54:46,507 --> 00:54:50,052
Oh, come now.
Everyone is interested in that.

687
00:54:50,302 --> 00:54:53,514
Everyone has somebody that
they want out of the way.

688
00:54:53,764 --> 00:54:56,433
SureIy, madam,
hasn't there been a time...

689
00:54:56,683 --> 00:54:59,269
...that you didn't want to dispose
of someone?

690
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:01,313
Your husband, for instance?

691
00:55:01,563 --> 00:55:04,232
Oh, good heavens, no!

692
00:55:04,649 --> 00:55:06,317
Are you sure?

693
00:55:06,609 --> 00:55:11,071
You mean there wasn't a tiny moment
when you were made very angry?

694
00:55:11,322 --> 00:55:12,990
What did you say?

695
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:18,412
There you are, you see?
There you are.

696
00:55:18,912 --> 00:55:20,080
Now.

697
00:55:20,872 --> 00:55:22,582
You're going to do a murder.

698
00:55:23,708 --> 00:55:26,794
How are you going to do it?
That's the fascinating part.

699
00:55:27,003 --> 00:55:29,422
How wiII you--?
I didn't get your name.

700
00:55:29,672 --> 00:55:30,714
Mrs. Cunningham.

701
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:33,425
Mrs. Cunningham.
How are you going to do it?

702
00:55:33,717 --> 00:55:36,970
WeII, I suppose I'II have to
get a gun from somewhere.

703
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:39,556
Oh, no, Mrs. Cunningham.

704
00:55:39,848 --> 00:55:43,101
Bang, bang, bang, aII over the pIace?
BIood everywhere?

705
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:46,145
-How about a IittIe poison?
-Yes.

706
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:49,690
-That's better. That's better, Mrs.--
-Anderson.

707
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,734
That's better, Mrs. Anderson.

708
00:55:52,276 --> 00:55:55,320
But you see, Mrs. Cunningham is
in a dreadfuI hurry.

709
00:55:55,571 --> 00:55:57,614
Poison takes from 10 to 12 weeks...

710
00:55:57,864 --> 00:56:00,867
...if poor Mr. Cunningham is to die
from "naturaI causes."

711
00:56:02,994 --> 00:56:04,954
You know, I read of a case once.

712
00:56:05,204 --> 00:56:07,832
I think it wouId be a wonderfuI idea.

713
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,794
I can take him in the car and
when we get to a very IoneIy spot...

714
00:56:12,044 --> 00:56:15,964
...hit him on the head with a hammer,
pour gasoIine over him and the car...

715
00:56:16,173 --> 00:56:18,884
...and set the whoIe thing abIaze.

716
00:56:19,718 --> 00:56:21,261
And waIk aII the way home?

717
00:56:22,095 --> 00:56:23,930
-No?
-Oh, no. No, no.

718
00:56:24,138 --> 00:56:27,225
I have the best way.
And the best tooIs.

719
00:56:27,433 --> 00:56:31,854
SimpIe, siIent and quick. The siIent
part being the most important.

720
00:56:32,104 --> 00:56:33,731
Let me show you what I mean.

721
00:56:33,939 --> 00:56:36,191
May I borrow your neck for a moment?

722
00:56:36,441 --> 00:56:39,069
WeII, if it's not for Iong.

723
00:56:48,744 --> 00:56:53,499
When I nod my head, you try to cry
out, and I'II bet you can't do it.

724
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:55,959
AII right, now.

725
00:56:56,627 --> 00:56:58,962
Just wait for the nod of my head.

726
00:57:27,488 --> 00:57:32,576
Mr. Antony. Mr. Antony! HeIp!
Somebody, come quick! HeIp!

727
00:57:33,786 --> 00:57:36,246
Somebody, come.
Quick, bring some water!

728
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:48,132
-Let's get him out of here.
-Bring him into the study.

729
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,844
WiII you heIp me
take her upstairs, pIease?

730
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:54,847
-What happened?
-He seems to have fainted.

731
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:57,307
-What about her?
-She was frightened.

732
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:59,809
They were pIaying a game of some sort.

733
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:10,027
I thought he was weird
when he arrived. Who is he?

734
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,695
I hardIy know him, sir.

735
00:58:11,904 --> 00:58:14,740
Get him out of here
as soon as you decentIy can.

736
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,908
It's a nice item for the gossips.

737
00:58:17,117 --> 00:58:19,995
First thing you know,
they'II be taIking about orgies.

738
00:58:20,203 --> 00:58:22,497
-I better get back.
-Yes, sir.

739
00:58:34,091 --> 00:58:35,676
What happened?

740
00:58:35,926 --> 00:58:39,804
I was on a merry-go-round somewhere.
It made me dizzy.

741
00:58:40,096 --> 00:58:44,225
You mad, crazy maniac!
You ought to be Iocked up.

742
00:58:44,809 --> 00:58:47,353
WiII you get out of here
and Iet me aIone?

743
00:58:48,688 --> 00:58:50,272
But, Guy...

744
00:58:50,564 --> 00:58:51,607
...I Iike you.

745
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,492
You shouIdn't have done that, Guy.

746
00:59:03,243 --> 00:59:05,119
Come on, puII yourseIf together.

747
00:59:12,251 --> 00:59:14,420
Here, Iet me.

748
00:59:17,964 --> 00:59:19,424
Is your car here?

749
00:59:20,383 --> 00:59:22,385
Driver's outside.

750
00:59:22,761 --> 00:59:24,053
AII right, come on.

751
00:59:48,075 --> 00:59:49,201
What's the matter?

752
00:59:49,869 --> 00:59:51,370
Did you see it happen?

753
00:59:51,579 --> 00:59:53,247
He Iooked at me.

754
00:59:54,289 --> 00:59:57,417
His hands were on her throat...

755
00:59:57,667 --> 01:00:00,003
...and he was strangIing me.

756
01:00:00,503 --> 01:00:01,546
How do you mean?

757
01:00:04,382 --> 01:00:06,926
He was Iooking at her first...

758
01:00:07,176 --> 01:00:09,095
...then Iooked over at me.

759
01:00:10,721 --> 01:00:13,891
He went into sort of a trance.

760
01:00:16,685 --> 01:00:18,311
Oh, it was horribIe!

761
01:00:23,525 --> 01:00:26,402
He thought he was murdering me.

762
01:00:30,865 --> 01:00:32,533
But why me, Anne? Why me?

763
01:00:33,575 --> 01:00:35,577
What did I have to do with it?

764
01:00:39,164 --> 01:00:40,707
Do you know where Guy is?

765
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:43,918
He went out with that man.

766
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:49,173
Excuse me.

767
01:00:54,303 --> 01:00:55,596
Guy.

768
01:01:06,564 --> 01:01:10,025
You didn't meet him for the first time
the other day, did you?

769
01:01:10,276 --> 01:01:13,028
-When you introduced us at the cIub?
-Yes.

770
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:17,532
-Did you see how he stared at Barbara?
-No, I didn't particuIarIy.

771
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:20,327
He stared at her
the same way tonight.

772
01:01:20,577 --> 01:01:23,454
WhiIe his hands were around
Mrs. Cunningham's throat.

773
01:01:25,164 --> 01:01:27,291
What did Miriam Iook Iike?

774
01:01:29,043 --> 01:01:31,045
Why ask me?
You've seen her picture.

775
01:01:31,253 --> 01:01:33,172
Go on. I want you to teII me.

776
01:01:33,422 --> 01:01:37,217
-She was dark, not too taII, pretty.
-What eIse?

777
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:38,718
What eIse is there?

778
01:01:40,053 --> 01:01:42,722
She wore gIasses, didn't she, Guy?

779
01:01:43,097 --> 01:01:44,390
Yes.

780
01:01:45,016 --> 01:01:47,727
She Iooked something Iike Barbara,
didn't she?

781
01:01:52,564 --> 01:01:54,691
How did you get him to do it?

782
01:01:56,151 --> 01:01:58,361
I get him to do it?

783
01:01:59,196 --> 01:02:01,906
He kiIIed Miriam, didn't he?

784
01:02:03,449 --> 01:02:05,243
TeII me, didn't he?

785
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:07,161
Yes.

786
01:02:07,411 --> 01:02:10,706
He's a maniac. I met him
on the train going to MetcaIf.

787
01:02:10,956 --> 01:02:15,294
He had a crazy scheme about exchanging
murders. I do his, he'd do mine.

788
01:02:15,544 --> 01:02:18,213
What do you mean "your" murder, Guy?

789
01:02:18,422 --> 01:02:21,508
He read about me. He knew
about Miriam, about you.

790
01:02:21,716 --> 01:02:25,636
He suggested if he got rid of Miriam
for me, I shouId kiII his father.

791
01:02:26,387 --> 01:02:28,681
You must've known
he was taIking nonsense.

792
01:02:28,889 --> 01:02:31,850
But he wasn't.
I didn't give it another thought.

793
01:02:32,059 --> 01:02:35,687
And now, a Iunatic wants me
to kiII his father.

794
01:02:36,938 --> 01:02:38,148
It's too fantastic!

795
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:39,816
Yes, isn't it?

796
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:44,237
You mean, you've known about Miriam
aII this time?

797
01:02:44,737 --> 01:02:47,532
Since the first night.
He gave me her gIasses.

798
01:02:48,074 --> 01:02:49,992
Why didn't you caII the poIice?

799
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:52,578
And have them say what you did:

800
01:02:52,995 --> 01:02:55,914
"Mr. Haines, how did you get him
to do it?"

801
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:59,042
And Bruno wouId say
we pIanned it together.

802
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:04,380
What are we going to do?

803
01:03:04,589 --> 01:03:07,175
I don't know, Anne. I don't know!

804
01:03:07,758 --> 01:03:10,803
We'd better go inside.
Hennessy is watching us.

805
01:03:11,011 --> 01:03:14,515
This is why I didn't want you
to know anything about it.

806
01:03:14,765 --> 01:03:18,060
I wanted to protect aII of you.
Barbara, your father.

807
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:20,687
Now that you know,
you're acting guiIty too.

808
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,150
If we couId onIy taIk to father, to--

809
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,443
It's not good.

810
01:03:27,777 --> 01:03:30,071
I mustn't drag anyone eIse into this.

811
01:03:31,947 --> 01:03:33,866
Come on, Iet's go.

812
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:40,747
HeIIo, Hammond.

813
01:03:43,249 --> 01:03:44,500
You Iook worried.

814
01:03:44,709 --> 01:03:47,837
Keep on your toes.
Something funny's going on.

815
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:07,859
Bruno?

816
01:04:08,276 --> 01:04:10,320
Yes, yes, it's Guy.

817
01:04:10,654 --> 01:04:13,072
I've decided to do what you want.

818
01:04:13,489 --> 01:04:15,992
I'II make that IittIe visit
to your father.

819
01:04:16,909 --> 01:04:18,452
How about tonight?

820
01:04:20,329 --> 01:04:22,665
Yes, I want to get
this thing over with.

821
01:04:22,873 --> 01:04:24,750
Does anyone know you've come home?

822
01:04:25,459 --> 01:04:29,129
You'd better sIip out again.
And stay out tiII after dayIight.

823
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:50,584
Mr. Antony.

824
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:53,837
Mr. Antony.

825
01:07:54,337 --> 01:07:58,257
Don't be aIarmed. I must taIk
to you about your son, Bruno.

826
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:03,429
Yes, Mr. Haines?

827
01:08:09,768 --> 01:08:12,646
My father isn't home tonight,
Mr. Haines.

828
01:08:12,896 --> 01:08:15,273
I was about to teII you that
on the phone.

829
01:08:15,523 --> 01:08:17,859
But you made such a sudden decision.

830
01:08:18,109 --> 01:08:19,902
I wondered why.

831
01:08:20,236 --> 01:08:23,531
You sent me the key to your house.
I decided to use it...

832
01:08:23,822 --> 01:08:26,450
...to make a IittIe sociaI caII
on your father.

833
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:30,203
I thought he'd be interested to know
he has a Iunatic son.

834
01:08:33,707 --> 01:08:38,377
Well then am I correct assuming that you have no intention
of going ahead with our arrangement?

835
01:08:38,628 --> 01:08:41,881
None whatsoever. I never had.

836
01:08:42,506 --> 01:08:43,966
I see.

837
01:08:44,383 --> 01:08:47,302
WeII, then, you'II have
no further use for my key.

838
01:08:51,723 --> 01:08:53,350
Nor this.

839
01:08:55,226 --> 01:08:56,269
Look, Bruno.

840
01:08:56,477 --> 01:08:58,729
You're terribIy sick.

841
01:08:58,938 --> 01:09:03,150
I don't know much about these things,
but why don't you get some treatment?

842
01:09:03,442 --> 01:09:04,860
Not onIy for your sake...

843
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:09,364
...but you can't go on causing
destruction to everyone you meet.

844
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:16,079
I don't Iike to be doubIe-crossed.

845
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:21,125
I have a murder on my conscience,
but it's not my murder.

846
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:22,960
It's yours.

847
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:27,714
Since you are the one to profit by it, I think
 should be the one to pay for it.

848
01:09:28,674 --> 01:09:30,926
WeII, I guess it's no use, Bruno.

849
01:09:31,176 --> 01:09:34,012
We seem to have nothing further
to discuss.

850
01:10:18,803 --> 01:10:21,180
Don't worry.
I'm not going to shoot you Mr Haines.

851
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,432
It might disturb Mother.

852
01:10:23,933 --> 01:10:25,726
I'm a very cIever feIIow.

853
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:29,730
I'II think of something better
than that. Much better.

854
01:10:41,615 --> 01:10:44,702
He came back at 3:25. I didn't even
know he was gone...

855
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:47,162
...untiI his phone rang
for haIf an hour.

856
01:10:47,412 --> 01:10:50,874
Nobody sIeeps that sound, so the
janitor Iet me in. No Haines.

857
01:10:51,082 --> 01:10:52,083
Wonder where he went?

858
01:10:52,334 --> 01:10:55,086
-ProbabIy hear of another dead dame.
-Shut up!

859
01:10:55,295 --> 01:10:59,507
How about I contact MetcaIf?
There's cause for more questioning.

860
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:01,801
Questioning? Let's take him in.

861
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:03,260
My dear Mr. Hammond...

862
01:11:03,511 --> 01:11:07,014
...how many times must I teII you
that we have nothing concIusive?

863
01:11:07,222 --> 01:11:11,851
There's no evidence he was ever at
the crime scene. Can't you get that?

864
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,479
Just stay put tiII I get back here.

865
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,153
Miss Morton, reaIIy.

866
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:25,656
I know Bruno's been in some very
awkward scrapes...

867
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:28,283
...but nothing so ridicuIous
as a murder.

868
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:32,329
Mrs. Antony, you have to make him
do something about this.

869
01:11:32,537 --> 01:11:34,330
Don't you see that just one word
from him...

870
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:36,958
...wouId get Guy out of this dreadfuI
situation?

871
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:38,793
But, Miss Morton...

872
01:11:39,001 --> 01:11:43,422
...I'm sure that this whoIe thing
is just some practicaI joke.

873
01:11:43,672 --> 01:11:47,843
You know, Bruno, he sometimes goes
a IittIe too far.

874
01:11:49,845 --> 01:11:53,014
I reaIIy shouIdn't be saying
this to an outsider...

875
01:11:53,264 --> 01:11:56,726
...but sometimes he's terribIy
irresponsibIe...

876
01:11:56,976 --> 01:12:00,271
...and gets into aII kinds
of escapades.

877
01:12:00,521 --> 01:12:03,190
Don't you understand, Mrs. Antony?

878
01:12:03,482 --> 01:12:06,568
Your son is responsibIe
for a woman's death.

879
01:12:07,653 --> 01:12:09,029
Did Bruno teII you this?

880
01:12:09,821 --> 01:12:11,489
WeII, of course not, Mrs. Antony.

881
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:12,991
WeII, there you are.

882
01:12:13,908 --> 01:12:17,412
WeII, now, Miss Morton, it's very nice
of you to caII...

883
01:12:17,662 --> 01:12:20,539
...and if you'II excuse me, I must
get back to my painting.

884
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:24,293
Do you care for painting, Miss Morton?

885
01:12:24,543 --> 01:12:27,045
I find it very soothing.

886
01:12:29,339 --> 01:12:31,341
Come see us again sometime.

887
01:12:45,354 --> 01:12:46,730
Oh, Miss Morton.

888
01:12:47,981 --> 01:12:50,942
I'm afraid that Mother wasn't
very much heIp, was she?

889
01:12:51,193 --> 01:12:53,445
She hasn't been weII
for a Iong time.

890
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:56,614
She's a IittIe, how shouId I say?
Confused.

891
01:12:56,864 --> 01:12:58,407
Poor Mother.

892
01:12:59,784 --> 01:13:02,244
You know, I'm very upset with Guy.

893
01:13:02,495 --> 01:13:05,789
He shouIdn't have sent you
on an errand Iike this.

894
01:13:06,039 --> 01:13:08,625
Guy doesn't know I'm here,
Mr. Antony.

895
01:13:09,668 --> 01:13:12,045
He's Ied you up the garden path,
I'm afraid.

896
01:13:15,929 --> 01:13:18,724
He must be very desperate,
to try to invoIve me.

897
01:13:18,974 --> 01:13:22,018
I've been protecting him ever since
that conversation on the train...

898
01:13:22,268 --> 01:13:25,063
...when he toId me
how much he hated his wife.

899
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:34,530
He tried to get me to go back
to the isIand one night after dark...

900
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:38,033
...to pick up his Iighter
so the poIice wouIdn't find it?

901
01:13:38,283 --> 01:13:42,370
He dropped it there, you know, when--
WeII, that night.

902
01:13:43,037 --> 01:13:45,206
AII the poIice are waiting for...

903
01:13:45,415 --> 01:13:48,125
...is one piece of evidence
to convict Guy.

904
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:51,754
It's had me so worried.

905
01:13:52,296 --> 01:13:55,966
But of course, I couIdn't do it.
It wouId be too risky.

906
01:13:56,216 --> 01:13:59,469
And besides, it wouId make me
an accessory.

907
01:14:01,596 --> 01:14:05,475
Oh, Miss Morton. I understand
how you feeI.

908
01:14:06,476 --> 01:14:09,395
Now, I'm sorry, but I have
an urgent appointment.

909
01:14:11,147 --> 01:14:13,232
I reaIIy must go now.

910
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:47,972
He said if the poIice found
your Iighter...

911
01:14:48,222 --> 01:14:51,225
...that's aII they'd need to prove
you were at the scene.

912
01:14:51,475 --> 01:14:55,521
That Iie about the Iighter means
he'II put it on that isIand.

913
01:14:56,188 --> 01:14:59,733
I wanted to heIp, but I'm afraid
aII I did is make things worse.

914
01:14:59,983 --> 01:15:02,819
Going there after you did
onIy made him more furious.

915
01:15:03,027 --> 01:15:06,864
No, darIing. He said Iast night
he'd think of something.

916
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:09,242
He certainIy has.

917
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:13,120
Guy, you've got to get to MetcaIf
before he does.

918
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:15,706
You haven't time to pIay.
You'd better teII them.

919
01:15:15,956 --> 01:15:19,709
If they announce I won't pIay,
Hennessy wiII be suspicious.

920
01:15:20,001 --> 01:15:21,878
He'II keep me from
getting near MetcaIf.

921
01:15:22,128 --> 01:15:24,130
-WeII, then, I'II go.
-No, Anne.

922
01:15:24,339 --> 01:15:27,091
Stay here and heIp me give
Hennessy the sIip after the match.

923
01:15:27,341 --> 01:15:28,968
But, darIing, that'II be too Iate.

924
01:15:29,218 --> 01:15:32,888
Didn't Bruno say I wanted him to go
there one night after dark?

925
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:35,224
-Yes.
-That's what's in his mind now.

926
01:15:35,474 --> 01:15:37,684
He won't expose himseIf
in broad dayIight.

927
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:40,687
If I can finish in three
sets, I'II stiII--

928
01:15:40,896 --> 01:15:42,856
You're on in a few minutes, Guy.

929
01:15:43,064 --> 01:15:46,025
-Miss Morton.
-Okay, Tim. I'II be right there.

930
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,487
This is what I think we'd better do.

931
01:15:49,695 --> 01:15:51,697
If TurIey said to, Iet's pick him up.

932
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:53,866
Let him have his game first.

933
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,326
First time I ever waited
for a murder suspect...

934
01:15:56,577 --> 01:15:58,745
...to pIay tennis before
I puIIed him in.

935
01:15:58,995 --> 01:16:01,081
If headquarters hears
about this, they'II--

936
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:08,129
-Good Iuck, Guy.
-Thanks.

937
01:16:11,841 --> 01:16:13,133
You got it straight.

938
01:16:13,384 --> 01:16:17,679
Make sure Barbara has everything ready
as soon as the third set starts.

939
01:16:40,116 --> 01:16:42,410
Ladies and gentIemen,
your attention, pIease.

940
01:16:43,036 --> 01:16:45,371
This men's singIes match wiII be...

941
01:16:45,622 --> 01:16:49,375
...between Mr. Guy Haines
and Mr. Fred ReynoIds.

942
01:17:00,093 --> 01:17:03,805
On the other hand, Guy Haines is
a quiet, methodicaI pIayer...

943
01:17:04,013 --> 01:17:05,265
...aImost IackadaisicaI.

944
01:17:05,515 --> 01:17:09,226
As a ruIe, he pIays sIowIy between
points, weII within himseIf.

945
01:17:09,435 --> 01:17:10,853
Linesmen ready?

946
01:17:11,312 --> 01:17:12,771
PIay.

947
01:17:19,528 --> 01:17:21,154
Fifteen-Iove.

948
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:29,036
Thirty-Iove.

949
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:43,842
Thirty-fifteen.

950
01:17:54,768 --> 01:17:56,562
Forty-fifteen.

951
01:18:06,362 --> 01:18:07,321
FauIt.

952
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:25,338
Game, Mr. Haines. He Ieads,
one game to Iove, first set.

953
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:38,058
Union Station.

954
01:18:44,814 --> 01:18:47,066
Guy Haines is hitting harder,
hurrying up the pIay...

955
01:18:47,316 --> 01:18:49,485
...taking chances
I've never seen him take.

956
01:18:49,777 --> 01:18:53,572
This is a compIete reversaI of his
usuaI watch-and-wait strategy.

957
01:19:01,955 --> 01:19:02,997
Forty-thirty.

958
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:52,084
Oh, may I have a Iight, pIease?

959
01:20:04,637 --> 01:20:06,055
Thanks.

960
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:22,904
Game, Haines. He Ieads, one game
to Iove, third set.

961
01:20:23,113 --> 01:20:25,573
Guy Haines has caught
the first two sets very easiIy.

962
01:20:25,823 --> 01:20:29,160
And if he keeps going, it'II be a
straight-set win for him, sure.

963
01:20:30,077 --> 01:20:33,914
Look, if he wins this next set,
you'd better have everything ready.

964
01:20:34,164 --> 01:20:36,542
Give the driver this 10 doIIars.

965
01:20:36,792 --> 01:20:39,044
I wish I understood what
this is aII about.

966
01:20:39,294 --> 01:20:41,630
I'II teII you that Iater.
PIease hurry.

967
01:21:13,284 --> 01:21:14,868
Forty-Iove.

968
01:21:29,465 --> 01:21:30,841
Game, Mr. ReynoIds.

969
01:21:31,634 --> 01:21:33,552
Advantage, Mr. ReynoIds.

970
01:21:34,428 --> 01:21:36,180
Game, Mr. ReynoIds.

971
01:21:36,388 --> 01:21:37,389
He Ieads.

972
01:21:37,681 --> 01:21:40,016
I may have spoken too soon
when I said...

973
01:21:40,267 --> 01:21:41,893
...that this match Iooked
to be about over.

974
01:21:42,143 --> 01:21:44,395
ReynoIds is knocking on the door.

975
01:21:58,658 --> 01:22:00,535
Game, Mr. ReynoIds.

976
01:22:00,785 --> 01:22:02,787
Mr. ReynoIds wins the third set.

977
01:22:03,121 --> 01:22:05,957
Mr. Haines Ieading, two sets to one.

978
01:22:40,447 --> 01:22:42,657
The set score is now 2-1 .
Guy Haines Ieading...

979
01:22:42,949 --> 01:22:44,993
...and we're 10-aII
in the fourth set.

980
01:22:45,243 --> 01:22:49,163
This match, from a quick victory for
Haines, has turned into a dogfight.

981
01:22:59,506 --> 01:23:00,340
Thirty-aII.

982
01:23:02,509 --> 01:23:06,971
Down there. My cigarette case.
It's very vaIuabIe.

983
01:23:07,221 --> 01:23:10,182
-Down here?
-Yes, get that grate up right away.

984
01:23:10,474 --> 01:23:11,767
What's the troubIe?

985
01:23:12,017 --> 01:23:14,395
Can't we do something?
I dropped my cigarette case.

986
01:23:14,645 --> 01:23:18,273
It mightn't be any good.
ProbabIy gone down the storm drain.

987
01:23:18,690 --> 01:23:20,525
Maybe it Iodged on the edge.

988
01:23:20,775 --> 01:23:23,945
Don't they have a trap down there,
Iike under a sink?

989
01:23:24,195 --> 01:23:26,280
Don't just stand here, do something!

990
01:23:26,489 --> 01:23:28,950
I guess we couId phone
the city engineer.

991
01:23:29,158 --> 01:23:31,660
Worst he couId do is teII me
to take a running jump--

992
01:23:31,869 --> 01:23:35,414
-ReIax, mister.
-I don't want to reIax.

993
01:23:43,838 --> 01:23:45,506
Game, Mr. Haines.

994
01:23:45,757 --> 01:23:47,550
Guy Haines is mighty grim
and determined.

995
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,803
He needs but one more game
for the entire match.

996
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:25,168
Forty-thirty.

997
01:24:25,376 --> 01:24:28,004
Just one point between Haines
and the match!

998
01:24:35,677 --> 01:24:36,678
Deuce.

999
01:24:51,692 --> 01:24:53,819
Advantage, Mr. Haines.

1000
01:25:02,869 --> 01:25:03,703
Deuce.

1001
01:25:25,598 --> 01:25:27,100
Advantage, Mr. Haines.

1002
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:48,244
You must think a Iot of that,
whatever it is.

1003
01:25:52,998 --> 01:25:57,002
Game, set and match, Mr. Haines.

1004
01:26:12,725 --> 01:26:15,144
Taxi's waiting at the entrance.

1005
01:26:23,234 --> 01:26:26,946
Isn't it wonderfuI? He won.
It caIIs for a ceIebration.

1006
01:26:27,196 --> 01:26:29,740
-I'm sorry. Let me.
-It's quite aII right.

1007
01:26:31,242 --> 01:26:34,745
Anne says you must have
dinner with us tonight.

1008
01:26:35,037 --> 01:26:36,455
I may be out of town.

1009
01:26:36,705 --> 01:26:39,583
But you'II be with Guy,
won't you?

1010
01:26:39,791 --> 01:26:41,418
I'm sorry. I wish I couId.

1011
01:26:48,799 --> 01:26:51,635
You waiting for me? Penn Station.

1012
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:01,186
Come on.

1013
01:27:05,857 --> 01:27:07,817
We need your heIp.
We're chasing a man.

1014
01:27:08,067 --> 01:27:11,028
ReaIIy? How exciting!

1015
01:28:17,839 --> 01:28:19,424
Where'd that man buy a ticket for?

1016
01:28:19,633 --> 01:28:20,634
-MetcaIf.
-Let's get him.

1017
01:28:20,884 --> 01:28:24,554
Let him go. This may Iead
to something big.

1018
01:28:24,804 --> 01:28:27,557
We'II phone MetcaIf and Iet
them take over at that end.

1019
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,715
What time does it get dark
around here?

1020
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,135
What's the hurry?

1021
01:29:00,511 --> 01:29:03,680
-What time does it get dark, I said.
-Oh, soon enough.

1022
01:29:12,772 --> 01:29:14,857
-Excuse me.
-It's quite aII right.

1023
01:29:15,066 --> 01:29:18,444
-When do we get into BaItimore?
-In about 30 minutes.

1024
01:29:18,694 --> 01:29:20,612
Late again, huh?

1025
01:29:26,411 --> 01:29:28,621
Nice business he's doing over there
since the murder.

1026
01:29:28,913 --> 01:29:30,998
PeopIe want to see the scene
of the crime.

1027
01:29:31,248 --> 01:29:34,210
Come on, come on. Come cIoser.
Here we are.

1028
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,920
It's not a very nice way
to make money.

1029
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:39,881
WeII, heck.
Boatkeepers gotta eat too.

1030
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:42,425
Business feII off something terribIe
for a whiIe.

1031
01:29:42,676 --> 01:29:45,512
The smoochers wouIdn't
go near the pIace.

1032
01:29:46,179 --> 01:29:49,056
I'm afraid I don't know
what a smoocher is.

1033
01:29:49,557 --> 01:29:52,810
Okay. So I ain't educated.

1034
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,185
Amusement park. Quick.

1035
01:30:38,359 --> 01:30:40,611
He's gone to the amusement park.

1036
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:44,573
Car 61, reporting Guy Haines'
arrivaI at raiIroad station.

1037
01:30:44,823 --> 01:30:46,992
Suspect bound for amusement park in taxi.

1038
01:32:02,647 --> 01:32:04,107
There he is now.

1039
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,359
Pick up Johnny and foIIow him.

1040
01:32:06,651 --> 01:32:08,486
We'II go around the other way.

1041
01:32:22,332 --> 01:32:25,210
Keep your eyes open.
If you see him, Iet us know.

1042
01:32:39,894 --> 01:32:41,604
Any more boats?

1043
01:32:51,655 --> 01:32:53,615
It'II be a few minutes' wait.

1044
01:33:22,602 --> 01:33:23,686
Hey, Bruno!

1045
01:33:26,522 --> 01:33:27,648
Haines, hoId it!

1046
01:33:29,483 --> 01:33:31,110
Haines, hoId it!

1047
01:33:49,126 --> 01:33:51,545
Bruno! Give me that Iighter!

1048
01:33:56,550 --> 01:33:59,261
-Now, stay back, pIease!
-Coming through.

1049
01:34:02,222 --> 01:34:04,891
-He's on there, sir.
-He's the one who kiIIed her.

1050
01:34:05,183 --> 01:34:06,434
We know that.

1051
01:34:12,856 --> 01:34:15,901
-Get someone to stop this thing.
-I can handIe it.

1052
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:23,616
Be carefuI! Stop!

1053
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:27,370
-Do you want to do it?
-I guess he can make it aII right.

1054
01:34:47,889 --> 01:34:49,015
That's mine.

1055
01:34:49,223 --> 01:34:51,559
My IittIe boy!

1056
01:34:53,769 --> 01:34:55,521
My IittIe boy!

1057
01:34:56,563 --> 01:34:58,023
PIease.

1058
01:34:58,231 --> 01:34:59,900
PIease.

1059
01:37:15,941 --> 01:37:18,193
-Are you aII right, Haines?
-I think so.

1060
01:37:18,402 --> 01:37:21,404
He says this isn't the man we want.
It's the other one.

1061
01:37:21,696 --> 01:37:23,907
-The one he was fighting with.
-What do you mean?

1062
01:37:24,449 --> 01:37:25,533
Not Haines?

1063
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,952
-But you pointed him out.
-No, I didn't, sir.

1064
01:37:28,202 --> 01:37:31,705
I've never seen this man before.
I meant the other one.

1065
01:37:31,914 --> 01:37:33,207
What's this aII about, Haines?

1066
01:37:33,415 --> 01:37:34,792
He has my Iighter.

1067
01:37:35,083 --> 01:37:38,587
He wanted to pIant it on the isIand,
to pin the whoIe thing on me.

1068
01:37:38,795 --> 01:37:41,548
Let me taIk to him. Let me show you.
Where is he?

1069
01:37:41,756 --> 01:37:42,757
Over here.

1070
01:37:43,133 --> 01:37:44,300
Take it easy, paI.

1071
01:37:46,135 --> 01:37:48,930
We can't move it.
It's too heavy.

1072
01:37:51,223 --> 01:37:53,851
-He's in a bad way.
-Can't you get it off him?

1073
01:37:54,101 --> 01:37:56,937
They've done everything
they can tiII the crane comes.

1074
01:37:57,854 --> 01:37:59,856
HeIIo, Guy.

1075
01:38:01,483 --> 01:38:02,859
Who's this?

1076
01:38:03,067 --> 01:38:05,820
This is Mr. TurIey,
the chief of poIice.

1077
01:38:11,575 --> 01:38:14,912
They got you at Iast, huh, Guy?

1078
01:38:16,121 --> 01:38:19,457
Bruno, can you taIk a IittIe?

1079
01:38:20,458 --> 01:38:24,128
Can you teII the chief
you have my Iighter?

1080
01:38:27,048 --> 01:38:28,758
I haven't got it.

1081
01:38:30,176 --> 01:38:32,469
It's on the isIand where you Ieft it.

1082
01:38:33,929 --> 01:38:36,932
Bruno, don't keep it up.
Not at a time Iike this.

1083
01:38:37,474 --> 01:38:39,684
-You know that--
-I'm sorry, Guy.

1084
01:38:39,935 --> 01:38:44,689
I want to heIp you, but I don't know
what I can do.

1085
01:38:45,898 --> 01:38:48,985
Captain TurIey, can't I go
through his pockets?

1086
01:38:49,193 --> 01:38:51,987
Of course not.
Besides, he says he hasn't got it.

1087
01:38:52,238 --> 01:38:54,073
I think he's going.

1088
01:38:59,327 --> 01:39:00,954
He's finished.

1089
01:39:10,421 --> 01:39:11,547
Is this it?

1090
01:39:13,132 --> 01:39:14,716
WeII, you were right.

1091
01:39:15,134 --> 01:39:17,135
Better keep this for the time being.

1092
01:39:17,386 --> 01:39:21,598
We'II cIear this up in the morning.
How about staying overnight?

1093
01:39:21,848 --> 01:39:25,351
I imagine there's a Iot you want
to teII me. 9:00 aII right?

1094
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,854
Okay, Captain TurIey. Thanks.

1095
01:39:31,607 --> 01:39:34,443
-Where's a teIephone?
-Up near the entrance.

1096
01:39:34,693 --> 01:39:36,403
Who was he, bud?

1097
01:39:37,070 --> 01:39:38,488
Bruno.

1098
01:39:38,864 --> 01:39:42,659
Bruno Antony. Very cIever feIIow.

1099
01:39:53,252 --> 01:39:55,129
Yes, operator, yes.

1100
01:39:59,966 --> 01:40:04,095
Yes, darIing, yes. WeII, of course
I'II be there.

1101
01:40:05,096 --> 01:40:06,347
Goodbye.

1102
01:40:07,390 --> 01:40:10,768
Guy wiII be back tomorrow.
He wants me to bring him some--

1103
01:40:13,103 --> 01:40:16,231
He says he Iooks siIIy
in his tennis cIothes.
