00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:35,056
Tommy?

3
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:38,915
Jesus!

4
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:46,044
What’re you doing here?

5
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:49,293
I was just passing through.

6
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,703
And I figured,
why not have a belt with the old man.

7
00:02:58,342 --> 00:02:59,793
She looks good.

8
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:01,198
Yeah,

9
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:03,506
she’s hanging in there.

10
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:07,175
Well, you always did take good care of her.

11
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,217
Paddy Conlon.

12
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:13,987
Man of priorities.

13
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:24,051
Got a little something for ya.

14
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:28,473
Mom always said,
never go anywhere empty handed.

15
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,474
She did.

16
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:32,869
But that’s not for me anymore, Tommy.

17
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:39,364
You change brands?

18
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:43,967
let’s go inside, huh.

19
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:47,129
Tommy...

20
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:50,064
C’mon, let’s go inside.

I like what you’ve done with the place.

24
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:17,834
-  Appreciate that.

25
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,081
- There’s not much of a woman’s touch around here.

26
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,640
- No more women for me, Tommy.

27
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:31,113
Yeah...

28
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:35,226
Must be hard to find a girl
who can take a punch nowadays.

29
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:43,600
- Here you go.

30
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:47,384
- Coffee?

31
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:52,701
You haven’t seen a guy in 14 years
and you’re not gonna have a drink with him?

32
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:54,988
- I told you, I’m off it. Tommy.

33
00:04:55,023 --> 00:04:57,356
I’m coming up on a thousand days.

34
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,997
- C’mon,
just a drink.

35
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:03,998
- No.

36
00:05:31,593 --> 00:05:33,291
He’s a school teacher down in Philly.

37
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:37,174
Remember Tess?

38
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,753
They’ve got two beautiful little girls.

39
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:09,395
So you found God, huh?
That’s awesome.

40
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,136
Mom kept calling for him,
but he wasn’t around.

41
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:19,227
I guess Jesus was down at the mill
forgiving all  the drunks. Huh?

42
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,082
Who knew?

43
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,068
So, you gonna ask about her,

44
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,594
or you just gonna sit there all sober?

45
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,643
I know.

46
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:39,089
Oh, you know?
What do you know?

47
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:43,732
Do you know it wasn’t enough just to
drive west to get away from you?

48
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:46,089
Once, we hit the water we drove north, too.

49
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:49,731
- When I got sober
I hired a man to find you.

50
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,677
- Is that one of the 12 steps?

51
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,744
Or does a guy like you get 24?

52
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,257
- Just the 12.

53
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:08,259
- Did your guy tell you
what you needed to know?

54
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:12,075
- Just that your mother died in Tacoma.

55
00:07:14,177 --> 00:07:15,634
And you were in the Marines.

56
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,298
That was all.
That was enough.

57
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:26,107
- Well, That’s too bad.

58
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:29,857
You could’ve gotten some good details.

59
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:38,081
You could’ve heard about her coughing up blood
on her kness,in a shit box with no heat.

60
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:42,226
Having me rub her down with holy water,

61
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,735
because she didn’t have no insurance.

62
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:50,342
All the time.. waiting for your pal Jesus to save her.

63
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:54,365
Did your man tell you that?

64
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:00,083
- I’m sorry, Tommy.

65
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:10,714
- Well, It’s good to know you’re sorry, Pop.

66
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,822
It goes a long way.

67
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:23,955
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

68
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:53,013
What’s going on over here?

69
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:58,106
Well, I’m not sure,
but I think Daddy is now a princess.

70
00:08:58,107 --> 00:09:00,510
- Daddy, you look so handsome.

71
00:09:00,545 --> 00:09:01,570
- Do I?

72
00:09:09,743 --> 00:09:10,984
You want to open your presents?

73
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,548
This an awfully big box.

74
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:36,037
It’s her birthday.

75
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:37,038
I know,

76
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,624
but that’s why you call it a budget.
You set it, and you don’t budge.

77
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,875
Hey babe, I’m late.

78
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,953
Mom’s saying goodbye to the girls.

79
00:09:56,988 --> 00:10:00,361
She’s gotta get on the road. They’ve been fed.
They just need a bath.

80
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:01,578
I’m on it.

81
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:03,864
Can you get them in bed
at a reasonable time tonight?

82
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,865
After the party,
They’re exhausted.

83
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:06,866
- Where's the rest of that skirt?

84
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:07,867
Babe.

85
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,385
Listen, if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight
you give me a call, okay?

86
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:16,145
- Yeah. Just like you gave me a call
when those Temple frat boys decided to smash up your face.

87
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:19,080
I told you, most nights
I sit on the stool and grade papers,

88
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:21,881
but every now and then
I need some action.

89
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:26,065
- Alright, well wait up for me tonight.
I’ll see what I can do about that.

90
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:28,895
- Promises, promises.

91

<i>JON ANIK (ON TV):

redefining Mixed Martial Arts here in the States? </i>

95
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:51,198
<i>- Well, Mixed Martial Arts is a sport that
I’ve always been incredibly passionate about.</i>

96
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:53,366
<i>As for where the idea for Sparta came from,</i>

97
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:56,363
<i>I’ve always kind of dug the Grand Prix format,</i>

98
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,364
<i> so I tracked these guys down to help me out. </i>

99

106
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:20,512
- Don’t know no Fitzy.

107
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:21,945
Colt Boyd owns this gym.

108
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:24,692
Can I help you with something?

109
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:28,537
- How’s it work?

110
00:11:29,864 --> 00:11:31,150
- Thirty five a month with locker.

111
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,598
We’re open at 7, lights out at 11.

112
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,206
- So, You wanna join?

113
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:38,909
- Sure.

114
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:42,618
- Put your name and contact info on the card.

115
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:47,115
- Thank you.

116
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,724
Whoa whoa whoa!
There’s a lesson in this too, OK?

117
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:04,213
So we have a body at rest,

118
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:06,585
and you have the bat which needs--

119
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:07,586
Acceleration.

120
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:08,587
Acceleration, okay.

121
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:09,588
If you have enough acceleration,

122
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:12,812
you might have a chance
to break the body at rest.

123
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:25,883
Alright, There we go.

124
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:33,798
Dial it down.

125
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:36,881
So, have we got it?

126
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,772
Force equals mass times acceleration.

127
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:39,716
We got it.

128
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,982
Alright. The third law--

129
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:47,114
How many laws this dude got?

130
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:48,319
- The dude?
- Yes, the dude.

131
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:50,634
The dude has three.

132
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:58,999
Newton the dude says that
for every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction.

133
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:01,234
For example,

134
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:05,505
if KC does not stop the action
of sending texts in class...

135
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,151
...and tell her posse outside to beat it...

136
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:11,583
...then my reaction might be to
send her down to Principal Zito’s office.

137
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:14,141
Thus setting our world back..

138
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:15,909
in proper balance.

139
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,910
Mr. C, I put it away.

140
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:20,361
Alright, before you go,

141
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:22,366
I have your tests from last week.

142
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,110
Where do you find these girls?

143
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,771
We got a tournament coming up. You
gonna kill every guy in the ‘Burgh?

144
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,881
Fenroy. Get me some ice.

145
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:08,787
And call that Puerto Rican kid, the one that
fights outa the Bottoms.

146
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:11,119
If he’s here in 20 minutes,
he gets 200 bucks.

147
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Yo, I’ll fight him.

148
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:14,496
Do me a favor guy,
go back to your bag.

149
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:16,346
We don’t need anybody else getting hurt.

150
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:17,466
Take a walk.

151
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,320
Yo Rock, What did you do?
Did you leave Mick and Paulie at home today?

152
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:30,728
His phone’s disconnected.

153
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:31,729
Then go through the list.
find me somebody.

154
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,730
Get me Joe Bones.

155
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:35,180
All I’m saying is...

156
00:14:35,215 --> 00:14:36,893
if you need somebody to help you,

157
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:39,581
I’m happy to keep your boy warm for you.

158
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:53,332
You ever fought before?

159
00:14:54,564 --> 00:14:55,982
Yeah.

160
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,787
This guy sign a waiver?

161
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:00,788
All good.

162
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,681
What’s your name?

163
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:07,597
Tommy.

164
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:10,284
You get tuned up in here, it’s on you, Tommy.

165
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,285
Sure, no problem.

166
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:15,129
Come on in.

167
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:29,174
Gonna be a hero? Alright.

168
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:29,159
You owe me two hundred bucks.

169
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,165
This one here.

170
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,455
See, this is the new appraisal figure,
as they came in.

171
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,498
As you can see, that's just the way it is,
that puts you upside down .

172
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:01,071
That’s the problem. It’s the country
that did the assessment, not the bank.

173
00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:04,338
So, the numbers are
what they are, Mr. Conlon.

174
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,339
- Brendan.

175
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,340
The numbers are what they are, Brendan.

176
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:08,456
I mean, you’re a Math teacher,
you can appreciate that.

177
00:17:08,457 --> 00:17:10,940
Physics teacher.
I teach Physics.

178
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:11,941
Physics. OK.

179
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:14,551
But the bank has got
to go by the new appraisal figures,

180
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:15,552
According to these figures,

181
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:17,502
you’re upside down on your mortgage--

182
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,503
You said that three times.

183
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,307
I get that.

184
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:23,365
But I’m asking you if
there’s something else you can do.

185
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:25,729
Not the bank, you.

186
00:17:25,764 --> 00:17:27,604
Can you shift things around, restructure--

187
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:29,582
- Well, you’ve already refinanced twice.
Already,

188
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,583
- Because you advised us to do that.

189
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:34,016
I presented you with that option.

190
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:35,488
That was your choice.

191
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:39,695
I’m also showing you netted a
substantial payout with the refi.

192
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:42,031
- We had that conversation.

193
00:17:43,735 --> 00:17:47,206
I was paying medical bills.
Is that in your file?

194
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:50,138
Oh, right. Sorry.
Your daughter’s...kidney?

195
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:51,139
- Heart.

196
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,904
- Heart, right.
Sorry.

197
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,905
Lot of stories.

198
00:17:57,145 --> 00:18:00,959
So my option is I’ve got no options?
You’re not even gonna try to help me?

199
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
- I am trying..

200
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:04,869
Look, I can get you 90 days to get even--

201
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,870
- 90 days is not enough.

202
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,000
My wife and I have three jobs between us;

203
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,727
and that doesn’t cut it.

204
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:15,997
So, what do you suggest?

205
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:18,408
Let me ask you a question:

206
00:18:18,443 --> 00:18:19,842
Have you thought aboutbankruptcy?

207
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:22,215
It’s a viable option.

208
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:24,898
There’s no shame in it these days.

209
00:18:30,387 --> 00:18:31,592
- That’s not how I do things.

210
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,399
- Well, then you’re looking at foreclosure.

211
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:50,299
<i> TV- ANNOUNCER #1: Utter domination by Tommy Conlon,

215
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:58,413
<i>- The controversial Paddy Conlon. </i>

216
00:18:58,414 --> 00:19:01,618
<i>Say what you will about the methods
of the former Marine, </i>

217
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:04,266
<i>but he’s led  his son

218
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:07,351

219
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:09,798

Wow! </i>

220
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,734
<i>There’s just no limit to what the
future holds for this kid! </i>

221
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,550
<i>Tommy told me that he’s chasing
the record of Theogenes,</i>

222
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:16,551
<i>apparently a mythical Greek fighter,</i>

<i>said to be unbeaten in over 1400 bouts... </i>

224
00:19:22,233 --> 00:19:23,184
How you doin,’ sir?

225
00:19:23,185 --> 00:19:24,185
I’m looking for Tommy Riordan.

226
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:25,186
- Who?

227
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:28,303
- Tommy Riordan?
My name’s Colt Boyd.

228
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:32,709
- What business you got with Tommy?

229
00:19:32,744 --> 00:19:33,949
- None yet.

230
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:36,102
That’s why I’m here. I manage fighters.

231
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:40,590
Tommy’s been working out at my gym.

232
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:46,471
He put a beating on the number one
middleweight contender in the world today.

233
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:50,236
I want to know more about the guy.

234
00:19:50,237 --> 00:19:51,237
Maybe help him out.

235
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:54,697
I have a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.

236
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:57,897
- Conlon. Name’s Conlon.

237
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:02,941
And anything you want to know about Tommy,
you gotta ask him yourself.

238
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:05,609
- Look, I’m just asking for
some general information here.

239
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,066
- Like I said,
anything you want to know about Tommy,

240
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:09,067
you gotta ask him yourself.

241
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:11,360
- Look, I don’t mean to interrupt your night. Okay?

242
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:13,567
He just put this address down
when he signed up at the gym.

243
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:14,568
- He doesn’t live here.

244
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:18,648
- Alright then.

245
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:19,976
- Goodnight.

246
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:31,244
Listen kiddo,
I need you put Mommy back on, OK?

247
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:33,554
I love you.

248
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:36,517
Hey, listen...I’m just pulling in.
I'm gonna have to go.

249
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:42,664
Huh? Oh, they’ve got this open mic night thing.

250
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:43,665
It's gonna be a quiet one.

251
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,242
Sleep well.

252
00:20:48,211 --> 00:20:49,422
You too. Bye.

253

<i>are you ready?</i>

269
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:01,349
<i>Let's do it!</i>

270
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,134
How was work?

271
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,770
Oh my God.

272
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,580
What happened?

273
00:24:31,255 --> 00:24:32,555
You said it was going to be a slow night.

274
00:24:36,428 --> 00:24:37,830
I’m not bouncing at a club.

275
00:24:41,402 --> 00:24:42,913
What do you mean you’re not bouncing?

276
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:03,793
You’ve been lying to me?

277
00:25:07,895 --> 00:25:08,934
I went in to apply.

278
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,019
They were only paying nine bucks an hour.

279
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:24,556
Then I saw a sign for this other thing.

280
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:33,711
They’re putting us out of the house in three months,
we’re running out of options--

281
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:36,652
Then they’ll put us out of the house in three months.

282
00:25:36,653 --> 00:25:40,238
I’d rather go back to the old apartment than
see you in the back of an ambulance again.

283
00:25:42,383 --> 00:25:44,780
I thought we agreed that
we weren’t going to raise our children in

284
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:48,526
a family where
their father gets beat up for a living.

285
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:53,578
We’re not giving up the house.

286
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:56,076
This is our home.

287
00:25:58,085 --> 00:25:59,274
We’re not going backwards.

288
00:26:13,002 --> 00:26:14,302
We’ll figure it out.

289
00:26:17,004 --> 00:26:18,830
But this is what we’re not going back to.

290
00:27:17,627 --> 00:27:18,954
You wanted to talk?

291
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:22,189
- Yeah.

292
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:26,297
I’m gonna start fighting.

293
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:28,875
- Is that right?

294
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,865
- Don’t play babe in the woods with me.
I know that guy from the gym came to see you.

295
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:34,849
- Colt Boyd? yeah..

296
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,256
I didn’t tell him anything, Tommy.

297
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:39,834
We wouldn’t be sitting
here now if you did.

298
00:27:39,835 --> 00:27:42,912
Waiter: Paddy, can I get you more coffee?
- No, thank you.

299
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:50,073
Alright. Look.

300
00:27:50,074 --> 00:27:51,074
There’s this tournament.

301
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,279
It's a big tournament.

302
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,904
Top sixteen middleweights in the world.

303
00:27:56,905 --> 00:27:57,905
Single elimination.

304
00:27:57,906 --> 00:28:01,377
Winner take all for a lot of money.

305
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:05,069
I’m gonna do that.

306
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:08,745
But if I’m doin’ it,

307
00:28:08,746 --> 00:28:13,563
then I’m gonna need a trainer.

308
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:17,313
Now that much you were good at.

309
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:22,520
No, no, no.

310
00:28:22,555 --> 00:28:24,066
This doesn’t mean anything..okay?

311
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:25,067
I’m serious.

312
00:28:26,848 --> 00:28:28,656
We train. That’s it.

313
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:31,389
I don’t wanna hear
a word about anything but training,

314
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,390
...you understand?

315
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:34,849
You wanna tell your war stories,

316
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,850
you can take ‘em down to the VFW.

317
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:38,611
You can take ‘em to a meeting,

318
00:28:38,646 --> 00:28:42,178
or church, or wherever
the hell it is you go nowadays.

319
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,684
- What about Colt Boyd?

320
00:28:44,685 --> 00:28:46,957
- What about him? I told him
I don’t train with people I don’t know.

321
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,851
- Ah, the devil you know.
- Excuse me?

322
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:53,290
- The devil you know is better than
the devil you don’t.

323
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:58,074
- Yeah.

324
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:07,169
Chasing Theogenes.
It’ll be kinda like old times.

325
00:29:08,153 --> 00:29:10,478
- I just told you,
this doesn’t mean anything.

326
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:14,730
Now, get that through your skull
right now or I’m walking.

327
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:15,731
Alright. Alright.

328
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:19,517
But you get something through your skull, too.

329
00:29:19,518 --> 00:29:20,518
You called me.

330
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:23,890
So don’t go threatening
to walk every five minutes!

331
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:27,627
And since this is about training,

332
00:29:27,628 --> 00:29:31,995
you dump whatever it is you need to dump
as far as those  pills are concerned.

333
00:29:31,996 --> 00:29:32,996
I don’t want to see ‘em.

334
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:36,579
In fact, hand ‘em over right now.

335
00:29:39,768 --> 00:29:41,216
I know they’re on you, Tommy.

336
00:29:41,217 --> 00:29:44,514
You sounded like a goddamn maraca
coming through the door.

337
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,109
That’s not gonna do.

338
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:02,426
When you came through that door

339
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,200
it was chhh-chhh-chhh.

340
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:08,677
Three.

341
00:30:18,094 --> 00:30:20,832
And another thing,
you don’t eat crap like this.

342
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:22,892
This is for losers and old men.

343
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:26,586
And we’re gonna have to bunk up.

344
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:29,262
If we’re gonna do this right,
you gotta stay at the house.

345
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:32,605
I watch your diet,
we follow the old regimen.

346
00:30:34,456 --> 00:30:35,578
You copy?

347
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:41,931
Copy.

348
00:30:57,892 --> 00:31:02,592
My brother said in the middle of night,
he was at the strip  club and saw Mr. C ...

349
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,182
You weren't there, you don't know.

350
00:31:05,217 --> 00:31:06,455
What’s MMA?

351
00:31:06,456 --> 00:31:07,456
Mixed Martial Arts.

352
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:09,351
Like, different styles of fighting.

353
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:18,937
Take your seats.

354
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:21,096
Now, please.

355
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:33,609
- Yo, Mr. C.
- uh Huh?

356
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:38,795
My brother was at the titty bar last night
and he said you was choking brothers out.

357
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:39,796
What’s up? Is it true?

358
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:44,576
Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, did you really
work on some fools or something?

359
00:31:44,577 --> 00:31:45,577
You have to tell us.

360
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:46,578
- Yeah.

361
00:31:57,795 --> 00:32:00,550
I want examples of 'forms of energy'.

362
00:32:21,445 --> 00:32:22,785
C’mon, it’s not as bad as it looks.

363
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:25,725
- Are you being literal or figurative?

364
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:27,951
Because literally it looks bad.

365
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:30,797
And figuratively it looks even worse.

366
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:34,382
The superintendent’s coming by in a few minutes.

367
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:38,282
- Oh, Man!

368
00:32:38,283 --> 00:32:39,283
- So, c'mon Brandon.

369
00:32:39,284 --> 00:32:41,657
gimme a little help here.

370
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:45,534
Could you explain to me
what the hell you were doing?

371
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,157
- I need the money, Joe.

372
00:32:52,158 --> 00:32:53,158
- Yeah, but this is...

373
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:56,656
We can’t have this!

374
00:32:56,657 --> 00:32:59,568
This isn’t moonlighting at Applebee’s
for Christ’s sake.

375
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:02,246
Shit, Brendan.

376
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,492
Leaving everything else aside,
which we can’t,

377
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:07,530
are you out of your mind?

378
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:09,517
You’re gonna get yourself killed.

379
00:33:10,528 --> 00:33:12,242
I mean, you’re..
you’re a goddamn teacher.

380
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:14,436
You’ve got no business
in the ring with those animals.

381
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,250
- Actually, I used to be one of those animals.

382
00:33:22,306 --> 00:33:23,352
I fought for a living.

383
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,944
Guess I forgot to put that
down on my application.

384
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:31,616
- Yeah, I guess you did.

385
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:34,940
- Look, I’m sorry, Joe. It’s just--

386
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:40,520
- Look, look...the school district’s not going to
tolerate school teachers cockfighting in strip clubs.

387
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:43,373
- It was the parking lot of a strip club.

388
00:33:43,374 --> 00:33:46,186
- Wherever it was,
you can’t be doing it, alright?

389
00:33:46,707 --> 00:33:47,788
I mean this is a serious--

390
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:48,789
shit, he’s here.

391
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:52,000
This is a serious problem.

392
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:59,829
The guy hasn’t been inside a school since 9-11.

393
00:34:03,035 --> 00:34:04,022
- What are we gonna do?

394
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:09,056
- You say yes, sir.
And you say no, sir.

395
00:34:09,057 --> 00:34:11,770
And you say it’ll never happen again, sir.

396
00:34:13,048 --> 00:34:16,262
And then we just
pray to God he’s in a good mood.

397
00:34:22,885 --> 00:34:25,112
- UFC?

398
00:34:25,113 --> 00:34:26,113
- Yeah.

399
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:30,005
- Sonofabitch.

400
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,008
What are you doing?

401
00:34:59,112 --> 00:35:02,562
- The girls have an important
piano recital in the morning.

402
00:35:04,094 --> 00:35:05,737
Got an equipment malfunction.

403
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:11,632
How’d it go?

404
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:15,597
- They’re gonna review your case
at the end of the semester,

405
00:35:17,445 --> 00:35:20,095
but until then
you’re suspended without pay.

406
00:35:28,511 --> 00:35:30,529
Joe gave me the number of his attorney.

407
00:35:32,893 --> 00:35:34,623
- How the hell are we gonna
pay for an attorney?

408
00:35:34,624 --> 00:35:37,063
- He talked to me for free.
As a favor to Joe.

409
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:39,332
- That's nice.

410
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:42,202
- He said there’s no precedent for this.

411
00:35:42,203 --> 00:35:44,699
You’ll be back by next semester.

412
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
- Next semester?

413
00:35:57,977 --> 00:35:59,345
Look, Tess.

414
00:36:00,851 --> 00:36:02,717
They have these smoker fights all over.

415
00:36:05,057 --> 00:36:06,675
There’s one in Lancaster next week.

416
00:36:06,676 --> 00:36:08,929
There’s two in Dover the week after.

417
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:10,615
Wilmington.

418
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,250
Camden. Baltimore.

419
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:18,051
It could keep us afloat.

420
00:36:20,197 --> 00:36:22,714
- You’re gonna put yourself through this
over and over,

421
00:36:22,715 --> 00:36:24,700
for five hundred bucks a pop?

422
00:36:27,627 --> 00:36:29,141
- Some of them pay a little more than that.

423
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:36,798
I would have had to bounce for a month
to make what I made in two hours last night.

424
00:36:42,506 --> 00:36:44,127
And these guys,
they’re not real fighters.

425
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:48,932
They’re just guys
who have seen too much UFC on TV.

426
00:36:56,096 --> 00:36:57,473
If you have a better solution,

427
00:36:59,442 --> 00:37:00,749
I’m all ears.

428
00:37:04,543 --> 00:37:06,276
- What are we gonna tell the girls?

429
00:37:08,065 --> 00:37:09,227
- It’ll be fine.

430
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:11,849
I’ll just leave the house as usual,

431
00:37:12,894 --> 00:37:15,055
except only this time,
I’ll be going to the gym.

432
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,058
<i>Oh the duck goes quack - quack quack..</i>

433
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:36,040
<i>and the cow says moo, moo..mooooo!</i>

434
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:41,712
<i>But that rooster,
the old red rooster he knew everything...</i>

435
00:37:43,985 --> 00:37:46,528
<i>cock-a-doodle-doo. Cock-a- doodle-doo. </i>

436
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:48,447
Let's go kiddo.

437
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,421
Let's get moving.

438
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,698
Look what I found..

439
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:59,409
in that disaster of a basement.

440
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:06,802
What do 'ya say we sit down
and update this?

441
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:13,160
And you can fill me in on;
how close you got to that record.

442
00:38:16,523 --> 00:38:20,587
Did you continue wrestling,
after you left with your mother?

443
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:27,622
C’mon, Tommy.
Tell me something.

444
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:31,483
- Yeah, I’ll tell ya something.

445
00:38:33,486 --> 00:38:35,505
You can take that back to where you found it.

446
00:38:36,668 --> 00:38:38,252
And you can leave
the coffee in the pot.

447
00:38:39,155 --> 00:38:40,751
I can pour that myself.

448
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,792
And  I can wake myself up, too.

449
00:38:55,153 --> 00:38:56,008
- OK.

450
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:59,358
Hurt my knees coming up and down
those stairs anyhow.

451
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,417
I'll leave the coffee pot’s on til 0-500,
then I dump it.

452
00:39:04,418 --> 00:39:05,418
Damn dude, that’s brutal.

453
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,993
I give command to dismiss.

454
00:39:12,994 --> 00:39:14,987
You'll wash your nasty bodies.

455
00:39:16,384 --> 00:39:17,582
and square your gear away.

456
00:39:36,154 --> 00:39:38,056
Damn dude, that’s brutal.

457
00:39:39,956 --> 00:39:40,868
- What’s that?

458
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:44,553
Dude, “Mad Dog” Grimes gettin’ tuned up
by some dude in a gym in Pittsburgh.

459
00:39:44,554 --> 00:39:45,554
- Who’s “Mad Dog” Grimes?

460
00:39:45,555 --> 00:39:48,722
- Shit, Bradford.
The stuff you don’t know amazes me.

461
00:39:50,075 --> 00:39:51,043
Oh my god, did you see that?

462
00:39:51,044 --> 00:39:52,044
- Wait, rewind that.

463
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,234
Right there...
pause, pause..pause.

464
00:40:02,431 --> 00:40:03,513
What's up man?

465
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:07,797
Dude, what's his deal?

466
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:17,032
AV, I need to see the tape!

467
00:40:17,033 --> 00:40:18,033
- What tape?

468
00:40:19,194 --> 00:40:20,533
- The tape.

469
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:26,916
Get the camera.

470
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,555
That’s him.

471
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,324
That’s him.

472
00:41:10,498 --> 00:41:11,799
Frank: Let the music sink in to you.

473
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
This is Beethoven.

474
00:41:12,801 --> 00:41:13,801
And I want you to breathe.

475
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:14,802
I don't want you boxing like this.

476
00:41:14,803 --> 00:41:16,830
No more stiffs...right?

477
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,270
You listen to the music.

478
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:19,432
You relax...you breathe.

479
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:49,743
Do I know you?

480
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:53,244
Long time, brother.

481
00:41:55,745 --> 00:41:56,561
- I'm liking the place.

482
00:41:58,167 --> 00:41:59,136
- You see this beast?

483
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,563
Marco Santos?
I’m training him for Sparta.

484
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:03,564
- Oh Yeah, right.

485
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:04,565
- Not bad, right?

486
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:05,566
- It's amazing man.

487
00:42:12,214 --> 00:42:13,123
You look good, brother.

488
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:14,182
- Thanks.

489
00:42:18,796 --> 00:42:20,038
-  How’re the girls?

490
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:23,723
- Good.
I had another little one. Rosie.

491
00:42:23,724 --> 00:42:27,783
- I know. Because, Johnny C. told me
she was in the hospital for a bit.

492
00:42:30,622 --> 00:42:31,803
You know I uh..

493
00:42:34,924 --> 00:42:36,593
I was gonna call you and then time went by.

494
00:42:36,594 --> 00:42:39,229
I’m a piece of shit.
I should have called you, I'm sorry.

495
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:43,363
No, Brendan. I’m sorry.

496
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:46,649
- It’s all good.
She’s good now.

497
00:42:52,854 --> 00:42:54,064
- It’s good to see you, man.

498
00:42:54,065 --> 00:42:57,863
So everything’s going...
It's great huh?

499
00:43:00,434 --> 00:43:03,635
- Yeah. Well, I’ve got a little problem.

500
00:43:06,406 --> 00:43:08,806
The guys at the bank
want to take my house away.

501
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:09,807
- Wow.
- Yeah.

502
00:43:11,407 --> 00:43:13,126
That’s kind of why I came to see you, actually.

503
00:43:18,798 --> 00:43:21,848
- I’ve got most of my dough tied up
in this joint, but..

504
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:22,849
how much do you need?

505
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,444
- I didn’t come here for a loan, Frank.

506
00:43:25,445 --> 00:43:26,445
I mean...

507
00:43:26,446 --> 00:43:31,359
I was hoping you’d train me.

508
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,257
- Train you for what?

509
00:43:35,153 --> 00:43:36,607
- I want to get back in the cage.

510
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:39,618
- Are you serious?

511
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,678
Come on, Brandon.

512
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:45,604
- I just won an event the other night.

513
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:48,556
- Ah, you won an event.
That’s what this is.

514
00:43:50,245 --> 00:43:51,632
Let me guess,
it was in a parking lot.

515
00:43:51,633 --> 00:43:54,842
DJ from the local radio station.
Couple of ring card girls...

516
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:55,843
you wouldn’t bang on a dare.

517
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:56,844
Am I right?

518
00:43:59,107 --> 00:44:00,506
- Ish.
-  Ish...

519
00:44:01,741 --> 00:44:03,530
Brendan. I love you.

520
00:44:05,162 --> 00:44:06,409
Why would I train you?

521
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:11,819
When you were in shape and on the right side
of 30 you were barely a .500 fighter. You never listened to me.

522
00:44:13,628 --> 00:44:15,123
You never listened to anyone.

523
00:44:15,124 --> 00:44:16,124
These guys are animals.

524
00:44:19,143 --> 00:44:20,585
You’re a teacher, right?

525
00:44:21,852 --> 00:44:24,660
What’re you gonna do? You’re gonna come down
here for a couple days a week after detention?

526
00:44:25,923 --> 00:44:28,185
You’re gonna skip out of the girl’s
volleyball game early?

527
00:44:30,038 --> 00:44:31,312
- I’ve got loads of time.

528
00:44:31,313 --> 00:44:32,313
Time’s not an issue.

529
00:44:33,509 --> 00:44:35,357
The parking lot thing
kinda got me suspended.

530
00:44:43,983 --> 00:44:45,518
I need to keep working the smokers.

531
00:44:50,193 --> 00:44:51,252
- Tess know about this?
- Mmm..hmm.

532
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:57,574
- ‘Cause the last time you  fought, I got read the riot act
sitting in a hospital waiting room. You remember that?

533
00:44:58,752 --> 00:44:59,867
- I was unconscious.

534
00:44:59,868 --> 00:45:02,342
- You were more than unconcious.

535
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:08,184
She’s not gonna come down here with
the two puppies, screaming at Frank?

536
00:45:09,302 --> 00:45:10,475
- It’s not gonna happen.

537
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:14,055
What do you say, Frank?

538
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:17,956
- What do I say?
What am I gonna say to you? No?

539
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,063
I mean,
all my time is wrapped up with Marco.

540
00:45:21,064 --> 00:45:22,064
You come down,
I’ll throw you in the rotation,

541
00:45:22,065 --> 00:45:24,068
you spar with these guys,

542
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:27,535
But I can’t promise you
much more than that, Brendan.

543
00:45:29,036 --> 00:45:30,212
- That’s all I need.

544
00:45:34,449 --> 00:45:35,344
I appreciate it.

545
00:45:39,052 --> 00:45:40,134
- Let me know when you’re coming down.

546
00:45:40,135 --> 00:45:42,223
Well, I’m just gonna go
get my stuff from the car.

547
00:45:44,197 --> 00:45:45,501
- Now?

548
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:14,395
Hey, Brendan.

549
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,396
It’s me, Pop.

550
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:22,882
What’re you doing here?

551
00:46:23,975 --> 00:46:25,435
- I have some news for you.

552
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:30,527
- Something wrong with your hands?

553
00:46:32,344 --> 00:46:34,566
If there’s nothing wrong with your hands
then there’s no reason for you not to phone.

554
00:46:35,395 --> 00:46:36,282
- That’s the deal.
- I forgot.

555
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:39,307
- Phone or mail, Pop.
Non negotiable.

556
00:46:39,308 --> 00:46:40,308
- Hey Brendan,

557
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:43,039
Have you ever seen my hands so steady?

558
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,040
Ever seen them?

559
00:46:47,348 --> 00:46:48,188
- I’m going inside.

560
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,190
- I’ve got a thousand days, Brendan.

561
00:46:52,373 --> 00:46:54,042
A thousand days sober today.

562
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:57,173
- Well, that’s great, Pop.
But it doesn’t change anything.

563
00:46:57,208 --> 00:47:00,323
- What do you mean it doesn’t change anything?
Have a heart, Brendan.

564
00:47:00,324 --> 00:47:01,324
- You listen to me.

565
00:47:03,545 --> 00:47:06,065
You take your have-a-heart bullshit
and you run it down the road.

566
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,696
Run it out on someone
who doesn’t know you like I do.

567
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:14,072
- I thought maybe we could break bread.

568
00:47:15,927 --> 00:47:17,777
Open some lines of communication.

569
00:47:17,778 --> 00:47:18,778
- You got two lines of communication,

570
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:21,816
You got the telephone and the post office.

571
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:25,382
Just because you decide it’s a special day,
it doesn’t make it one for me.

572
00:47:25,383 --> 00:47:26,383
I got a wife and kids inside

573
00:47:26,384 --> 00:47:29,312
and they’re waiting for me,
so I don’t have time for whatever this is.

574
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:30,313
-  I know you got a wife and kids in there.

575
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:33,558
I got a grand-daughter in there..

576
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:37,024
and I haven’t seen in three years
and another I haven’t even ever met.

577
00:47:37,025 --> 00:47:38,025
- Yeah, Why is that, Pop?

578
00:47:40,135 --> 00:47:41,322
Why is that?

579
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:45,282
Do you remember having anything to do with that?

580
00:47:45,283 --> 00:47:46,283
- Yeah.

581
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:50,550
- That shit you pulled.

582
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,074
Never again.

583
00:47:55,944 --> 00:47:57,440
And all the shit I saw growing up?

584
00:47:59,203 --> 00:48:00,791
That doesn’t happen here.

585
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,740
Take care of yourself.

586
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:08,710
- Tommy’s back.

587
00:48:15,297 --> 00:48:16,739
He’s in the ‘Burgh.

588
00:48:21,704 --> 00:48:23,059
- You say, Tommy’s in Pittsburgh?

589
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,060
- He came to see me.

590
00:48:27,454 --> 00:48:28,637
- He came to see you?

591
00:48:31,093 --> 00:48:32,334
- He’s over at the house.

592
00:48:33,454 --> 00:48:37,550
We’re doing a little training at Fitzy’s.

593
00:48:37,551 --> 00:48:38,551
Remember Fitzy’s?

594
00:48:38,552 --> 00:48:41,518
It ain’t Fitzy’s anymore.

595
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:45,730
- You and Tommy are training together?

596
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:48,908
Tommy Conlon?

597
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:49,909
- Riordan.

598
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:52,086
He’s using your mother’s maiden name now.

599
00:48:52,087 --> 00:48:53,087
I know what her name is.

600
00:48:53,088 --> 00:48:57,594
- I thought you’d want to know he’s back.
That’s why I drove all the way over here.

601
00:48:57,595 --> 00:49:00,518
- I thought you came
to break bread over a thousand days?

602
00:49:01,725 --> 00:49:03,980
That too.

603
00:49:08,269 --> 00:49:09,908
- Did he say if he wants to see me?

604
00:49:11,872 --> 00:49:13,229
- He doesn’t say much.

605
00:49:19,321 --> 00:49:21,262
He’s just not that happy kid he was.

606
00:49:24,187 --> 00:49:25,298
- Wow, look at you.

607
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:26,299
Mister inside man.

608
00:49:29,335 --> 00:49:31,527
You and Tommy training together
like nothing ever happened.

609
00:49:31,562 --> 00:49:32,856
This is unbelievable.

610
00:49:33,616 --> 00:49:34,930
- Now I know what you’re really doing here.
- What’s that?

611
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:35,931
- You came to gloat.

612
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:38,902
- I did not come to gloat.
I came to get my son back.

613
00:49:38,903 --> 00:49:39,903
- Well, there you go.

614
00:49:39,904 --> 00:49:40,904
Hey, You got your son back.

615
00:49:40,905 --> 00:49:41,905
- I’m talking about you, Bren--

616
00:49:41,906 --> 00:49:42,906
- You got your son back.

617
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,414
You know,

618
00:49:53,139 --> 00:49:54,177
Forget it!

619
00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:00,067
I'll tell you, part of the reason
I stuck around was...

620
00:50:00,068 --> 00:50:03,152
‘cause I thought I’d finally get you all to myself.

621
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,233
But you didn’t have any interest in training me.

622
00:50:09,234 --> 00:50:10,234
Tommy was the one.

623
00:50:10,235 --> 00:50:12,566
- Ah, Brendan.
I was a drunk.

624
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:13,567
I mean, you know.

625
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:16,673
I’m sorry.

626
00:50:18,446 --> 00:50:19,718
You were always a front runner.

627
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,648
You never had any interest in underdogs.

628
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,418
But I was your son.

629
00:50:26,419 --> 00:50:27,419
- You are my son, Brendan.

630
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,420
- Am I?

631
00:50:28,421 --> 00:50:29,421
- Yeah, you are.

632
00:50:31,982 --> 00:50:35,374
I’m just asking you to find...

633
00:50:37,506 --> 00:50:40,726
a whoo bit of space in your heart to forgive me.

634
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:48,439
- Yeah. Alright.
I forgive you.

635
00:50:51,155 --> 00:50:52,665
But I do not trust you.

636
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:58,391
So, tell Tommy...if he wants to see me,
this is where I am.

637
00:51:00,532 --> 00:51:02,130
- But they’re not different things.

638
00:51:02,131 --> 00:51:03,131
You’ve gotta trust to forgive--

639
00:51:04,286 --> 00:51:05,473
- Goodnight, Pop.

640
00:51:05,474 --> 00:51:09,083
My God, is that Emily?

641
00:51:09,084 --> 00:51:12,902
She’s grown, Brendan.
Is that Rosie?

642
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:13,903
- Daddy, who is that?

643
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,719
- Just some nice old man.

<i>Mad Dog, what is your response
to all the hoopla surrounding the video and Tommy Riordan? </i>

699
00:56:23,799 --> 00:56:24,799
- This guy’s a nobody.

700
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,800
It was just a sparring session.

701
00:56:25,801 --> 00:56:29,005
It is what it is,
and he’s gonna pay for it next month

702
00:56:29,006 --> 00:56:30,006

703

Frank: You’ve gotta relax
and stay calm in there.

709
00:57:12,286 --> 00:57:14,001
The cage is your home.

710
00:57:14,856 --> 00:57:15,995
You set the pace.

711
00:57:15,996 --> 00:57:16,996
You set the rhythm.

712
00:57:18,128 --> 00:57:19,771
Feel the Beethoven.

713
00:57:19,772 --> 00:57:20,772
Be smarter than him.

714
00:57:20,773 --> 00:57:23,792
More patient.
Wait for him to make a mistake.

715
00:57:23,793 --> 00:57:26,922
And when he does,
that’s your moment.

716
00:57:30,466 --> 00:57:32,009
No he did not tap you!

717
00:57:33,076 --> 00:57:34,186
Physics teacher!

718
00:57:34,187 --> 00:57:36,269
That’s the best in the world there, son.

719
00:58:52,801 --> 00:58:53,739
Coach!

720
00:58:58,185 --> 00:58:59,399
Hey,

721
00:58:59,434 --> 00:59:01,323
I know this isn’t a great time.

722
00:59:02,377 --> 00:59:04,280
And it’s too bad about Marco.

723
00:59:08,293 --> 00:59:09,696
But how about me?

724
00:59:11,626 --> 00:59:12,907
- You talking about Sparta?

725
00:59:15,132 --> 00:59:17,113
Brendan, You got a better chance
of starting a boy band.I’ll talk to you tomorrow.

726
00:59:27,988 --> 00:59:29,417
-  It’s a grand prix tournament.

727
00:59:32,028 --> 00:59:34,185
Which means anything can happen.
You know that as well as I do.

728
00:59:34,186 --> 00:59:35,186
- Yeah.

729
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,099
- They’ll have to kill me
to get me out of that cage.

730
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,260
- That’s what I’m afraid of.

731
00:59:42,295 --> 00:59:44,249
- Frank, I need this.

732
00:59:45,405 --> 00:59:46,820
You’re real tight with those guys.

733
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,974
You call them,
you're the guy they trust you.

734
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:56,746
- Brendan,

735
00:59:58,566 --> 01:00:00,083
You realize what you’re asking me to do here?

736
01:00:02,275 --> 01:00:04,428
We go down to AC
and you get tapped out in five seconds,

737
01:00:04,429 --> 01:00:06,851
how does that benefit  either one of us?

738
01:00:06,852 --> 01:00:07,852
- That’s not gonna happen.

739
01:00:07,853 --> 01:00:08,853
- Not gonna happen.

740
01:00:10,756 --> 01:00:12,385
Wish I had a  nickel for every time I heard that.

741
01:00:12,386 --> 01:00:13,386
<i>- It’s not gonna happen.</i>

742
01:00:30,184 --> 01:00:31,286
- I’ll make a call.

743
01:00:39,113 --> 01:00:40,662
- I love my coach!!!

744
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:52,026
Tess: Yeah, the girls are good.

745
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:53,027
They’re good.

746
01:00:54,919 --> 01:00:58,559
Yeah, you should. You’ve been spending
so much time with Brendan these days..

747
01:00:58,594 --> 01:01:01,086
it’s like you’re part of the family or something.

748
01:01:03,877 --> 01:01:04,984
Yeah, he’s right here.

749
01:01:04,985 --> 01:01:05,985
It’s your boyfriend.

750
01:01:08,937 --> 01:01:10,890
- Frank... Hey Man.

751
01:01:17,942 --> 01:01:19,068
That’s unbelievable.

752
01:01:22,186 --> 01:01:24,758
Frank, I can’t thank you enough.
I don’t know what to say.

753
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,490
Alright, listen,
I’ve gotta call you back. Okay.

754
01:01:35,794 --> 01:01:36,768
Alright, bye.

755
01:01:39,475 --> 01:01:42,542
I’m in. I’m going.

756
01:01:42,543 --> 01:01:43,543
- Really?

757
01:01:45,551 --> 01:01:48,020
So that’s your decision?
You decided?

758
01:01:51,035 --> 01:01:54,563
‘Cause I really enjoyed that conversation
we just had about making that decision together.

759
01:02:00,213 --> 01:02:03,351
You told me you were gonna fight
guys that watched too much UFC.

760
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,537
I saw that Koba dude on television,
and he’s the guy they’re watching.

761
01:02:08,538 --> 01:02:10,197
-  It’s a lot of money, Tess.

762
01:02:10,232 --> 01:02:11,867
- I don’t give a shit about the money, Brendan.
I told you that.

763
01:02:13,881 --> 01:02:17,432
We’re gonna end up cashing in your life insurance
policy before we pick up that prize money.

764
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:19,914
- You don’t think I can do it. Right?

765
01:02:20,789 --> 01:02:22,353
- I think you can get killed.

766
01:02:26,894 --> 01:02:27,819
- I’m not gonna get killed.

767
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:30,027
- you’re not going to get killed.
you promise me you’re not going to get hurt?

768
01:02:30,028 --> 01:02:32,605
You’re not gonna end up in the hospital?
You’re not gonna end up paralyzed?

769
01:02:32,606 --> 01:02:35,287
We’ll have no prize money.
We'll have no house.

770
01:02:35,288 --> 01:02:38,530
Payments for hospital bills--
- Listen, I promise you this:

771
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,516
if I don’t try in three weeks,
they’re gonna take the house.

772
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,799
How’s that for a promise?

773
01:02:50,751 --> 01:02:52,189
So, I’m gonna go, OK?

774
01:02:53,662 --> 01:02:55,653
But I’d really love it
if you’d be with me on this.

775
01:03:04,004 --> 01:03:05,693
- I’m not gonna watch you fight again.
I’m not.

776
01:03:05,694 --> 01:03:08,146
I’m gonna get the girls breakfast.

Tell us, why is this tournament
is so important to you?

783
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:10,023
- Growing up, we all wanted to know
who the toughest kid in the neighborhood was, right?

784
01:04:10,024 --> 01:04:12,634
I wanna  know
who the toughest man on the planet is.

Of course you don’t know them.

842
01:09:57,923 --> 01:09:59,892
- Why am I looking at pictures
of people I don’t know?

843
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:03,987
- Because that’s my family.

844
01:10:06,794 --> 01:10:08,359
- And who are you exactly?

845
01:10:13,795 --> 01:10:15,057

What?

848
01:10:21,814 --> 01:10:23,599

- I wasn’t in the Corps.

850

My brother was in the Corps.

852
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:31,961
- Jesus, Tommy.

853
01:10:33,264 --> 01:10:36,485
I was a 16 year old kid.
What the hell did I know?

854
01:10:36,486 --> 01:10:40,084
- I don’t know what you know.
Why don’t you go ask your girlfriend about it?

Nothing?

859
01:10:49,072 --> 01:10:51,172
God, man,
I don’t understand this.

860
01:10:53,588 --> 01:10:57,301
So, you won’t forgive me,
but you forgave Pop?

861
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,006
- He’s just some old vet I train with.

862
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:03,007
He means nothing to me.

863
01:11:05,585 --> 01:11:07,531
From what I hear
he means nothing to you, either,

864
01:11:09,781 --> 01:11:12,170
so you got balls
talking about forgiveness.

865
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:15,621
- That’s got nothing to do with forgiveness.
I've got children, man.

866
01:11:15,622 --> 01:11:19,157
I’ve got a family to protect.
Everything I do is for them.

867
01:11:19,158 --> 01:11:21,274
But I forgave Pop.

868
01:11:22,459 --> 01:11:24,062
Just like I forgave you and Mom.

869
01:11:31,753 --> 01:11:33,005
- You forgave us?

870
01:11:35,055 --> 01:11:36,126
- Yeah.

871
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,361
I’m not surprised
you made the tournament, Brendan.

872
01:11:39,362 --> 01:11:40,362
You got some stones, man.

873
01:11:41,736 --> 01:11:43,213
- I fell in love,

874
01:11:43,248 --> 01:11:44,447
What the hell was I supposed to do?

875
01:11:44,448 --> 01:11:46,428
- You were supposed to stick to the plan.
You were supposed to come with us.

876
01:11:46,429 --> 01:11:49,608
Mom needed you.
I needed you. You were my big brother

877
01:11:49,643 --> 01:11:50,698
and you bailed on me.

878
01:11:52,337 --> 01:11:54,624
Hey, I’m glad you stayed and
everything worked out for you,

879
01:11:55,918 --> 01:11:57,210
you leave, you get the opposite.

880
01:11:59,385 --> 01:12:01,868
You leave,
you get to  bury people.

881
01:12:01,869 --> 01:12:04,611
- You’re not the only one who suffered, Tommy.

882
01:12:06,857 --> 01:12:08,579
I didn’t even know she was sick.

883
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:13,797
I never even got the chance
to say goodbye to my own mother.

884
01:12:17,363 --> 01:12:18,861
You had no right to keep that from me!

885
01:12:18,896 --> 01:12:20,737
That was not your decision to make!

886
01:12:23,284 --> 01:12:24,349
- You know what?

887
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:28,095
You walk around with your pictures in your wallet;

888
01:12:28,096 --> 01:12:33,801
and you’re all,
I forgive you, I forgive Pop.

889
01:12:35,104 --> 01:12:37,269
I forgive everyone.
But you know what?

890
01:12:39,449 --> 01:12:40,805
You’re full of shit.

891
01:12:47,401 --> 01:12:48,600
Are we done, Brendan?

892
01:12:48,635 --> 01:12:49,864
Are we finished?

893
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:14,704
You realize you’re supposed to seek
my wise counsel when school’s actually in session, right?

894
01:13:14,705 --> 01:13:15,705
- Yes, Mr.Zito.

895
01:13:17,266 --> 01:13:20,342
We want to use the auditorium
this weekend to watch Mr. C in Sparta.

896
01:13:21,282 --> 01:13:22,349
What do you say?

897
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:26,114
So, you want to use the auditorium
to watch a  suspended teacher...

898
01:13:26,115 --> 01:13:28,492
engage in the activity he was suspended for?

899
01:13:28,493 --> 01:13:29,493
Am I hearing this correctly?

900
01:13:32,175 --> 01:13:33,605
It can turn into fund raiser, you know?

901
01:13:33,606 --> 01:13:35,980
I gotta talk to your parents.

902
01:13:35,981 --> 01:13:38,559
Because, you guys might need
to be in summer school after all.

903
01:13:41,356 --> 01:13:43,716
The gym’s the only place that’s big enough.
To fit everyone.

904
01:13:43,717 --> 01:13:44,717
- It’s never gonna happen.

905
01:13:44,718 --> 01:13:45,718
- What if we get a petition signed?

906
01:13:50,104 --> 01:13:53,192
I appreciate that you guys love your teacher.
I really do.

907
01:13:53,193 --> 01:13:56,190
But there is nothing I can do for you.

908
01:14:30,344 --> 01:14:33,877
<i>The roof is about to blow clean off
Boardwalk Hall Arena! </i>

909
01:14:33,878 --> 01:14:38,740
<i>It might be Fourth of July weekend,
but this is  Christmas Eve for fight fans! </i>

910
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:39,741
<i>This  is Atlantic City! </i>

911
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,027
<i>This is the War on the Shore! </i>

912
01:14:43,028 --> 01:14:46,083
<i>And this is what everyone has been waiting for! </i>

913
01:14:46,084 --> 01:14:50,891
<i>Sixteen of the baddest men on the planet
duking it out over a 24-hour period </i>

914
01:14:50,892 --> 01:14:54,378
<i>for the largest purse in Mixed Martial Arts history.</i>

915
01:14:54,379 --> 01:14:57,563
<i>In the town everyone knows
from the game of Monopoly, </i>

916
01:14:57,564 --> 01:15:00,437
<i>we’ve got ourselves a winner-take-all affair. </i>

917
01:15:00,438 --> 01:15:02,456
<i>Buckle your seatbelts,</i>

918
01:15:02,491 --> 01:15:03,732
<i> roll the dice, </i>

919
01:15:03,733 --> 01:15:06,071
<i>and take riiiiide
on the Reading. </i>

920
01:15:06,072 --> 01:15:09,289
<i>Sparta.
Is. Here! </i>

921
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:11,577
Welcome,
I’m Bryan Callen;

922
01:15:11,578 --> 01:15:14,135
along with best-selling fight author Sam Sheridan.

923
01:15:14,136 --> 01:15:19,462
Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta,
he wanted to create, quite simply,

924
01:15:19,463 --> 01:15:23,208
the biggest Mixed Martial Arts
spectacle in history.

925
01:15:23,209 --> 01:15:25,366
- Five million dollars, Bryan.

926
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:26,367
Five million dollars.

927
01:15:26,368 --> 01:15:29,265
J.J. Riley put his money
where his mouth is...

928
01:15:29,266 --> 01:15:32,437
and put up the biggest purse
this sport has ever seen.

929
01:15:32,438 --> 01:15:34,699
- It’s unprecedented, Sam.

930
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:37,969
As is the hoopla surrounding Tommy Riordan,

931
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:38,970
the war hero---

932
01:15:38,971 --> 01:15:41,677
who has become an overnight sensation...

933
01:15:41,678 --> 01:15:44,182
and captured the imagination
and attention of....

934
01:15:58,679 --> 01:15:59,717
Five minutes, Paddy.

935
01:15:59,718 --> 01:16:00,718
okay.

936
01:16:03,631 --> 01:16:09,724
<i>It looks as though the moment of truth has arrived,
because here comes Tommy Riordan. </i>

937
01:16:09,725 --> 01:16:12,266
<i>Tommy Riordan’s captured the media’s attention, </i>

938
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:13,267
<i>but the question still remains: </i>

939
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:16,948
<i>who is this guy?
And more importantly,</i>

940
01:16:16,949 --> 01:16:20,222
<i> can he compete in this talent pool?
Can he win? </i>

941
01:16:22,904 --> 01:16:25,388
<i>- I’ve gotta say the fact that I don’t know is strange. </i>

942
01:16:25,389 --> 01:16:28,142
<i>In an internet age
where there are no secrets, </i>

943
01:16:28,143 --> 01:16:29,143
<i>this guy is a complete mystery.</i>

944
01:16:29,144 --> 01:16:34,921
<i> I can’t find out anything about him.
Tommy Riordan is officially Google proof. </i>

945
01:16:42,374 --> 01:16:43,534
<i>- You gotta love this guy, Sam.</i>

946
01:16:43,535 --> 01:16:46,664
<i>No walk out music,
no sponsors, no interviews.</i>

947
01:16:46,665 --> 01:16:47,665
<i>He skipped out on the press conference. </i>

948
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:50,816
<i>Wouldn’t have his picture take for the program. </i>

949
01:16:50,817 --> 01:16:52,930
<i>He’s breaking every rule! </i>

950
01:16:52,931 --> 01:16:56,379
<i>- The only reason that
Tommy is even in this tournament is...</i>

951
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:00,659
<i> because of a  video showing him beating up
Mad Dog Grimes in the gym.</i>

952
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:05,052
<i>- But the reason a lot of his fans
are in the stands is because of another video,</i>

953
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:07,797
<i>which is even more stunning than
the Mad Dog Grimes video.</i>

954
01:17:07,798 --> 01:17:11,145
<i>Let me describe it for you folks
for the few who haven’t seen it, </i>

955
01:17:12,277 --> 01:17:15,004
<i>but Tommy Riordan ripped the door off a tank</i>

956
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:18,764
<i>in the heat of battle,
saving lives in the process,</i>

957
01:17:18,765 --> 01:17:21,085
<i>and then walked away without claiming a medal. </i>

958
01:17:21,086 --> 01:17:22,086
<i>He ripped the door off a tank! </i>

959
01:17:22,087 --> 01:17:24,483
<i>- Tommy Riordan is a genuine war hero, </i>

960
01:17:24,484 --> 01:17:27,172
<i>I’m not taking anything away from the guy.
He’s a very, very tough guy,</i>

961
01:17:27,173 --> 01:17:29,301
<i>but the tank don’t hit back. </i>

962
01:17:29,302 --> 01:17:33,364
<i>We’ve seen YouTube sensations
fail on the big stage before. </i>

963
01:17:33,365 --> 01:17:35,870
<i>- Sam. He ripped the door off a tank! </i>

964
01:17:39,001 --> 01:17:42,308
<i> Tommy Riordan definitely has his
hands full in his first opponent, </i>

965
01:17:42,309 --> 01:17:45,416
<i>Francisco Barbosa.
Barbosa is nothing to scoff at.</i>

966
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:49,408
<i>Yeah, he’s the real deal.
Very tough guy.</i>

967
01:17:49,409 --> 01:17:53,165
<i>Very high caliber fighter.
Tommy Riordan came out of nowhere, </i>

968
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:55,433
<i>and I imagine he’s going
to disappear just as quickly. </i>

969
01:18:05,334 --> 01:18:08,007
Gentlemen, you’ve been given your instructions.
I expect a clean fight.

970
01:18:08,008 --> 01:18:11,169
Obey my commands at all times.
Defend yourselves at all times.

971
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:13,371
Touch gloves,
go back, let’s do this.

972
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:27,834
<i>We’re about to get the big answer
to the big question: is Tommy Riordan for real? And here we go! </i>

973
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:35,053
<i> Barbosa’s gonna be looking for a take down. </i>

974
01:18:35,054 --> 01:18:36,054
<i>Definitely gonna be looking for a take down.</i>

975
01:18:41,308 --> 01:18:44,493
<i>Barbosa is down!
Barbosa has been knocked out! </i>

976
01:18:44,494 --> 01:18:47,633
<i>Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real! </i>

977
01:18:47,634 --> 01:18:49,866
<i>And now he’s walking out of the cage! </i>

978
01:18:49,867 --> 01:18:50,867
<i>He’s leaving the cage!</i>

979
01:18:53,419 --> 01:18:55,350
<i> There goes another rule out the window!</i>

980
01:18:58,637 --> 01:19:02,136
<i>Francisco Barbosa is out cold,
and he is out of this tournament, Bryan. </i>

981
01:20:27,805 --> 01:20:28,826
You can do this. 

982
01:20:35,643 --> 01:20:36,654
I want to hear you say it.

983
01:20:42,848 --> 01:20:43,856
I can do this. 

984
01:20:45,065 --> 01:20:46,446
Then let’s go do this. 

985
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,353
Yeah.

986
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:07,349
<i>J.J. Riley had less than 48 hours 
to fill the spot, </i>

987
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:10,456
<i>and he basically had to rely 
on the word of Frank Campana. </i>

988
01:21:10,457 --> 01:21:14,716
<i>And he chose Brendan Conlon, 
which quite frankly is something I just don’t understand. </i>

989
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:23,583
Brendan, Go get ‘em. 

990
01:21:33,512 --> 01:21:35,462
<i>I can understand coming out to no music,  </i>

991
01:21:35,463 --> 01:21:39,640
<i>by why in the world would you choose 
classical music as your entrance?</i>

992
01:21:39,641 --> 01:21:40,641
<i>This is Beethoven,
 This is Ode to Joy, Bryan.</i>

993
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:44,124
<i>My apologies, Mr. Renaissance man.</i>

994
01:21:47,505 --> 01:21:50,759
<i>You want to talk about renaissance 
 men, you gotta talk about Frank Campana. </i>

995
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,760
<i>Very unorthodox trainer,</i>

996
01:21:51,761 --> 01:21:54,154
<i>and one of the best trainer in the game. </i>

997
01:21:54,155 --> 01:21:58,291
<i>He’s well known for using classical music
 to train his fighters to remain calm, </i>

998
01:21:58,292 --> 01:22:01,900
<i>to remain patient, 
and to remain composed under pressure. </i>

999
01:22:01,901 --> 01:22:08,397
<i>Classical music is about as fitting 
to this setting as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament. </i>

1000
01:22:08,398 --> 01:22:09,398
<i>In fact, let me show you something. </i>

1001
01:22:14,019 --> 01:22:16,267
<i>That my friend, is Brendan Conlon.</i>

1002
01:22:17,445 --> 01:22:19,902
<i>Brendan Conlon is about to get dropped into a shark tank. </i>

1003
01:22:19,903 --> 01:22:20,903
<i> He’s a feeder fish.</i>

1004
01:22:21,772 --> 01:22:23,160
<i>C’mon, give the guy a break.</i>

1005
01:22:24,328 --> 01:22:29,063
<i>At least we’ve seen him fight before. 
He has been in the UFC. We remember him.</i>

1006
01:22:29,064 --> 01:22:32,236
<i>I remember him, too. 
I remember him being very unmemorable. </i>

1007
01:22:52,687 --> 01:22:55,627
<i>Midnight Le getting ready to climb
 into the cage and go to work. </i>

1008
01:22:55,628 --> 01:22:56,628
<i>When the brackets were announced, </i>

1009
01:22:56,629 --> 01:22:59,047
<i>He thought he’d be going up against Marco Santos.</i>

1010
01:22:59,048 --> 01:23:01,950
<i>He’s gotta be thrilled to be seeing 
Brendan Conlon standing across from him.</i>

1011
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:04,267
You asked for it. 

1012
01:23:04,268 --> 01:23:06,981
<i>Brendan retired from fighting some years ago, </i>

1013
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,383
<i>he’s actually a high school Physics teacher now, </i>

1014
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:12,836
<i>and Midnight had some fun with that 
at the press conference, yesterday.</i>

1015
01:23:12,837 --> 01:23:15,776
<i>He said he was gonna give 
the teacher a serious lesson, </i>

1016
01:23:15,777 --> 01:23:18,771
<i>and that getting killed 
was no way to spend a summer vacation. </i>

1017
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:38,840
Alright, guys, you’ve been given your instructions,
 I expect a clean fight. 

1018
01:23:38,841 --> 01:23:42,278
Obey my commands at all times. 
Defend yourselves at all times. 

1019
01:23:42,279 --> 01:23:44,497
Touch gloves, 
go back, let’s do this. 

1020
01:23:46,464 --> 01:23:47,652
Have some fun, baby.

1021
01:24:09,707 --> 01:24:10,624
Move! You gotta move! 

1022
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:50,135
<i>Midnight is all over Brendan. </i>

1023
01:24:50,136 --> 01:24:52,888
<i>This can’t last much longer. 
This won’t last much longer.</i>

1024
01:24:52,923 --> 01:24:54,446
<i> The teacher just has no answers. </i>

1025
01:24:58,924 --> 01:25:01,308
<i>And now he’s got the hooks in. </i>

1026
01:26:00,718 --> 01:26:03,178
Beautiful! Beautiful! 
He doesn’t know what hit him! 

1027
01:28:26,715 --> 01:28:27,697
<i>Midnight is in big trouble!</i>

1028
01:28:45,108 --> 01:28:47,836
<i>This isn’t happening!
 This can’t  happen! </i>

1029
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:53,260
<i>Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight!
 I can’t believe it!</i>

1030
01:29:04,359 --> 01:29:07,724
He tapped him out! He tapped him out!
 He did it! He did it! He did  it! 

1031
01:29:12,582 --> 01:29:15,027
<i> This is what so great about Mixed Martial Arts.</i>

1032
01:29:15,028 --> 01:29:16,028
<i>There’s so many ways to lose.</i>

1033
01:29:16,029 --> 01:29:20,712
<i> One tiny miscalculation 
anyone can win at any time. </i>

1034
01:29:20,713 --> 01:29:26,306
<i>Frank Campana embracing his man, I don’t think 
either one of them can believe what just happened. </i>

1035
01:29:28,387 --> 01:29:30,442
<i>Great show of sportsmanship from the teacher. </i>

1036
01:29:31,542 --> 01:29:34,458
<i>That’s a hallmark of Frank Campana’s 
philosophy right there.</i>

1037
01:29:37,755 --> 01:29:39,230
<i>Midnight Le is shocked. </i>

1038
01:29:39,231 --> 01:29:42,430
<i>He thought he had a free pass into the second round,
 but instead he’s going home.</i>

1039
01:29:42,431 --> 01:29:46,544
<i> He dominated the fight the entire way,
 but fell prey to a very technical finish. </i>

1040
01:29:46,545 --> 01:29:49,006
<i>Very technical finish, 
but come on, that’s a fluke. </i>

1041
01:29:51,105 --> 01:29:52,034
<i>You call it a fluke. </i>

1042
01:29:52,035 --> 01:29:55,377
<i>I call it a guy maintaining composure 
and waiting for his opportunity.</i>

1043
01:29:57,055 --> 01:29:58,921
<i>Conlon beats Midnight! </i>

1044
01:29:58,922 --> 01:29:59,922
<i>Unbelievable!!!</i>

1045
01:30:02,025 --> 01:30:03,861
<i>I hope you got a receipt for your goldfish.</i>

1046
01:30:26,072 --> 01:30:27,076
“I WON!!!!!!!!”

1047
01:30:27,111 --> 01:30:28,125
 Yes! 

1048
01:30:42,904 --> 01:30:44,949
<i>We’re down to eight fighters, 
soon to be seven </i>

1049
01:30:44,950 --> 01:30:47,772
<i>as Koba prepares to go to work 
for the second time tonight. </i>

1050
01:31:23,986 --> 01:31:25,994
<i>Here comes the underdog, Brendan Conlon.</i>

1051
01:31:25,995 --> 01:31:28,269
<i>The teacher miraculously 
passed his first test, </i>

1052
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:29,270
<i>but now he’s gotta face The Dane. </i>

1053
01:31:30,474 --> 01:31:32,757
Brendan, You can do it. 

1054
01:31:35,637 --> 01:31:38,090
<i>Halfway through round three now 
and the beating continues.</i>

1055
01:31:38,091 --> 01:31:42,249
<i>I honestly don’t know 
how Brendan Conlon is still standing, Sam.</i>

1056
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:45,910
<i>He has been absolutely battered 
in both his fights tonight. </i>

1057
01:31:54,763 --> 01:31:55,746
Take him down! 

1058
01:32:28,372 --> 01:32:29,349
 Way to go, Brendan! 

1059
01:32:30,131 --> 01:32:31,239
I’m doing it ! 

1060
01:32:31,274 --> 01:32:32,282
OK, son. 

1061
01:32:34,904 --> 01:32:37,425
<i>The crowd catching fire
 for war hero Tommy Riordan. </i>

1062
01:32:41,705 --> 01:32:43,706
<i>He doesn’t seem to want anything 
to do with all this adulation,</i>

1063
01:32:43,741 --> 01:32:44,879
<i>He’s just here to fight. </i>

1064
01:32:48,157 --> 01:32:49,037
Gentlemen, you ready? 

1065
01:32:50,771 --> 01:32:51,813
You ready? 

1066
01:32:51,814 --> 01:32:52,814
Let’s go to war! 

1067
01:32:55,141 --> 01:32:56,858
Here he comes again like a buzzsaw. 

1068
01:33:00,511 --> 01:33:02,501
He's is all over Diego Santana! 

1069
01:33:21,224 --> 01:33:26,634
<i>Tommy Riordan marching through the crowd,
 and straight into the final four! </i>

1070
01:33:26,635 --> 01:33:27,635
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen.</i>

1071
01:34:12,882 --> 01:34:13,987
Can’t sleep, huh? 

1072
01:34:21,276 --> 01:34:24,708
I know that other thing’s...

1073
01:34:27,056 --> 01:34:28,480
bothering the hell out of you, 

1074
01:34:30,977 --> 01:34:32,549
I’m proud of you. Tommy.

1075
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:35,932
What you did for that kid  in the tank? 

1076
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:38,832
That was really something. 

1077
01:34:42,774 --> 01:34:44,561
How about deserting my unit? 

1078
01:34:46,386 --> 01:34:47,895
Is that really something, too?

1079
01:34:51,757 --> 01:34:52,768
 Yeah.

1080
01:34:52,769 --> 01:34:56,820
I was on my way outta country 
when I  came across those guys. 

1081
01:34:58,543 --> 01:35:00,344
What was I supposed to do, let ‘em drown? 

1082
01:35:00,345 --> 01:35:01,345
No. 

1083
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:05,848
What’d you do? 

1084
01:35:05,849 --> 01:35:06,849
What’d I do? 

1085
01:35:09,877 --> 01:35:11,086
I took off. 

1086
01:35:14,968 --> 01:35:16,499
That’s why you go by Riordan. 

1087
01:35:18,436 --> 01:35:20,508
That’s why they
can’t find your service records. 

1088
01:35:24,854 --> 01:35:26,740
What the hell happened over there, Tommy? 

1089
01:35:28,884 --> 01:35:30,437
That is none of your business.

1090
01:35:30,438 --> 01:35:33,066
Come on, kiddo. I’ve been there.

1091
01:35:33,067 --> 01:35:35,463
I’ve done it. I’ve seen it.

1092
01:35:35,464 --> 01:35:37,936
You can trust me.
 I’ll understand. 

1093
01:35:37,937 --> 01:35:40,458
Spare me the compassionate father routine, Pop. 

1094
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,573
The suit don’t fit.

1095
01:35:44,984 --> 01:35:48,225
Tommy, I’m really trying here.

1096
01:35:50,059 --> 01:35:51,118
 You’re trying? 

1097
01:35:52,752 --> 01:35:53,815
Now?

1098
01:35:56,598 --> 01:35:57,836
Where were you when it mattered? 

1099
01:35:59,957 --> 01:36:02,614
I needed this guy back when I was a kid.

1100
01:36:02,615 --> 01:36:03,615
 I don’t need you now. 

1101
01:36:05,237 --> 01:36:07,462
It’s too late now. 
Everything’s already happened.

1102
01:36:09,313 --> 01:36:11,220
 You and Brendan don’t seem to understand that.

1103
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:14,797
 Let me explain something to you, okay?

1104
01:36:16,042 --> 01:36:19,773
the only thing I have in common 
with Brendan Conlon is that;

1105
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:24,789
the pair of us, 
we have absolutely no use for you.

1106
01:36:29,692 --> 01:36:30,901
Look at you.

1107
01:36:33,101 --> 01:36:34,700
Yeah, I was right.

1108
01:36:34,701 --> 01:36:37,478
I think I liked you better when you were a drunk. 

1109
01:36:37,479 --> 01:36:38,479
At least you had some balls then. 

1110
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,480
Not like now.

1111
01:36:39,481 --> 01:36:40,481
Tip toeing around like some---

1112
01:36:42,513 --> 01:36:44,058
beggar with your cup out. 

1113
01:36:46,964 --> 01:36:48,163
Take it somewhere else, old man. 

1114
01:36:48,164 --> 01:36:49,164
In fact, you know what?

1115
01:36:49,165 --> 01:36:51,495
Here’s a cup. Why don’t you take this 

1116
01:36:51,496 --> 01:36:53,659
and go buy some more of your shitty tapes? 

1117
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:57,992
Go back to the room and 
you listen to some more fish stories.. 

1118
01:36:57,993 --> 01:36:58,993
no one gives a shit about. 

1119
01:36:58,994 --> 01:36:59,994
Get outta here. 

1120
01:37:02,573 --> 01:37:03,871
Get the fuck outta here! 

1121
01:38:04,623 --> 01:38:06,847
Ishmael! God pity ‘em!

1122
01:38:06,848 --> 01:38:11,143
 Stop the ship!
 Please stop the ship! 

1123
01:38:17,097 --> 01:38:20,991
Ahab! You Godless sonofabitch! 

1124
01:38:20,992 --> 01:38:26,965
You stop the ship, 
you Godless sonofabitch! 

1125
01:38:42,495 --> 01:38:50,692
Captain.
 Oh captain. Stop the ship. 

1126
01:39:45,061 --> 01:39:46,287
We’re lost. 

1127
01:39:48,359 --> 01:39:49,871
We’re all lost, Tommy. 

1128
01:39:52,974 --> 01:39:54,617
We’ll never make it back.

1129
01:39:57,193 --> 01:39:58,626
We’ll never make it back.

1130
01:40:17,682 --> 01:40:22,840
I always loved you. 
You know that, don’t you Tommy? 

1131
01:40:24,288 --> 01:40:25,859
I always loved you. 

1132
01:40:27,704 --> 01:40:30,739
You and your brother.
 My two  boys. 

1133
01:41:03,593 --> 01:41:05,946
<i>Tommy Riordan, 
coming down the tunnel without his trainer. </i>

1134
01:41:11,947 --> 01:41:13,558
<i> Once again, no walk out music. </i>

1135
01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:19,183
<i>I wouldn’t say no walk out music, Sam. </i>

1136
01:41:25,346 --> 01:41:29,554
<i> Bryan, It sounds like VJ Day in Times Square,. 
I’ve never seen anything like it! </i>

1137
01:41:47,297 --> 01:41:49,594
<i>Tommy acknowledging his comrades for the first time,</i>

1138
01:41:49,595 --> 01:41:51,600
<i> and climbing into the cage. </i>

1139
01:41:56,931 --> 01:42:01,407
<i>Mad Dog Grimes has been looking for revenge 
ever since the day Tommy Riordan walked into his gym in Pittsburgh </i>

1140
01:42:01,408 --> 01:42:02,408
<i>and turned his life upside down. </i>

1141
01:42:03,890 --> 01:42:07,546
<i>It’s been a very long, very miserable 
few months for Mad Dog to say the least. </i>

1142
01:42:09,597 --> 01:42:16,218
<i>Mocking Tommy with a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight 
and the Marines are really letting Mad Dog have it. </i>

1143
01:42:26,676 --> 01:42:28,219
Alright gentlemen, 
you’ve been given your instructions. 

1144
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:32,392
I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. 
Defend yourselves at all times.

1145
01:42:32,393 --> 01:42:34,837
 Touch gloves, go back, 
let’s do this. 

1146
01:42:34,838 --> 01:42:35,838
- It’s not gonna happen again. 

1147
01:42:41,695 --> 01:42:45,251
<i>He predicted an early knockout. 
Said he was gonna knock Tommy out with one punch. </i>

1148
01:42:48,698 --> 01:42:50,443
<i>Let’s see what Tommy 
has to say about that.</i>

1149
01:42:52,998 --> 01:42:54,081
Gentlemen, you ready? 

1150
01:42:55,474 --> 01:42:57,203
You ready? 

1151
01:42:58,309 --> 01:42:59,745
Let’s go to war! 

1152
01:42:59,746 --> 01:43:00,746
<i>And they are off! </i>

1153
01:43:02,332 --> 01:43:03,640
<i>Tommy tackles him and he’s on top!</i>

1154
01:43:04,721 --> 01:43:05,689
<i> He’s raining blows! </i>

1155
01:43:13,771 --> 01:43:14,964
Stop it! Stop the fight! 

1156
01:43:22,089 --> 01:43:23,727
<i>That’s the fastest knockout
 I think I’ve ever seen. </i>

1157
01:43:23,728 --> 01:43:26,070
<i>Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed. </i>

1158
01:43:26,071 --> 01:43:27,071
<i>He is not moving. </i>

1159
01:43:29,324 --> 01:43:32,442
<i>You do that to someone on the street and they’d 
lock you up and throw away the key! </i>

1160
01:43:32,443 --> 01:43:33,443
Break out the yellow tape, Sam. 

1161
01:43:34,849 --> 01:43:37,065
<i>This guy's walking away from the cage 
like he’s leaving a crime scene. </i>

1162
01:44:30,074 --> 01:44:34,027
<i>Brendan Conlon came into this tournament
 as a 1000 to 1 underdog,</i>

1163
01:44:34,028 --> 01:44:35,028
<i>and now here he is in the final four. </i>

1164
01:44:35,029 --> 01:44:39,440
<i>The crowd’s showing their appreciation.
 He's getting quite the reception. </i>

1165
01:44:39,441 --> 01:44:40,441
<i>He’s getting a huge reception.</i>

1166
01:44:40,442 --> 01:44:42,994
<i>I mean, 
this guy shocked everybody! </i>

1167
01:44:49,326 --> 01:44:50,283
You’ve got a visitor.

1168
01:44:53,176 --> 01:44:54,447
 Second row, 10 o’clock. 

1169
01:45:03,812 --> 01:45:04,948
You alright with that? 

1170
01:45:14,572 --> 01:45:16,235
<i>And here comes the great Russian Koba. </i>

1171
01:45:16,236 --> 01:45:18,398
<i>Koba is so intimidating. </i>

1172
01:45:18,433 --> 01:45:20,323
<i>His reputation is larger than life.</i>

1173
01:45:29,231 --> 01:45:30,972
I want you to look right at him 
when he comes in here. 

1174
01:45:33,142 --> 01:45:34,409
Don’t take your eyes off him. 

1175
01:46:03,033 --> 01:46:06,218
I’m proud of you brother. 
This is your cage. 

1176
01:46:28,519 --> 01:46:30,812
Alright, gentlemen, you’ve been given 
your instructions. I expect a clean fight. 

1177
01:46:30,813 --> 01:46:31,813
Obey my commands at all times.

1178
01:46:31,814 --> 01:46:34,195
Defend yourselves at all times. 

1179
01:46:34,196 --> 01:46:35,196
Touch gloves, 
go back, let’s do this. 

1180
01:46:40,824 --> 01:46:42,280
<i>Should I be nervous for Brendan?</i>

1181
01:46:42,281 --> 01:46:45,637
<i>‘Cause I am. I want to stop the 
fight before it gets going.</i>

1182
01:46:51,526 --> 01:46:52,535
Gentlemen, you ready? 

1183
01:46:53,608 --> 01:46:55,351
You ready? 

1184
01:46:55,386 --> 01:46:56,260
Let’s go to war! 

1185
01:46:56,261 --> 01:47:00,303
<i>Now the question is,
 how long can Brendan Conlon stay alive? </i>

1186
01:47:26,233 --> 01:47:27,661
<i>Koba just pounding on Brendan Conlon! 
He’s pounding on him like a side of beef! </i>

1187
01:47:35,222 --> 01:47:36,370
<i>Koba’s got him in the air. Oh no!</i>

1188
01:47:46,441 --> 01:47:48,309
<i> How much abuse can one man take? </i>

1189
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:49,310
Let’s go to war! 

1190
01:47:58,785 --> 01:47:59,924
<i>Uh oh, Brendan’s going for ride! </i>

1191
01:48:01,725 --> 01:48:03,270
<i> That one shook the entire building! </i>

1192
01:48:45,654 --> 01:48:47,362
Sit down.

1193
01:48:48,586 --> 01:48:49,989
 Breathe.  Breathe. 

1194
01:48:49,990 --> 01:48:50,990
Look at me! 

1195
01:48:50,991 --> 01:48:51,991
Look at me! 

1196
01:48:59,393 --> 01:49:00,450
Why are we here?

1197
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:01,451
Why are we here, Brendan?

1198
01:49:12,326 --> 01:49:14,292
You don't knock him out,
you loose the fight.

1199
01:49:14,293 --> 01:49:15,293
Do you understand me?

1200
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:18,426
You don't knock him out,

1201
01:49:19,208 --> 01:49:20,504
You don't have a home.

1202
01:49:48,823 --> 01:49:51,952
<i>Conlon somehow answering the bell for round three, </i>

1203
01:49:51,953 --> 01:49:52,953
<i>but Koba’s all over him again. </i>

1204
01:49:57,740 --> 01:49:59,043
<i>Brendan’s giving back, Bryan. </i>

1205
01:49:59,044 --> 01:50:01,327
<i>There are signs of life in Brendan Conlon.</i>

1206
01:50:01,328 --> 01:50:02,328
<i> He’s starting to mix it up! </i>

1207
01:50:23,891 --> 01:50:28,715
<i>Koba’s got him caught in an iron vice, 
squeezing for all it’s worth and trying to choke the teacher out. </i>

1208
01:50:37,316 --> 01:50:38,101
<i>He just launched Koba!
Can you believe this? </i>

1209
01:50:38,102 --> 01:50:40,425
<i>Conlon just shook off a guillotine! </i>

1210
01:51:10,479 --> 01:51:12,835
<i>This is a fight! 
We’ve got ourselves a fight! </i>

1211
01:51:19,837 --> 01:51:21,862
<i>Conlon going for a knee bar! 
He’s got it very deep! </i>

1212
01:51:31,888 --> 01:51:32,823
Crank it! Crank it! 

1213
01:51:35,714 --> 01:51:38,627
<i>Brendan Conlon wrenching
 that knee for all it’s worth! </i>

1214
01:51:38,628 --> 01:51:43,671
<i>He’s putting everything he has in it, 
and Koba  is screaming in pain! </i>

1215
01:51:46,102 --> 01:51:48,591
<i>Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!
 I can’t believe it!</i>

1216
01:51:59,865 --> 01:52:02,731
<i>Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba! </i>

1217
01:52:17,867 --> 01:52:20,057
<i>That’s gotta be the biggest upset in MMA history!</i>

1218
01:52:31,474 --> 01:52:32,971
<i>Brendan Conlon, the Physics teacher! </i>

1219
01:52:32,972 --> 01:52:36,624
<i>Brendan Conlon, the civilian!
 He’s done the impossible! </i>

1220
01:52:37,848 --> 01:52:44,781
<i>He’s pulled off a miracle!
 This  place is going crazy ‘cause we’ve just seen a miracle! </i>

1221
01:52:57,117 --> 01:52:58,913
This is CNN breaking news... 

1222
01:53:00,198 --> 01:53:03,895
<i>A surprising turn in the story of 
Iraq War hero Tommy Riordan.</i>

1223
01:53:03,896 --> 01:53:10,010
<i>CNN has learned that Riordan’s true 
identity is that of Marine Staff Sergeant Thomas Conlon, </i>

1224
01:53:10,011 --> 01:53:16,019
<i>who went AWOL from his unit earlier this 
year following the friendly fire death of his brother-in-arms, </i>

1225
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:17,020
<i>Sergeant Manny Fernandez.</i>

1226
01:53:17,021 --> 01:53:23,011
<i>Fernandez’ wife, Pilar Fernandez, 
spoke with me in an exclusive interview moments ago. </i>

1227
01:53:24,578 --> 01:53:26,083
Bombs started dropping. 

1228
01:53:27,368 --> 01:53:29,288
They were coming from U.S. planes. 

1229
01:53:29,289 --> 01:53:36,970
Tommy and Manny were waving their flags 
to let them know they were Americans, 

1230
01:53:36,971 --> 01:53:41,109
 but they didn’t stop. 
Everyone died. 

1231
01:53:42,679 --> 01:53:43,911
Everyone except Tommy. 

1232
01:53:45,588 --> 01:53:47,042
You know, my Manny used to say,

1233
01:53:51,628 --> 01:53:53,148
Tommy was the brother he never had. 

1234
01:53:55,004 --> 01:53:58,450
<i>Conlon, who is fighting in the Mixed Martial Arts
 mega tournament Sparta, </i>

1235
01:53:58,451 --> 01:54:05,232
<i>is expected to be taken into custody by military police 
following tonight’s winner take all finale in Atlantic City. </i>

1236
01:54:05,233 --> 01:54:06,233
<i>If victorious,</i>

1237
01:54:06,234 --> 01:54:12,003
<i>he has pledged his five million dollar purse to the 
widow of his fallen comrade. </i>

1238
01:54:13,846 --> 01:54:17,258
<i>We’ve just got some incredible news 
that I’m having trouble putting into context, </i>

1239
01:54:17,259 --> 01:54:18,259
<i>but here it is:</i>

1240
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:22,415
<i>the two men fighting for the championship tonight, </i>

1241
01:54:22,416 --> 01:54:27,321
<i>for the five million dollar prize, 
for the middle weight championship of the world, </i>

1242
01:54:28,492 --> 01:54:29,763
<i>are brothers. </i>

1243
01:55:15,768 --> 01:55:16,964
 What are you gonna do? 

1244
01:55:22,522 --> 01:55:23,644
I’m gonna fight him. 

1245
02:04:13,334 --> 02:04:14,373
I popped his shoulder.

1246
02:04:14,374 --> 02:04:15,374
Relax, breathe. 

1247
02:04:16,684 --> 02:04:17,724
I heard it tear. 

1248
02:04:17,725 --> 02:04:20,492
 You popped his shoulder? Good. 
I want you to pop his other shoulder.

1249
02:04:22,094 --> 02:04:22,993
 Josh! 

1250
02:04:22,994 --> 02:04:23,994
Hey! Hey! No Josh!

1251
02:04:23,995 --> 02:04:24,995
Look at me!

1252
02:04:24,996 --> 02:04:25,996
Look at me!

1253
02:04:25,997 --> 02:04:29,595
You got two rounds left!
 You need both rounds!

1254
02:04:43,739 --> 02:04:46,643
 Go in there, kick him in the head,
 take him down, and finish  him! 

1255
02:04:54,597 --> 02:04:56,372
Tommy! What are you doing? 

1256
02:04:57,536 --> 02:04:58,593
Shut up! C’mon. 

1257
02:05:03,855 --> 02:05:05,189
What are you that crazy? 

1258
02:05:06,810 --> 02:05:07,863
 Let’s go to war!

1259
02:05:15,426 --> 02:05:17,913
 It’s over!
What are you doing?

1260
02:05:19,513 --> 02:05:20,598
It’s over, Tommy. 

1261
02:06:20,742 --> 02:06:22,336
 Finish him! You finish him! 

1262
02:06:41,863 --> 02:06:43,016
Break! Break!
