00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:06,615
RICHARD MILES: The Roman Empire
was the most successful

2
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,459
the world had ever known.

3
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:15,816
At its peak, in the second century AD,
it covered 5 million square kilometres.

4
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:21,178
From Hadrian's Wall in the north

5
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:24,421
to ancient Mesopotamia in the east.

6
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:32,895
All of it run by a system of remarkable
efficiency and stability.

7
00:00:34,027 --> 00:00:38,418
They called it Pax Romana,
the Roman eace.

8
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:43,179
And its benefits were enjoyed
by 60 million people.

9
00:00:43,587 --> 00:00:44,622
(BLEATING)

10
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:50,541
The Romans would proudly boast
of having come up

11
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:52,902
with the final word on civilisation.

12
00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:58,182
Peace, security and prosperity,
all underwritten by an imperial power

13
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,303
with a civilising mission.

14
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:03,379
As long as you got with the programme,
paid your taxes,

15
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:06,982
committed to the Empire
and, of course, kept the peace,

16
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,820
the benefits of civilisation
would come to you.

17
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:12,145
What more could anyone want?

18
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:21,816
The answer was more than
the Pax Romana could supply.

19
00:01:22,827 --> 00:01:28,185
This mighty empire would endure
some mad, bad and dangerous emperors,

20
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:30,827
but in the end it would be subverted

21
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:33,421
by an obscure religious cult
from the East.

22
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:35,899
(CONGREGATION SINGING)

23
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:39,418
Its followers would reject,
not just Rome

24
00:01:39,507 --> 00:01:44,183
but all that Rome had come to mean
in the story of civilisation.

25
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:51,184
The city of man would be eclipsed
by the city of God.

26
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:33,179
Here's a rare thing in our story
of the ancient world,

27
00:02:33,707 --> 00:02:36,665
a massive, expensive public monument,

28
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:41,705
dedicated not to some blood-soaked
triumph over a cringing enemy

29
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:46,101
but to that elusive, precious thing
called peace.

30
00:02:47,707 --> 00:02:51,905
Surely the greatest good
that human civilisation can aspire to.

31
00:02:56,627 --> 00:03:01,018
It was created at the behest of the man
who established the Pax Romana.

32
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:08,258
Augustus, Rome's first Emperor.

33
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:15,057
This is the Ara acis,
the Altar of Peace,

34
00:03:15,147 --> 00:03:18,423
built by Augustus in 1 3 BC.

35
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:20,259
On this frieze here,

36
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,815
it shows Augustus coming back
from campaign.

37
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:25,906
The gaurantor and author of peace.

38
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:31,420
Quite a transformation
from the teenage warlord

39
00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:34,465
who repeatedly ripped out the eyes
of one of his enemies.

40
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:44,062
Eighteen years earlier, plain old
Octavian Caesar, as he was then,

41
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:47,704
was the last man standing
in the brutal civil wars

42
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:49,778
that had torn
the Roman Republic apart.

43
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,904
As victor, he'd faced a simple choice,

44
00:03:57,347 --> 00:04:01,420
resuscitate the Republic
ruled by the Senate and the people

45
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:03,425
or put it out of its misery.

46
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:10,104
But the canny Octavian,
rebranded ''Augustus'; found a third way.

47
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:15,178
He killed the Republic's soul
but kept its body alive.

48
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:22,062
On the frieze, we see Augustus
with three main constituencies.

49
00:04:22,987 --> 00:04:25,103
The first of these is the Senate,

50
00:04:25,187 --> 00:04:26,825
because Augustus was going to claim

51
00:04:26,907 --> 00:04:29,296
that he was going to restore
the Roman Republic.

52
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:34,063
And to do that he needed to restore
the dignity and authority of the Senate.

53
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:37,705
The second group are the priesthood,

54
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:40,904
because Augustus was going to claim
that he is going to restore

55
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:42,625
traditional Roman religion.

56
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:45,860
But the third group is a real novelty.

57
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:50,022
We can see them up here.
Women and children.

58
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:53,459
These are members
of Augustus's immediate family.

59
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:55,141
It was Augustus who wanted to get

60
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:57,661
the people of Rome
used to a new concept.

61
00:04:57,747 --> 00:04:59,942
An imperial dynasty.

62
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:06,704
As Augustus knew,
Romans had a visceral hatred of kings.

63
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:12,138
To plant his dynasty firmly
in this hostile soil,

64
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:15,977
Augustus had to master
a tricky political manoeuvre.

65
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:22,464
A Roman writer would later define
it as 'getting higher by stepping down''.

66
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:30,780
You can see what that meant in practice
in another public monument,

67
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:34,218
erected 30 years
after the Altar of eace.

68
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:39,417
The Res Gestae, literally
''The Things Done'; by Augustus,

69
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:41,857
is the carefully doctored Cv

70
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:47,579
of the man who brought the principles of
monarchy back to Rome after 500 years.

71
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:59,019
As a public testament,
the Res Gestae,

72
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:01,575
is a very odd document indeed.

73
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,101
Most Roman aristocrats on their epitaphs

74
00:06:04,187 --> 00:06:07,702
will be boasting about their honours
and offices that they are decrewed.

75
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:11,144
But the Res Gestae
does the diametric opposite.

76
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:16,104
On it, Augustus boasts about the offices
that he has turned down.

77
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:17,740
So up here, we've got...

78
00:06:17,987 --> 00:06:19,784
''The dictatorship,
which was offered to me

79
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:23,496
''in my absence and presence
by the people and Senate of Rome,

80
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:25,380
''I didn't take it.

81
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:29,296
''The consulship,
offered to me annually and eternally,

82
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:31,219
''I didn't take it.

83
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:34,900
''The coronation crown
that was offered to me,

84
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:36,022
''I didn't accept it.''

85
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:44,182
One title that
the self-denying Augustus did accept

86
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:48,096
was Pater Patriae,
Father of the Country.

87
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:57,897
And he garnished it with a
disingenuous little phrase

88
00:06:57,987 --> 00:07:02,105
that added more smoke and mirrors
to this monarchy in disguise.

89
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:08,899
rimus inter pares,
or first amongst equals,

90
00:07:08,987 --> 00:07:13,060
would remain the modus operandi
for all emperors after Augustus.

91
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,621
Augustus would maintain the charade
of visiting the Senate House

92
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:20,175
and seeking advice from its leaders.

93
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:24,540
And even half the provinces
would remain in senatorial control,

94
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:29,135
but they tended to be the ones
that didn't have large standing armies,

95
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:30,342
just in case.

96
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:38,346
The dead hand
of the Father of the Country

97
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:41,146
weighed heavily here in the Senate.

98
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:47,706
Woe betide the Senator who
failed to do Augustus's bidding.

99
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:54,782
And so the habits of debate and dissent
shrivelled and died.

100
00:07:57,547 --> 00:07:59,538
(BELL TOLLING)

101
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:10,777
Augustus lived long enough to see
his imperial system take firm root.

102
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:14,459
But its resilience was tested
by what came next,

103
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:31,026
a succession of rulers
that gives the term ''Roman Emperor''

104
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:34,656
its lurid associations with vanity,

105
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:38,386
debauchery

106
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:40,856
and insanity.

107
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,667
This hall is literally full of emperors

108
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:51,021
and as you can see,
they come in various shapes and sizes.

109
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,386
One of the interesting things
about the Empire

110
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,506
is it often didn't seem to matter
what the man at the top was like.

111
00:08:58,587 --> 00:09:00,976
He could be mad, bad and dangerous.

112
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,661
But the Empire
just carried on regardless.

113
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:11,546
The machinery of Empire,
trade, tax collecting and public works,

114
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:15,297
rarely missed a beat,
but the imperial system

115
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:18,658
distorted the values and ideals of Rome.

116
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:26,264
For Rome's elite, life under an emperor
was a form of exquisite torture.

117
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:29,820
The closer you got
to the centre of power,

118
00:09:29,907 --> 00:09:33,104
the greater your chances
of an untimely death.

119
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:38,946
Such unspoken inequalities
often created embarrassing

120
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:41,541
and even dangerous situations.

121
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:44,665
The Emperor Claudius,
who often got things wrong,

122
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:48,342
used to turn up at senators' houses
for dinner, uninvited,

123
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:52,542
leaving his hosts to sit there quaking
in their boots over dinner

124
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:55,460
as his bodyguards served up the food.

125
00:09:55,987 --> 00:09:59,263
And one obsequious senator
threw himself at the feet

126
00:09:59,347 --> 00:10:02,623
of the aged Emperor Tiberius,
knocking him over.

127
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:06,304
And he almost ended up
with a guardsman's sword in his guts.

128
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:14,018
Many senators embraced Stoicism.

129
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:16,138
The cultivation of indifference

130
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:19,219
in the face of life's trials
and tribulations,

131
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,817
as a psychological defence mechanism

132
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:25,024
against these arbitrary
and dangerous times.

133
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:35,099
Many of them decided to exercise
the ultimate freedom

134
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:37,826
that they still had left under a tyrant.

135
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:42,180
And that was choosing the manner
and the time of their own deaths.

136
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:47,942
So there was a whole series
of senatorial suicides.

137
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:51,379
Including men inviting
all their friends to dinner,

138
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:56,257
where they read poetry, ate something,
and then they went off to the baths

139
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:59,783
where the guy who was going
to commit suicide slashed his wrists.

140
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:04,663
But then in another twist,
one of these guys

141
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,578
had his hands bandaged up again,

142
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:08,982
and he went out again,
spent some more time

143
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:11,979
discussing things with his friends
before going back in

144
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:15,218
and having the bandages removed
where he bled to death.

145
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,096
While Rome's imperial system drove its
elite to suicide,

146
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:28,136
the masses were encouraged
to behave like spoilt brats.

147

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

148
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:34,822
The million-strong population of Rome
was always one grievance away

149
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:36,863
from becoming a million-strong mob.

150
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:43,976
And so smart emperors kept it sweet
with panem et circenses,

151
00:11:45,347 --> 00:11:47,178
bread and circuses.

152
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:52,983
The bread came first.

153
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:58,346
Augustus handed out a free monthly dole
of grain to 200,000 Romans,

154
00:11:58,987 --> 00:12:01,455
one-fifth of the city's population.

155
00:12:01,547 --> 00:12:03,105
He could afford to be generous

156
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:06,941
because Rome had acquired
the ancient world's great bread basket,

157
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,745
North Africa.

158
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:16,740
The abundant fruits of empire
helped fill the bellies of the Romans

159
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:18,385
and kept them quiet.

160
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:24,896
There was a trading boom
in the Mediterranean

161
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:29,219
unprecedented in the ancient world
as ships headed to Rome,

162
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:34,381
laden with grain, building materials
and amphora full of olive oil.

163
00:12:37,587 --> 00:12:39,418
So much for the bread,

164
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:41,816
but the plebs
also demanded stronger meat.

The Roman games had
gladiators, chariots and wild beasts.

00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:21,345
In this murky, subterranean world,
animals and men would wait

173
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:23,816
before they were taken up
to the arena above,

174
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:26,705
to die for the entertainment
of the crowds there.

175
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:30,537
The Roman Empire,
built on bread and circuses,

176
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:32,822
cheap food and cheap thrills.

177
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,346
(PEOPLE APPLAUDING)

178
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:40,582
The grim theatre of death
that played out on the sandy floor

179
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:44,376
of the amphitheatre
was accompanied by cut and thrust

180
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:45,946
of a more subtle kind.

181
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:52,302
The political interaction
that took place between the crowd

182
00:13:52,387 --> 00:13:53,536
and their emperor.

183
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:58,215
There were ways of doing it,
and ways of not doing it.

184
00:13:58,307 --> 00:14:02,505
So, Tiberius got it completely wrong
and came across as being very aloof

185
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:04,100
because he didn't turn up at all.

186
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:09,066
Then, there were others like Claudius,
who just enjoyed it a bit too much.

187
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:11,217
He used to like
looking at the expressions

188
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:13,616
on the faces of the dying gladiators.

189
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:18,057
Others, also didn't
get involved enough, so Demition

190
00:14:18,147 --> 00:14:21,776
liked to sit in his box
but he spent most of his time chatting

191
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:23,619
to a dwarf in a red cloak.

192
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:28,466
And then there was Nero,
who went too far

193
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:31,220
and actually became
the star of the show himself

194
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:32,706
and performed as a musician.

195
00:14:33,987 --> 00:14:35,579
So for emperors,

196
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:39,297
the games were a time
when you had to get the balance right

197
00:14:39,387 --> 00:14:43,096
between participation
and maintaining your dignity.

198
00:14:45,747 --> 00:14:48,420
But keeping the Romans in Rome,
happy and docile,

199
00:14:48,507 --> 00:14:49,542
(INAUDIBLE)

200
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:52,824
was only one part of the challenge
of running the empire.

201
00:14:56,027 --> 00:15:00,100
What about the 59 million other citizens
and subjects of Rome

202
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:02,747
scattered over its vast territories?

203
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:09,341
To keep them in their place
as compliant, tax-paying units,

204
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:14,098
emperors depended upon the loyalty
and commitment of local elites.

205
00:15:16,307 --> 00:15:20,266
It was they, in thousands of towns,
large and small,

206
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:22,417
who really ran the Roman Empire.

207
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:27,386
Extracting revenues,
building public works

208
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:31,460
and keeping order by imitating
the bread and circuses programme

209
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,344
developed in the capital.

210
00:15:35,347 --> 00:15:38,817
The system was remarkably efficient
and streamlined.

211
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:44,186
The whole of the Empire was administered
by just 1 0,000 of these bureaucrats.

212
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:47,101
Modern Britain has half a million.

213
00:15:51,747 --> 00:15:54,261
To cultivate and maintain their loyalty,

214
00:15:54,347 --> 00:15:58,898
they were granted full citizen rights
and generous tax concessions.

215
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:04,906
And perhaps most importantly
there was the Imperial cult

216
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:08,423
which turned emperors
and their families into gods.

217
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:16,345
Here the Emperor Antoninus ius
is being elevated to the heavens

218
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:18,338
on the wings of an eagle.

219
00:16:21,307 --> 00:16:25,505
In Ephesus in Turkey,
the divine Hadrian had his own temple.

220
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:33,025
And members of Augustus's dynasty
were worshipped here in Nimes in France.

221
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:42,856
This bronze statue behind me
is of the Emperor Claudius,

222
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:45,063
and it comes
from the temple of Augustus,

223
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:47,342
Herculaneum in Southern Italy.

224
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:50,546
But the Imperial cult
wasn't just about religion,

225
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:52,936
it was also about political control.

226
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:56,140
The problem that an emperor had
was how to connect

227
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:59,697
with his millions of subjects
over a huge empire,

228
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:02,745
people who he was never
going to meet personally.

229
00:17:03,227 --> 00:17:06,344
The Imperial cult acted
as a kind of hologram,

230
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:09,938
beaming the emperor
right across his vast empire

231
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:15,024
and allowing him to create some kind of
personal connection with his subjects.

232
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:23,138
But when it came to religion,
the Romans were not fundamentalists.

233
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:26,937
Here at the Temple of Luxor in Egypt,

234
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:31,464
it was perfectly acceptable to worship
the ancient Egyptian gods

235
00:17:31,547 --> 00:17:34,857
alongside the deified emperors
of the Imperial cult.

236
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:45,542
And elsewhere in the Empire,
there was plenty of other evidence

237
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:47,902
for Rome's religious tolerance.

238
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:54,219
We're here in the Bekaa valley
in Lebanon,

239
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,424
what was once Heliopolis,
the City of the Sun.

240
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,058
A little bit of Rome from Rome.

241
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:02,585
Before it was called Heliopolis,

242
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:05,818
this was known
as the Phoenician City of Baalbek.

243
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:08,455
Dedicated to the god, Baal.

244
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:12,456
Alexander Greekified the name.

245
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:17,662
But the Romans, when they took control,
preferred to keep things as they were.

246
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:21,179
Imperial Rome was just not interested
in name changes,

247
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:25,376
preferring instead to add new labels
rather than erasing the old.

248
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:33,702
In spiritual matters,
the Empire was a sponge,

249
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:38,941
absorbing foreign gods as readily
as it had gobbled up foreign territory.

250
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:45,139
This was the Temple of Jupiter.

251
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:50,224
But the Jupiter worshipped here
was also understood to be Baal-Hadad.

252
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:52,104
A local storm deity

253
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:55,736
who had been honoured here for centuries
before the first togas arrived.

254
00:18:56,347 --> 00:19:00,306
The Temple of venus over there
was also the Temple of Astarte,

255
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:02,697
the Phoenician goddess of love.

256
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:05,506
And at the Temple of Bacchus,
the wine god,

257
00:19:05,587 --> 00:19:08,181
it was also possible
to pray to Dionysus,

258
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:10,735
an ancient eastern fertility deity.

259
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:14,027
The Romans were big tent polytheists.

260
00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:17,144
All were welcome
to local and traditional gods.

261
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:19,702
Just as long as they were willing
to offer up

262
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:22,540
a pinch of incense to the Imperial cult.

263
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:30,424
Rome tolerated everything,
except for rebellion, political disorder

264
00:19:30,507 --> 00:19:32,702
and the non-payment of taxes.

265
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:37,665
For a region like this, which had known
the scourge of war in the past,

266
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:40,545
that must have sounded
like a pretty good deal.

267
00:19:49,307 --> 00:19:52,822
But the ironic truth
about the Roman Empire was this.

268
00:19:53,387 --> 00:19:57,460
The further you were from
the toxic centre that Rome was becoming,

269
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:01,706
the more the stability and security
created by the Pax Romana

270
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:03,937
could be enjoyed and exploited.

271
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:11,299
In the second century AD,
where I'm standing now

272
00:20:11,387 --> 00:20:14,220
would have been on the very edge
of the Roman Empire.

273
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:18,505
This way lies Rome, 1 500 miles,

274
00:20:19,147 --> 00:20:21,138
as the Imperial Eagle flies.

275
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:25,745
And this way lies Mesopotamia, ersia,

276
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:28,342
India, China,

277
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:31,503
and the very edges of the known world.

278
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:35,057
When we talk
about the edge of empire,

279
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:37,741
we tend to think
of Hadrian's famous wall,

280
00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:41,945
clambering over the rain-soaked hills
of Cumbria and Northumberland,

281
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:46,225
manned by homesick squaddies
grumbling about their chilblains.

282
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:49,937
Well, here,
there was no wall or chilblains.

283
00:20:50,907 --> 00:20:54,217
This was Palmyra,
the queen of the desert,

284
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:58,976
and it tells a very different story
of what life could be like

285
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:00,898
under the ax Romana.

286
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:08,775
Rome had acquired this desert territory
during the last decades of the Republic.

287
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:14,260
And almyra was first garrisoned
during the reign of Augustus.

288
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:21,460
Even then it was a vital link
in the east-west trade route,

289
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:25,660
providing an essential stopover point

290
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:28,215
between the upper waters
of the Euphrates

291
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:30,059
and the Mediterranean coast.

292
00:21:32,947 --> 00:21:36,257
For the almyrans,
the arrival of the Romans simply meant

293
00:21:36,347 --> 00:21:39,464
that a whole new market opportunity
had opened up.

294
00:21:40,107 --> 00:21:44,658
From the workshops and factories
of Rome, supplies of manufactured goods.

295
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:48,417
From India and the east,
spices and silk.

296
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:49,902
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

297
00:21:49,987 --> 00:21:51,864
Of course,
we've met these people before.

298
00:21:51,947 --> 00:21:55,098
The bronze-age merchants
travelling with their mule trains

299
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:57,098
from Ashur to Anatolia.

300
00:21:57,347 --> 00:22:00,817
The iron-age Phoenicians
crisscrossing the Mediterranean

301
00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:02,306
in their sturdy ships.

302
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:06,700
Well, they're here too, in Palmyra,
the essential middlemen,

303
00:22:06,787 --> 00:22:10,063
stitching together to the political map
of the ancient world

304
00:22:10,147 --> 00:22:12,138
with the thread of trade.

305
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:16,824
And as the Assyrians had their mules,
and the Phoenicians had their ships,

306
00:22:16,907 --> 00:22:20,377
so the Palmyrans had
their favourite mode of transport.

307
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:21,901
The camel.

308
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:25,261
(BELLOWING)

309
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:35,699
By mastering the art of crossing
the desert with their camel trains,

310
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,176
the almyrans were able
to join together

311
00:22:38,267 --> 00:22:40,383
what nature had put asunder.

312
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:54,496
But like all traders,
what the almyrans needed most

313
00:22:54,587 --> 00:22:56,339
was peace and stability.

314
00:22:56,427 --> 00:23:00,181
Reliable supplies of stock
and stable markets

315
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:05,295
so that they could pursue their ultimate
objective of getting rich, quick.

316
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:16,425
This wasn't always easy.

317
00:23:16,507 --> 00:23:20,102
To the immediate east of them,
lay the kingdom of arthia,

318
00:23:20,627 --> 00:23:23,460
a thorn in the side of Rome
for centuries.

319
00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:27,899
Like others before him,

320
00:23:27,987 --> 00:23:29,625
the Emperor Trajan decided to solve

321
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:32,380
Rome's eastern problems
once and for all.

322
00:23:33,387 --> 00:23:35,537
He led his legions into arthia

323
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:38,983
and then beyond,
to the ancient cities of Mesopotamia

324
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:41,656
following the footsteps
of Alexander the Great.

325
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:47,303
Whereas Alexander's victories had
fuelled an appetite for further glory,

326
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:50,665
Trajan came to a rather
different conclusion.

327
00:23:51,427 --> 00:23:55,579
This country is so measurably vast
and separated from Rome

328
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:59,785
by such incalculable distance
we cannot possibly administer it.

329
00:24:00,427 --> 00:24:03,180
He then turned around
and went back west.

330
00:24:04,507 --> 00:24:06,816
That was AD 1 1 7.

331
00:24:07,387 --> 00:24:11,346
And if you wanted to date
the high watermark of the Roman Empire,

332
00:24:11,627 --> 00:24:16,621
then Trajan's, rather world-weary
conclusion, would arguably be it.

333
00:24:21,387 --> 00:24:24,026
Under Trajan's successor, Hadrian,

334
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:28,464
Rome reverted to a policy of peace
with its eastern neighbours.

335
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:34,784
After 500 years of expansion,
Rome finally decided enough was enough.

336
00:24:37,627 --> 00:24:40,778
Fuzzy borders became lines
in the sand,

337
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:44,416
and almyra, on the critical interface
between the Roman

338
00:24:44,507 --> 00:24:48,819
and the non-Roman world
became a free city.

339
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:54,098
And that was when the good times
really began to roll.

340
00:24:55,827 --> 00:25:00,742
Sometime in the 2nd Century AD,
over around a 1 50 years afterwards,

341
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:03,705
the Palmyrans achieved
the perfect formula

342
00:25:03,787 --> 00:25:06,779
in their relationship with Rome.

343
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:10,416
First of all, they were important
because they provided Rome

344
00:25:10,507 --> 00:25:14,341
with something it wanted.
Silks and spices.

345
00:25:14,427 --> 00:25:17,703
And second, there was no
conflict of interest there

346
00:25:17,787 --> 00:25:21,063
because the Palmyrans
were only interested in profits,

347
00:25:21,147 --> 00:25:25,106
whereas Rome, like all empires,
was obsessed with its own destiny.

348
00:25:31,787 --> 00:25:33,698
Finally, and best of all,

349
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:36,824
the alymyrans were far enough away
from Rome

350
00:25:36,907 --> 00:25:39,182
to be left alone to get on with it.

351
00:25:41,147 --> 00:25:44,105
And today we can see the virtues
of being left alone,

352
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:45,905
in the elaborate mausoleums

353
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:49,586
put up by some of the leading families
of almyra,

354
00:25:50,147 --> 00:25:52,820
both above ground and underground.

355
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:57,664
Memorials to their wealth and status,

356
00:25:57,747 --> 00:26:01,217
but also the benefits of being
in the Empire

357
00:26:01,307 --> 00:26:03,343
rather than of the Empire.

358
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:16,939
But it wasn't just merchant princes
who enjoyed the benefits of Empire.

359
00:26:19,907 --> 00:26:23,217
The ancient Greeks always used to say
that the basis

360
00:26:23,307 --> 00:26:27,585
for any successful society was Eunomia,
good order,

361
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:37,136
and that's what you can sense in a set
of remarkable archaeological finds

362
00:26:37,227 --> 00:26:39,695
from some of Rome's Egyptian cities.

363
00:26:40,707 --> 00:26:44,143
The banal blessings
of good order writ large.

364
00:26:50,227 --> 00:26:52,900
As any private eye worth his salt
will tell you

365
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:56,059
what people throw away
is often more revealing

366
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,456
than what they keep and cherish.

367
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:02,460
And it was certainly the case here,
in the Roman City of Antonopoulos

368
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:07,177
are amongst the tonnes of broken
pottery, archaeologist struck gold.

369
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:10,498
Papyri, thousands and thousands of them.

370
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,306
So many that it's going to
take generations of scholars

371
00:27:13,387 --> 00:27:15,537
to decipher and publish them all.

372
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:29,263
This wealth of written material

373
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:32,544
allows us to reconstruct
in minute detail

374
00:27:32,627 --> 00:27:35,824
what life was like here
in the heyday of the Empire.

375
00:27:38,427 --> 00:27:42,420
Most of it is the ancient equivalent
of those mountains of paper

376
00:27:42,507 --> 00:27:45,067
that clog up our lives today.

377
00:27:45,147 --> 00:27:49,538
Bills, tax returns, personal letters,

378
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:52,904
invitations, certificates,

379
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:55,262
contracts, to-do lists.

380
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:59,782
The kind of stuff that's either
too important to throw away

381
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:02,142
or too trivial to be bothered with.

382
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:07,100
In the nearby city of Oxyrhynchus
comes more of the same.

383
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:14,743
This one addresses the serious problem
of donkeys being driven too quickly

384
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:17,341
through the busy streets of the city.

385
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:22,945
And this little note was written
by two friends,

386
00:28:23,027 --> 00:28:28,181
Apium and Epimus, to a school mate
of theirs, Ephroditos.

387
00:28:28,947 --> 00:28:32,178
And it contains
the most extraordinary suggestion.

388
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:35,145
''If you let us bugger you,
if it's okay with you,

389
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:37,058
''we shall stop thrashing you.''

390
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:39,581
And there's even
a helpful little illustration here.

391
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,625
So Aphrodidius knew exactly
what was expected of him.

392
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,660
And then there's this.

393
00:28:46,747 --> 00:28:50,456
This is a letter by Diogenes,
to one of his employees.

394
00:28:51,827 --> 00:28:56,947
''A thousand times I've written to you
to cut down the vines of pohaya.

395
00:28:57,027 --> 00:29:01,066
''But today again I get a letter from you
asking what should be done.

396
00:29:01,147 --> 00:29:02,944
''To which I reply -

397
00:29:03,027 --> 00:29:07,464
''Cut them down. Cut them down.
Cut them down. Cut them down

398
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:11,506
''and cut them down.
There I say it again and again.''

399
00:29:13,507 --> 00:29:16,180
Go on, Diogenes,
why don't you say exactly what you mean?

400
00:29:18,107 --> 00:29:21,895
But there's a twist to this tale
of hotrod donkey riders

401
00:29:21,987 --> 00:29:26,105
smutty teenagers
and slow-witted servants.

402
00:29:26,187 --> 00:29:30,226
And it suggests that the people
of Antonopoulos and Oxyrhynchus

403
00:29:30,307 --> 00:29:32,901
had other things on their minds.

404
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:45,056
And you could say
that these concerns

405
00:29:45,147 --> 00:29:48,617
presaged the decline and fall
of the Roman Empire.

406
00:29:57,747 --> 00:29:59,578
Amongst the charming trivia,

407
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,818
archaeologist also found
this rather different text.

408
00:30:05,467 --> 00:30:08,743
''The Kingdom is inside of you,
and it is outside of you.

409
00:30:08,827 --> 00:30:12,661
''When you come to know yourselves,
when you'll become known

410
00:30:12,747 --> 00:30:16,979
''and you will realise that it is you
who are the sons of the living father.

411
00:30:17,947 --> 00:30:22,020
''But if you will not know yourselves,
you dwell in poverty,

412
00:30:22,107 --> 00:30:24,337
''and it is you who are that poverty.''

413
00:30:33,907 --> 00:30:37,422
These words are from the Apocryphal
Gospel of St Thomas,

414
00:30:37,507 --> 00:30:39,941
from which three extracts
have been found

415
00:30:40,027 --> 00:30:43,099
amongst the bills and the junk mail

416
00:30:43,187 --> 00:30:46,702
and what it shows is
that alongside the everyday concerns

417
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:50,416
about vines and donkeys,
that there were people here

418
00:30:50,507 --> 00:30:53,658
grappling with profound
and unsettling questions

419
00:30:53,747 --> 00:30:58,662
about the meaning of life
and the fate of their immortal souls.

420
00:30:58,747 --> 00:31:02,945
Questions which the Roman Empire,
despite its material wealth

421
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,824
was simply unable to answer.

422
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,745
In many ways,
the Roman Empire represents

423
00:31:14,827 --> 00:31:17,295
the zenith of ancient civilisation.

424
00:31:17,387 --> 00:31:21,699
Its values had taken root
throughout its far flung territories.

425
00:31:21,787 --> 00:31:26,303
But its inability to address
the spiritual anxieties of its subjects

426
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:29,106
would prove to be a fatal flaw.

427
00:31:40,347 --> 00:31:45,580
This weakness would be exposed
and exploited by an obscure Jewish sect

428
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:48,306
that begun in the Roman province
of Judaea

429
00:31:48,387 --> 00:31:52,096
with the execution
of an unorthodox religious leader

430
00:31:52,187 --> 00:31:54,542
called Yeshua Ben Yosef.

431
00:31:58,027 --> 00:31:59,096
(BELL TOLLING)

432
00:32:00,147 --> 00:32:04,379
Christianity would go on to become
the official religion of Rome.

433
00:32:05,307 --> 00:32:08,299
And the major contributor
to its downfall.

434
00:32:15,827 --> 00:32:21,823
The cult's extraordinary growth
began after the Jewish revolt of 66 AD,

435
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:24,947
and the destruction
of the High Temple in Jerusalem

436
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:28,337
by Titus, the son of the Roman Emperor,
vespasian.

437
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,458
This triumphal arch was built
to commemorate

438
00:32:42,547 --> 00:32:45,107
Titus' suppression of the Jews.

439
00:32:45,187 --> 00:32:47,576
And inside it, there are two friezes.

440
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:50,137
On one side, we have the Emperor,

441
00:32:50,227 --> 00:32:52,980
flanked by the winged goddess
of victory in his chariot

442
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:55,183
and surrounded by his troops.

443
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:58,304
And on the other,
we have the spoils of victory.

444
00:32:59,547 --> 00:33:02,744
The most sacred objects
from the temple on the mount.

445
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:06,183
The Menorah
and the silver trumpets amongst them.

446
00:33:07,787 --> 00:33:11,097
So, this arch was as much about issuing
a severe warning

447
00:33:11,187 --> 00:33:13,860
of the dangers
of resisting the ax Romana

448
00:33:13,947 --> 00:33:16,586
as it was about tasting
the sweetness of victory.

449
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:24,137
But what the Romans actually did
was sow the seeds

450
00:33:24,227 --> 00:33:25,740
for their later problems.

451
00:33:28,947 --> 00:33:30,778
After the failed revolt,

452
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:33,859
/ews dispersed
throughout the Mediterranean world

453
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:37,064
carrying with them
the beliefs of Christianity.

454
00:33:38,507 --> 00:33:42,739
These beliefs would put Christians
on a collision course with Rome.

455
00:33:43,907 --> 00:33:48,617
They were fiercely monotheistic
and baulked at the Imperial cult.

456
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:52,416
They made a sharp distinction
between the sacred and the secular.

457
00:33:52,507 --> 00:33:57,262
And they looked forward
to a glorious life after death,

458
00:33:57,347 --> 00:34:01,056
making a mockery
of the Empire's worldly devotion

459
00:34:01,147 --> 00:34:02,819
to the here and now.

460
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:16,537
Christianity initially took root away
from the Imperial centre

461
00:34:16,627 --> 00:34:18,697
in places like Carthage in North Africa.

462
00:34:22,547 --> 00:34:25,584
For the authorities here,
to be a Christian

463
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:29,945
was to be a revolutionary
and a target for persecution.

464
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:34,777
A new word will enter
the religious lexicon.

465
00:34:36,387 --> 00:34:37,536
Martyr.

466
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:44,105
The problem for the Romans
was that for the Christians

467
00:34:44,187 --> 00:34:48,066
martyrdom was a privilege,
not a punishment.

468
00:34:48,147 --> 00:34:51,856
After all it offered a guaranteed pass
into the kingdom of heaven.

469
00:34:56,827 --> 00:35:01,662
In Carthage in 203 AD,
the amphitheatre here

470
00:35:01,747 --> 00:35:05,422
was the site
of a notorious killing of Christians.

471
00:35:08,547 --> 00:35:12,301
Worryingly for the authorities,
one of the female victims,

472
00:35:12,387 --> 00:35:16,062
erpetua, came from one of the cities'
elite families.

473
00:35:20,107 --> 00:35:23,656
erpetua had been arrested
with a group of other Christians

474
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:26,978
including her pregnant servant,
Felicitas.

475
00:35:29,547 --> 00:35:32,220
Both women refused to renounce
their faith,

476
00:35:32,307 --> 00:35:35,538
and both were sentenced to die
in the amphitheatre.

477
00:35:35,627 --> 00:35:38,937
Even though just two days
before the execution,

478
00:35:39,027 --> 00:35:42,383
Felicitas gave birth to a baby daughter.

479
00:35:46,347 --> 00:35:50,625
Felicitas and Perpetua were brought up
naked into the arena

480
00:35:50,707 --> 00:35:52,425
and the crowd immediately
started shouting

481
00:35:52,507 --> 00:35:54,145
for them to be sent down below again.

482
00:35:55,227 --> 00:35:57,343
Not because they wanted
to show them mercy

483
00:35:57,427 --> 00:36:02,057
because they felt squeamish
about Felicitas' lactating breasts

484
00:36:02,147 --> 00:36:04,422
which were dripping milk
all over the arena floor.

485
00:36:06,187 --> 00:36:09,145
When they were sent up again,
they were fully clothed.

486
00:36:09,227 --> 00:36:11,821
They were whipped
and then a wild cow was sent

487
00:36:11,907 --> 00:36:13,659
into the arena to trample them.

488
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,061
But even after that,
they were still alive

489
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:19,866
and swordsmen were sent into the arena
to finish them off.

490
00:36:20,907 --> 00:36:24,058
The swordsman that was sent
in to kill Perpetua,

491
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:27,457
his hands were shaking so much
that she had to hold them

492
00:36:27,547 --> 00:36:28,946
so he could cut her throat.

493
00:36:33,707 --> 00:36:38,098
erpetua had got what she wanted,
a martyr's death,

494
00:36:39,587 --> 00:36:42,385
and this bloody ritual
would be repeated sporadically

495
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:45,300
in amphitheatres
across the Roman Empire,

496
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:46,615
over the next century.

497
00:36:57,227 --> 00:37:00,299
But persecution was never
a coherent policy.

498
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:03,540
And when the Roman authorities
abandoned it,

499
00:37:03,627 --> 00:37:06,619
frustrated martyrs
had to find other ways

500
00:37:06,707 --> 00:37:09,426
to express their rejection
of the Roman world.

501
00:37:13,747 --> 00:37:17,456
If it couldn't be achieved quickly
through the executioner's blade,

502
00:37:17,547 --> 00:37:20,778
salvation would have
to be earned the hard way

503
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:22,858
through extreme asceticism.

504
00:37:26,587 --> 00:37:29,704
This is the world's oldest
Christian monastery

505
00:37:29,787 --> 00:37:31,823
St Anthony's in Egypt.

506
00:37:33,907 --> 00:37:37,661
Anthony was born
into a wealthy Egyptian family

507
00:37:37,747 --> 00:37:39,783
around 250 AD.

508
00:37:40,787 --> 00:37:43,506
At the age of 34,
he decided to renounce

509
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:47,375
his material possessions
and dedicate his life to God.

510
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:52,583
So, he headed into the desert
to live the life of a hermit in a cave.

-Yeah.

I think maybe one thousand

You know that it's like
the way to the heaven.

515

It's a very narrow way
and very tough way

This is the cave of St Anthony
where he used to live here.

521
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:36,581
And I believe that his blessing
is still present inside the cave.

-Just go and have... And enjoy the time.
-Thank you very much, Father Damien.

Okay.

524
00:38:59,627 --> 00:39:03,825
Christianity was particularly attractive
to those who wanted to opt out

525
00:39:03,907 --> 00:39:06,626
from the comfortable certainties
of the imperial system.

526
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:11,300
They wanted spiritual
rather than material enrichment.

527
00:39:11,387 --> 00:39:15,221
For these young men and women,
asceticism offered an escape

528
00:39:15,307 --> 00:39:17,980
from the straitjacket of public service,

with their eyes fervently focussed
on the promise of a world to come

were precisely
the kind of wealthy, educated people

who would have been expected
to take up active roles

in the running and the administration
of the Empire.

546
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:40,462
By dropping out
they sapped the energies of a system

547
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:44,506
that ultimately depended
on the active commitment of its elites

00:40:44,587 --> 00:40:47,260
to keep the machinery of empire
ticking over.

something far more radical

to turn this revolutionary movement

551

This is Constantine.

556
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:29,218
The man who would turn a agan Empire
into a Christian one.

557
00:41:30,227 --> 00:41:34,186
He was a man of action
rather than a man of faith.

558
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:37,179
But even he seems to have been
looking for answers

559
00:41:37,267 --> 00:41:39,735
that his civilisation couldn't supply.

560
00:41:42,307 --> 00:41:44,263
Constantine was actually
quite promiscuous

561
00:41:44,347 --> 00:41:48,784
when it came to one-to-one relationships
with individual gods.

562
00:41:48,867 --> 00:41:50,858
By the time he got to Christianity,

563
00:41:50,947 --> 00:41:55,498
he'd already been through Apollo
and the sun god Sol Invictus.

564
00:41:55,587 --> 00:41:58,624
But his relationship with Christianity
would endure.

565
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:03,744
It was possibly because of
Christianity's monotheistic tendencies

566
00:42:03,827 --> 00:42:07,706
fitted very well with the man
who had ultimately been responsible

567
00:42:07,787 --> 00:42:10,062
for the collapse of the Tetrarchy.

568
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:12,138
One emperor, one god.

569
00:42:16,347 --> 00:42:19,896
The Tetrarchy had involved
the carving up of the Empire

570
00:42:19,987 --> 00:42:21,784
between four different emperors.

571
00:42:25,267 --> 00:42:27,986
It had been created
by the Emperor Diocletian

572
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:30,297
at the end of the 3rd century AD

573
00:42:30,387 --> 00:42:33,777
because the Empire had become too large
and unwieldy

574
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:35,380
for one man to rule.

575
00:42:41,347 --> 00:42:43,417
But after Diocletian's death

576
00:42:43,507 --> 00:42:47,420
the rival emperors,
inevitably, went to war.

577
00:42:48,347 --> 00:42:51,464
This climaxed in 3 1 2 AD

578
00:42:51,547 --> 00:42:54,983
at the battle of the Milvian Bridge
on the outskirts of Rome

579
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:59,945
where Constantine defeated
his rival Maxentius,

580
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:05,580
who drowned in the Tiber.

581
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,181
Christians travelling
with Constantine's army

582
00:43:12,267 --> 00:43:16,180
were quick to attribute the victory,
commemorated on this arch,

583
00:43:16,267 --> 00:43:18,019
to the divine favour of their God.

584
00:43:21,987 --> 00:43:25,980
Constantine, always ready to give a god
the benefit of the doubt,

585
00:43:26,067 --> 00:43:28,058
showed his gratitude a year later,

586
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,536
by passing an edict of toleration

587
00:43:30,627 --> 00:43:34,586
granting Christians freedom of worship
throughout the Empire.

588
00:43:36,787 --> 00:43:41,019
A decade later, when Constantine emerged
as sole emperor,

589
00:43:41,107 --> 00:43:46,704
the obscure Messianic cult from Judaea
really came in from the cold.

590
00:43:55,107 --> 00:43:58,577
Constantine demonstrated his commitment
to Christianity

591
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:00,544
with hard cash.

592
00:44:00,627 --> 00:44:03,585
He endowed a series
of magnificent churches,

593
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:06,340
including Saint eter's Basilica
in Rome,

594
00:44:06,427 --> 00:44:09,419
and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre,
/erusalem.

595
00:44:09,507 --> 00:44:13,625
Which was built on the supposed site
of the Son of God's tomb

596
00:44:13,707 --> 00:44:17,222
on the orders
of Constantine's pious mother, Helena.

597
00:44:18,187 --> 00:44:23,307
These would become new centres
of political as well as spiritual power

598
00:44:23,387 --> 00:44:24,866
in Constantine's empire.

599
00:44:27,027 --> 00:44:30,986
In return for political support
and generous patronage,

600
00:44:31,067 --> 00:44:36,221
Constantine expected one thing
above all from his church..

601
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:40,095
A consistent message
on Christianity's core beliefs.

602
00:44:41,227 --> 00:44:46,665
The Council of Nicaea held in 325 AD
in present day Turkey

603
00:44:47,147 --> 00:44:51,538
was the first and most famous attempt
of the Christian establishment

604
00:44:51,627 --> 00:44:53,265
to get its story straight.

605
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:57,578
As you can see,
there's not much left of the place

606
00:44:57,667 --> 00:45:00,022
where the first Council of Nicaea
was held.

607
00:45:01,187 --> 00:45:04,020
However, although the bricks and mortar
are long gone,

608
00:45:04,107 --> 00:45:07,065
the legacy of the meeting of bishops
that took place here

609
00:45:07,147 --> 00:45:10,105
in 325 AD has endured.

610
00:45:10,187 --> 00:45:14,226
Because it was here that the Rome
of Romulus and the Republic

611
00:45:14,307 --> 00:45:19,017
and Augustus Caesar and the Empire
began to make way for a new Rome.

612
00:45:19,107 --> 00:45:21,382
A Rome of priests, popes

613
00:45:21,467 --> 00:45:23,935
and the Holy Catholic
and Apostolic Church.

614
00:45:30,267 --> 00:45:32,656
Constantine presented the Council

615
00:45:32,747 --> 00:45:35,898
with what seemed
like a reasonable request.

616
00:45:35,987 --> 00:45:37,978
A firm date for Easter

617
00:45:38,067 --> 00:45:41,343
and agreement on the precise nature
of the relationship

618
00:45:41,427 --> 00:45:44,146
that stood at the heart
of Christian faith.

619
00:45:44,227 --> 00:45:48,539
That between the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

620
00:45:49,307 --> 00:45:51,662
Easier asked than answered.

621
00:45:53,267 --> 00:45:57,021
These seats were used
for a much later Council of Nicaea

622
00:45:57,107 --> 00:46:00,019
which was held here
in the Church of Hagia Sophia

623
00:46:00,107 --> 00:46:01,984
centuries after the first one.

624
00:46:02,947 --> 00:46:07,179
But I don't suppose the seating
technology had changed very much.

625
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:08,586
And the point of this

626
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:12,740
is that these seats are incredibly
cramped and uncomfortable.

627
00:46:12,827 --> 00:46:16,422
And every time you sat down
they must have served as an invitation

628
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,179
to come up with a quick compromise.

629
00:46:18,987 --> 00:46:21,785
And that's exactly
what Constantine wanted.

630
00:46:21,867 --> 00:46:23,858
A quick, political fix

631
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:28,782
to what he said were nothing more
than small and trifling matters.

632
00:46:28,867 --> 00:46:32,906
But what he didn't appreciate was that
this was a new type of politics,

633
00:46:32,987 --> 00:46:34,579
the politics of faith.

634
00:46:35,187 --> 00:46:39,544
And in this new political landscape
nothing was small or trifling.

635
00:46:45,307 --> 00:46:47,423
The bishops ended up compromising

636
00:46:47,507 --> 00:46:51,898
on a form of words
familiar to all Christians today.

637
00:46:52,427 --> 00:46:56,022
''We believe in one God,
the Father Almighty,

638
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:59,861
''and in one Lord Jesus Christ,

effectively brought to an end

643
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:24,618
five hundred years of Roman history.

On the 1 1 th of May, 330,

645

Rome was finally eclipsed
as the capital of the Roman Empire.

646
00:47:32,347 --> 00:47:34,622
Of course
there had been contenders before

647
00:47:34,707 --> 00:47:36,618
but this time it was for real.

648
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:41,096
Five hundred miles east of Rome
on the straits of the Bosphorus,

649
00:47:41,187 --> 00:47:44,418
Constantine founded
the city of Constantinople.

650
00:47:44,507 --> 00:47:47,817
And he planned it to be
nothing less than the new Rome.

651
00:47:56,867 --> 00:48:00,257
Constantine based himself
in Constantinople,

652
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:05,262
present day Istanbul,
until he died in 337 AD

653

With just one exception,
Constantine's successors

656
00:48:25,187 --> 00:48:28,145
would follow his example
and be Christians.

657
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:32,057
Their support made the Church
a real power in the land

658
00:48:32,147 --> 00:48:34,820
and towards the end
of the 4th century AD

659
00:48:34,907 --> 00:48:38,741
began to assert its independence
from its imperial patrons.

660
00:48:42,827 --> 00:48:45,261
The main driving force
on the Christians' side

661
00:48:45,347 --> 00:48:47,542
was Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.

662
00:48:47,627 --> 00:48:49,345
A clever and energetic man

663
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,703
who was clearly unfazed
with dealing with emperors.

664
00:48:52,787 --> 00:48:56,336
Before he joined the Church,
Ambrose had had a successful career

665
00:48:56,427 --> 00:48:58,065
as a senator and governor.

666
00:48:58,747 --> 00:49:02,581
Now, Ambrose was firmly of the belief
that it was the Christian church,

667
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:06,746
not the Roman Emperor who was
God's main representative on Earth.

668
00:49:06,867 --> 00:49:10,143
And this position was bound to set him
on a collision course

669
00:49:10,227 --> 00:49:12,422
with emperors who were used
by this time

670
00:49:12,507 --> 00:49:16,420
in intervening in religious affairs
whenever they felt like it.

671
00:49:16,827 --> 00:49:21,139
So, the scene was now set
for a dramatic and very public showdown

672
00:49:21,227 --> 00:49:23,218
here, in Imperial Milan.

673
00:49:25,867 --> 00:49:29,621
It pitted Ambrose
against the Emperor Theodosius,

674
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:33,940
a battle hardened campaigner
but also a pious Christian.

675
00:49:34,707 --> 00:49:39,064
The spark was the massacre
of 7,000 rebellious subjects

676
00:49:39,427 --> 00:49:43,420
under the orders of Theodosius,
in Thessaloniki in Greece.

677
00:49:46,587 --> 00:49:51,377
Many of the victims were Christians
and Ambrose felt compelled to respond.

678
00:49:52,267 --> 00:49:56,021
He banned Theodosius
from the congregation in his cathedral

679
00:49:56,107 --> 00:49:59,895
and threatened him with excommunication
if he didn't repent.

680
00:50:05,027 --> 00:50:06,904
Theodosius took the hint,

681
00:50:06,987 --> 00:50:09,581
and for the next couple of months
the citizens of Milan

682
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:13,023
were treated to the extraordinary
spectacle of their emperor,

683
00:50:13,107 --> 00:50:15,940
the most powerful and feared man
in the Roman world.

684
00:50:16,027 --> 00:50:20,179
Doing the acts of public penance,
stripped of his imperial insignia.

685
00:50:20,547 --> 00:50:22,856
But when eventually,
the chastened emperor

686
00:50:22,947 --> 00:50:25,620
was readmitted back
into the Catholic fold,

687
00:50:25,707 --> 00:50:28,779
Ambrose insisted that he stood
with the congregation,

688
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:32,143
rather than joining the priests
in the sacred sanctuary.

689
00:50:32,227 --> 00:50:37,142
Ambrose had emphatically and literally
put Theodosius in his place.

690
00:50:43,467 --> 00:50:46,743
Ambrose's spectacular humiliation
of the Emperor

691
00:50:46,827 --> 00:50:50,900
impressed the ambitious men
about where real power now lay.

692
00:50:57,547 --> 00:51:01,176
One of these men was a brilliant scholar
called Augustine.

693
00:51:04,707 --> 00:51:08,177
Baptized here in Milan
by Ambrose himself.

694
00:51:15,227 --> 00:51:19,539
Augustine had been born into a fairly
prosperous family in North Africa.

695
00:51:19,627 --> 00:51:21,982
And after a good education in Carthage,

696
00:51:22,067 --> 00:51:25,025
had landed a professorship
here in Milan.

697
00:51:25,107 --> 00:51:28,577
But after being baptized,
he decided to return home

698
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:30,385
and devote himself to God.

699
00:51:31,147 --> 00:51:34,219
This was a decision
that would not only change his life

700
00:51:34,307 --> 00:51:37,504
but also the whole course of
Western Christianity.

701
00:51:47,147 --> 00:51:49,297
Augustine returned to Africa,

702
00:51:49,387 --> 00:51:52,345
intending to follow the example of
St Anthony,

703
00:51:52,427 --> 00:51:54,816
leading a simple monastic life.

704
00:51:58,387 --> 00:52:02,539
But his plans were changed for him
when he visited Hippo Regius,

705
00:52:02,627 --> 00:52:05,460
a port city on the North African coast.

706
00:52:09,707 --> 00:52:11,777
When he worshipped
at the church here,

707
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:13,858
he soon got noticed.

708
00:52:13,947 --> 00:52:17,826
With his classical education
and oratorical skills,

709
00:52:17,907 --> 00:52:21,502
the congregation urged him to stay on,
which he did,

710
00:52:21,587 --> 00:52:24,499
and eventually
he would become their bishop.

711
00:52:27,147 --> 00:52:29,820
Augustine was soon playing
an active part

712
00:52:29,907 --> 00:52:32,023
in the religious battles that raged,

713
00:52:32,707 --> 00:52:37,497
using pulpit and pen
to attack pagans and heretics alike.

714
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,301
He'd been bishop for 1 5 years

715
00:52:44,387 --> 00:52:49,063
when history gave him a controversy
that he could really get his teeth into.

716
00:52:53,067 --> 00:52:57,219
In the late summer of 41 0,
shocking news reached Hippo Regius.

717
00:52:57,547 --> 00:53:00,505
Rome, the founding capital,
the greatest empire

718
00:53:00,587 --> 00:53:02,020
that history had ever known

719
00:53:02,107 --> 00:53:05,224
had fallen to Aleric
and his visigothic army.

720
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,820
Three days of looting followed.

721
00:53:14,907 --> 00:53:18,183
And many of Rome's finest buildings
were destroyed.

722
00:53:19,147 --> 00:53:22,457
The mausoleum at the Great Augustus
was ransacked.

723
00:53:23,507 --> 00:53:25,463
Burial urns were overturned.

724
00:53:25,547 --> 00:53:29,381
And the ashes of Roman Emperors
were scattered on the streets.

725
00:53:34,347 --> 00:53:38,420
Rome may have been stripped
of its pre-eminence by Constantine,

726
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:41,783
but it still retained
a symbolic importance,

727
00:53:41,907 --> 00:53:44,501
and its fall to German barbarians

728
00:53:44,587 --> 00:53:47,659
sent reverberations
throughout the Empire.

729
00:54:00,187 --> 00:54:02,576
In the weeks and months that followed,

730
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:06,626
Hippo filled with traumatised refugees
from Rome.

731
00:54:06,707 --> 00:54:10,097
They wanted to know why the Mother City
had fallen.

732
00:54:10,187 --> 00:54:14,066
Augustine took up his pen
and gave them an answer.

733
00:54:18,227 --> 00:54:22,266
It was a blistering attack
on the myth and mystique of Rome.

734
00:54:22,347 --> 00:54:25,100
Writing a Christian counter history
of the city,

735
00:54:25,187 --> 00:54:28,020
a no-holds-barred, decline and fall,

736
00:54:28,107 --> 00:54:30,143
from the city's virtuous founders

737
00:54:30,227 --> 00:54:35,381
to the decadent, selfish,
materialistic citizens of his own day.

738
00:54:35,467 --> 00:54:39,426
''If Rome fell,'' Augustine argued,
''it was because it deserved to.''

739
00:54:43,307 --> 00:54:47,744
In his coup de grace, Augustine
attacked the very ideals that Rome,

740
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:52,617
and indeed all the great civilisations
of the Ancient World aspired to.

741
00:54:55,387 --> 00:54:58,345
These earthly cities
were doomed to fail

742
00:54:58,427 --> 00:55:01,544
because they were the work
of corrupt mankind.

743
00:55:11,827 --> 00:55:15,945
It took Augustine 1 3 years
to finish his masterpiece,

744
00:55:16,027 --> 00:55:17,460
The City of God.

745
00:55:19,267 --> 00:55:22,065
And for me,
there are a few bleaker assessments

746
00:55:22,147 --> 00:55:24,900
of the futility
of civilisation building.

747
00:55:25,547 --> 00:55:29,938
For Augustine, no purpose or meaning
could be found in the Earthly City.

748
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:32,336
Only the City of God offered these.

749
00:55:32,427 --> 00:55:35,578
And that could only be reached
beyond the grave.

750
00:55:38,307 --> 00:55:40,059
Until that glorious release,

751
00:55:40,147 --> 00:55:42,502
the righteous man
should act like a pilgrim

752
00:55:42,587 --> 00:55:44,578
in the fallen world of mankind.

753
00:55:45,707 --> 00:55:48,062
Taking advantage of
the peace and security

754
00:55:48,147 --> 00:55:49,978
that civilisation offered,

755
00:55:50,067 --> 00:55:54,424
but without ever mistaking it
for anything substantial or enduring.

756
00:55:55,627 --> 00:55:57,902
The good man was just passing through

757
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:00,262
in the great technological, political,

758
00:56:00,347 --> 00:56:02,861
and cultural achievements
of civilisation

759
00:56:02,947 --> 00:56:07,463
were mere stepping stones
to the eternal glory of the City of God.

760
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,816
(MUEZZIN CALLING)

761
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:47,862
It's been 1 500 years now,

762
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:50,939
since the City of God
took on the City of Man.

763
00:56:51,227 --> 00:56:54,344
And in that time,
other prophets from other religions

764
00:56:54,427 --> 00:56:56,463
have added their voices of criticism.

765
00:56:57,307 --> 00:57:00,060
Despite its manifold
and serial failures,

766
00:57:00,147 --> 00:57:02,342
the City of Man has endured.

767
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,465
Elaborate schemes for political reform,

768
00:57:07,547 --> 00:57:10,380
social justice or national greatness

769
00:57:10,467 --> 00:57:14,016
have been tried and tested,
often to destruction.

770
00:57:20,227 --> 00:57:21,899
And in the darkest days,

771
00:57:21,987 --> 00:57:24,899
many of which have fallen
in our own times,

772
00:57:24,987 --> 00:57:28,821
the very idea of civilisation
has been called into question.

773
00:57:30,427 --> 00:57:34,261
But despite all the calamities,
crises, and dead-ends,

774
00:57:34,347 --> 00:57:36,338
we have returned again and again

775
00:57:36,427 --> 00:57:39,544
to the possibilities offered
by the City of Man.

776
00:57:42,387 --> 00:57:44,821
Hoping to get it right next time.

777
00:57:51,027 --> 00:57:53,587
There's no going back to
the comfortable securities

778
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:56,101
of family, kin, and tribe.

779
00:57:56,187 --> 00:57:59,145
Civilisation has transformed us
into a species

780
00:57:59,227 --> 00:58:02,776
which for better or worse
chooses to live with strangers.

781
00:58:02,867 --> 00:58:04,744
And we need to keep on trying
to find ways

782
00:58:04,827 --> 00:58:07,387
of making that unlikely choice work.

783
00:58:08,347 --> 00:58:10,463
Personally, I'm optimistic.

784
00:58:10,667 --> 00:58:15,900
Homo sapiens, they say, has been
around for at least 1 60,000 years.

785
00:58:15,987 --> 00:58:18,581
The City, for less than 6000.

786
00:58:19,067 --> 00:58:20,705
So it's early days yet,

787
00:58:20,787 --> 00:58:23,938
we must keep the faith
and try and make it work.
