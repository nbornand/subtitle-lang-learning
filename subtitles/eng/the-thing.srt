00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,295
Your move: Bishop to knight four.

3
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:22,841
My move: Knight to rook three.

4
00:05:22,946 --> 00:05:27,222
Poor baby, you're startin'
to lose it, aren't ya?

5
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,732
Your move: King to rook one.

6
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:37,862
My move: Rook to knight six.

7
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:41,617
Checkmate. Checkmate.

8
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:47,771
You cheatin' bitch.

9
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:53,798
Childs, what's he doin'?

10
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:56,093
Circlin' the camp.

11
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:58,075
Who is he?

12
00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:01,517
- Said Norge or something on the side.
- That's Norwegian.

13
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,252
- George, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

14
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:10,547
Yeah. What's goin' on
down there?

15
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:35,060
Watch it!

16
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:56,964
Easy.

17
00:09:59,572 --> 00:10:02,180
Easy. Easy.

18
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:04,162
Easy. Yes.

19
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:18,348
First goddamn week
of winter.

20
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:33,785
Oh, come on. Four stitches.
Barely grazed ya.

21
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,810
What were they doing
flying that low,

22
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:41,296
- shooting at a dog, at us?
- Hmm, stir-crazy,

23
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,799
cabin fever, who knows?

24
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:48,180
U.S. Number 31, calling McMurdo.
Come in, over.

25
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:54,960
U.S. Number 31, calling McMurdo,
urgent! Come in, over.

26
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,402
Great.

27
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:01,010
- Come on, come on.
- Nobody!

28
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:05,182
Nobody. Get ahold of somebody. Get ahold
of anybody! We gotta report this mess!

29
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:08,625
Look, I haven't been able
to reach shit in two weeks!

30
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:11,962
I doubt if anybody's talked to anybody
on this entire continent,

31
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:14,049
and you want me
to reach somebody!

32
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:27,713
Maybe we at war with Norway.

33
00:11:31,677 --> 00:11:37,309
I was wondering when El Capitan was
gonna get a chance to use his popgun.

34
00:11:41,377 --> 00:11:44,820
- How long they been stationed there?
- It says here only eight weeks.

35
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:48,053
- That's not long
enough for guys to go bonkers.
- Bullshit, Bwana.

36
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:50,557
Five minutes is enough
to put a man over down here.

37
00:11:50,661 --> 00:11:52,851
- Damn straight.
- I mean, look at Palmer.

38
00:11:52,956 --> 00:11:55,668
He been the way he is
since the first day.

39
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:58,484
- How many in their party?
- They started with ten.

40
00:11:58,588 --> 00:12:01,926
- There'd be eight others left.
- How do we know?

41
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:05,368
Guys as crazy as that could have
done a lot of damage to their
own before they got to us.

42
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:08,289
- Nothing we can do.
- Oh, yes there is. I want to go up.

43
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:10,271
- In this weather?
- Bennings?

44
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:14,443
- Winds are gonna let up a tad
next couple of hours.
- A tad?

45
00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:18,511
Can't condone it much myself,
but it is a short haul.

46
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:21,536
An hour there,
an hour back.

47
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:26,543
- Shit, Doc, I'll give you
the lift. No problem.
- Forget it, Palmer.

48
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,047
Thanks for thinkin'
about it though.

49
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,514
Loaded with kerosene.
I count 15 cans.

50
00:12:35,618 --> 00:12:38,747
- MacReady!
- Mac, get your gear on.

51
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:54,289
- It may not clear up for a week,
and we're the closest to 'em.
- It's all right by me, Doc.

52
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:58,670
- I'm just letting you know
we're taking a chance.
- Quit griping, MacReady.

53
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:02,947
If we get caught in a white-out, you can
scratch one doctor and one pilot.

54
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:05,763
This is real thin. It'll clear
as soon as you get up.

55
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:10,457
It's up to you, Mac.

56
00:13:10,561 --> 00:13:14,212
If you don't wanna fly,
we don't fly.

57
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:16,820
- You really wanna save
those crazy Swedes, huh?
- Norwegians.

58
00:13:16,924 --> 00:13:18,802
- Which way, Doc?
- Southwest.

59
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:21,097
You have to read the map
'cause I'm gonna be busy.

60
00:13:28,502 --> 00:13:32,779
Mac's really taking it up, huh?

61
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:35,804
He knows what he's doing.

62
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:41,831
Nauls, will you turn that crap down?
I'm trying to get some sleep.
I was shot today.

63
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:45,691
- Oui, Bwana. Will do.
- ? Very superstitious?

64
00:14:46,838 --> 00:14:49,446
? Writing's on the wall?

65
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:55,392
? Very superstitious?

66
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:13,079
Anybody there?

67
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:15,061
Hey, Sweden?

68
00:17:15,165 --> 00:17:18,086
They're not Swedish, Mac,
they're Norwegian.

69
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:42,576
Mac!

70
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,692
My God! What the hell
happened here?

71
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:26,386
Come on, Doc.

72
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:06,023
Portable video unit.

73
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:08,943
- Anything?
- It's all in Norwegian.

74
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:18,540
- What are ya doin', Doc?
- It could be important work.
I wanna take it back with us.

75
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:21,565
It's gettin' late.
Let's hurry it up.

76
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:23,755
I'll check out
the last few rooms.

77
00:20:42,218 --> 00:20:45,660
Hey, Copper, come here!

78
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,139
Maybe they found a fossil, the remains
of some animal buried in the ice,

79
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:34,164
- and they chopped it out.
- But where is it? Look at this.

80
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,583
What is that?

81
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:56,381
Is that a man
in there or something?

82
00:21:56,486 --> 00:22:01,493
Whatever it is,
they burned it up in a hurry.

83
00:22:01,597 --> 00:22:04,518
Help me find a shovel, Doc.

84
00:22:59,905 --> 00:23:05,017
- We found this.
- Jesus Christ!

85
00:23:29,216 --> 00:23:32,867
Blair, I'd like you
to start an autopsy right away.

86
00:24:33,783 --> 00:24:36,600
- Did you reach anybody yet?
- Reach anybody?

87
00:24:36,704 --> 00:24:38,790
We're a thousand miles
from nowhere, man,

88
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,502
and it's gonna get a hell of
a lot worse before it gets any better!

89
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:44,318
Well, stick to it,
Windows, stick to it.

90
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:52,767
Nothin' wrong with this Norwegian,
physiologically anyway.

91
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:57,566
- No drugs, no alcohol, nothin'.
- Hmm.

92
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,182
Well, what we got here
is what appears to be, anyway,

93
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:26,250
a normal set of internal organs.

94
00:25:26,355 --> 00:25:29,171
Heart,

95
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:32,300
lungs, kidneys, liver,

96
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,282
intestines.

97
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:40,124
Seem to be normal.

98
00:25:57,647 --> 00:26:01,194
...one, door number two
and door number three.

99
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:05,679
I think that Dawn Screen here
has got the most to trade in.
I went to you first.

100
00:26:05,783 --> 00:26:08,391
You brought your friend, Anna.
You've been consulting Anna
all through the show.

101
00:26:08,496 --> 00:26:12,355
- You may as well consult her
one more time.
- I know how this one ends.

102
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:51,471
Clark, will you put this mutt
with the others where it belongs?

103
00:26:55,017 --> 00:26:56,582
Yeah, okay.

104
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:18,487
Go ahead.

105
00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:24,954
Go ahead.
What are you waiting for?

106
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:18,002
I don't know
what the hell's in there.

107
00:30:18,106 --> 00:30:21,131
- It's weird and pissed off,
whatever it is.
- Bennings, go get Childs.

108
00:30:21,235 --> 00:30:23,635
What is this? What's goin' on?

109
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,242
- Hey, Palmer, what is this?
- I don't know.

110
00:30:26,347 --> 00:30:28,328
Childs!
Mac wants the flamethrower!

111
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:30,310
- Mac wants the what?
- That's what he said!

112
00:30:30,415 --> 00:30:32,501
- Now, move!
- Damn it!

113
00:30:45,331 --> 00:30:47,521
- Stand back.
- Mac, what is it?

114
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:38,215
No! No! God!

115
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,136
- Don't! Don't! No!
- Get back! Get back!

116
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:09,716
Get your ass over here! Burn it!

117
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:15,975
Damn it, Childs,
torch it!

118
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:40,361
Oh, my God.

119
00:33:45,993 --> 00:33:50,270
Oh! Ohh!

120
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,780
Look. Son of a bitch.

121
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,973
What we're talking
about here is an organism...

122
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:21,250
that imitates other life-forms,
and it imitates them perfectly.

123
00:34:21,354 --> 00:34:23,232
When this thing
attacked our dogs,

124
00:34:23,336 --> 00:34:26,674
it tried to digest 'em,
absorb them.

125
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:31,055
And in the process shape
its own cells to imitate them.

126
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:37,418
This, for instance.
That's not dog.

127
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:40,755
It's imitation.

128
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,511
We got to it before
it had time to finish.

129
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,014
Finish what?

130
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:50,248
Finish imitating these dogs.

131
00:34:56,923 --> 00:35:01,200
Easy. Easy. Good.

132
00:35:03,703 --> 00:35:05,998
Easy. Easy.

133
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:12,882
- Clark?
- Yeah?

134
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:16,220
Did you notice anything strange
about the dog, anything at all?

135
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:18,515
Strange? No.

136
00:35:20,497 --> 00:35:22,375
What was the dog doing
in the rec room?

137
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:24,461
I don't know.

138
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:27,173
He was just wandering
around camp all day.

139
00:35:29,572 --> 00:35:33,536
Are you sayin' to me the dog wasn't
put in the kennel until last night?

140
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,064
- Right.
- How long were you alone with that dog?

141
00:35:39,168 --> 00:35:44,801
I don't know, an hour,
hour and a half maybe.

142
00:35:44,905 --> 00:35:47,617
What the hell you lookin'
at me like that for?

143
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:54,189
- I don't know.
- What?

144
00:35:54,293 --> 00:35:58,778
I don't know.
It's probably nothin'.

145
00:35:58,883 --> 00:36:02,325
It's nothin' at all.

146
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:14,216
How much more
of this crap is there?

147
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,640
- Oh, nine hours I'd say.
- We can't learn anything from this.

148
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,726
Guess not.

149
00:36:31,948 --> 00:36:33,826
Where'd they take
these shots?

150
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,060
Seems like they were spending
a lot of their time...

151
00:36:37,164 --> 00:36:40,085
in a little place northeast of
their camp about five or six miles.

152
00:36:40,189 --> 00:36:43,318
What's that?

153
00:36:43,422 --> 00:36:46,343
It looks like something
buried under the ice.

154
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:55,105
And look at that,
they're planting thermite charges.

155
00:36:55,209 --> 00:37:00,112
Whatever it was, it was bigger
than the block of ice you found.

156
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:09,813
Here.

157
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:13,046
This is it, the place where
they were spending most of their time.

158
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,384
- Pretty nasty out. 35 knots.
- Screw it. I'm gonna go up anyway.

159
00:37:39,228 --> 00:37:42,253
Half a mile due east.

160
00:39:20,303 --> 00:39:24,788
Jesus! How long you figure
this has been in the ice?

161
00:39:24,892 --> 00:39:28,647
Well, the backscatter effect's
been bringin' things up...

162
00:39:28,752 --> 00:39:31,359
from way down around here
for a long time.

163
00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:33,863
I'd say... I'd say
the ice it's buried in...

164
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:37,722
is 100,000 years old
at least.

165
00:39:39,495 --> 00:39:42,625
- And those Norwegians blew it up.
- Yeah.

166
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,561
I don't know.

167
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:16,942
Thousands of years ago
it crashes and this thing...

168
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:21,219
gets thrown out or crawls out
and it ends up freezing in the ice.

169
00:40:21,323 --> 00:40:25,913
- I just cannot believe
any of this voodoo bullshit.
- Childs,

170
00:40:26,017 --> 00:40:28,416
happens all the time, man.

171
00:40:28,521 --> 00:40:31,024
They're fallin'
out of the skies like flies.

172
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,632
Government knows all about it.
Right, Mac?

173
00:40:33,736 --> 00:40:37,595
- Do you believe any of this
voodoo bullshit, Blair?
- Childs?

174
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,455
Childs, Chariots Of The Gods, man.

175
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:43,750
They practically
own South America.

176
00:40:43,854 --> 00:40:45,940
I mean, they taught the Incas
everything they know.

177
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,328
So, come on now, MacReady.

178
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:57,414
The Norwegians
get ahold of this...

179
00:40:57,518 --> 00:41:00,022
- and they dig it up out of the ice.
- Yes, Garry, they dig it up,

180
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:02,421
they cart it back,
it gets thawed out,

181
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:04,611
wakes up, probably not
in the best of moods.

182
00:41:04,716 --> 00:41:06,906
- I don't know...
- Which one of you disrespectful men...

183
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:12,017
been tossin' his dirty drawers
in the kitchen trash can, huh?

184
00:41:12,122 --> 00:41:14,729
From now on, I want my kitchen clean,
all right? Germ free!

185
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:17,963
Now, how's this motherfucker wake up
after thousands of years in the ice?

186
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:20,884
- And how can it look like a dog?
- I don't know how.

187
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:23,283
'Cause it's different
than us, see.

188
00:41:23,387 --> 00:41:27,976
'Cause it's from outer space.
What do you want from me? Ask him.

189
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,983
You buy any of this, Blair?

190
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:38,467
Mac, we're movin' those things
out of the lab into the storeroom.

191
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:41,387
Can you come
get your stuff?

192
00:43:41,492 --> 00:43:44,412
Be there in a minute, Doc.

193
00:44:00,476 --> 00:44:02,562
Through the door.

194
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,299
Right over there.
Right over there.

195
00:44:10,907 --> 00:44:13,932
Sorry, Mac. You have
to move your stuff...

196
00:44:14,036 --> 00:44:17,478
Doc says we gotta stash 'em
in here and lock 'em up.

197
00:44:17,582 --> 00:44:20,294
- I have to talk to you.
- I'm tired of talking, Fuchs.

198
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:22,276
I just want to get up
to my shack and get drunk.

199
00:44:22,381 --> 00:44:25,927
- Mac, it's important.
- What is it?

200
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:28,639
- Outside.
- It's 40 below outside.

201
00:44:28,743 --> 00:44:31,664
In the Thiokol.
Please, Mac.

202
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,666
We ought to just burn these things.

203
00:44:48,771 --> 00:44:51,378
Can't burn the find
of the century.

204
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:55,029
That's gonna win somebody
the Nobel Prize.

205
00:45:07,129 --> 00:45:09,007
You got the keys?

206
00:45:09,111 --> 00:45:12,449
Get 'em from Garry.
I want to get some stuff out of here.

207
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:48,540
There's something wrong
with Blair.

208
00:45:48,644 --> 00:45:51,043
He's locked in his room
and won't answer the door.

209
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:55,841
- I took one of his notebooks
from the lab. Listen.
- Yeah?

210
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:00,639
"It could have imitated a million
life-forms on a million planets.

211
00:46:00,744 --> 00:46:03,038
It could change into any one
of them at any time.

212
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:05,542
- Now it wants life-forms on Earth..."
- It's gettin' cold,

213
00:46:05,646 --> 00:46:08,045
- and I haven't slept in two days.
- Wait a minute, Mac.

214
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:11,905
"It needs to be alone
and in close proximity with
the life-form to be absorbed.

215
00:46:12,009 --> 00:46:14,930
- The chameleon strikes in the dark."
- Is Blair cracking up?

216
00:46:15,034 --> 00:46:18,580
Damn it, MacReady.
"There's still cellular activity
in these burned remains.

217
00:46:18,685 --> 00:46:21,918
They're not dead yet."

218
00:46:31,202 --> 00:46:34,227
Let's go, Bennings.
I gotta get some sleep.

219
00:46:52,689 --> 00:46:56,340
Holy shit.

220
00:47:01,034 --> 00:47:02,912
Go get the doc.

221
00:47:03,016 --> 00:47:07,501
- I'll get Garry.
We'll meet in Blair's room.
- All right.

222
00:47:12,404 --> 00:47:14,281
It's Bennings!

223
00:47:24,712 --> 00:47:28,572
Bennings was right there,
Mac! I swear it had ahold of him!

224
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:43,279
- Windows, get back!
Keep away from him!
- Don't touch him!

225
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:48,807
Get back!
Stay back!

226
00:47:51,937 --> 00:47:53,814
It isn't Bennings!

227
00:48:27,193 --> 00:48:30,427
- My God! What was happening to him?
- If it had time to finish,

228
00:48:30,531 --> 00:48:32,930
it would have looked and sounded
and acted just like Bennings!

229
00:48:33,034 --> 00:48:36,268
- I don't know what you're saying.
- That was one of those things,

230
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:39,606
trying to imitate him, Garry.

231
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:46,282
- Come on.
- MacReady, I've known Bennings
for ten years.

232
00:48:46,386 --> 00:48:48,368
He's my friend.

233
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:51,184
We gotta burn
the rest of them.

234
00:49:25,189 --> 00:49:27,171
All right, step back.

235
00:49:52,726 --> 00:49:54,917
You sure that's
all of 'em?

236
00:49:55,021 --> 00:49:57,524
We cleaned out
the storehouse, the lab.

237
00:49:57,629 --> 00:50:00,028
There is nothing left.

238
00:50:00,132 --> 00:50:02,010
Where's Blair?

239
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,819
I can't find Blair.

240
00:50:45,924 --> 00:50:47,905
Where's everybody else?

241
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:50,096
Windows is in the radio room
still trying to get through.

242
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,599
Everyone else is
in the rec room.

243
00:50:52,704 --> 00:50:55,311
You go on.
I'll be in in a minute.

244
00:51:18,468 --> 00:51:20,971
Blair?

245
00:51:21,076 --> 00:51:22,953
Blair?

246
00:52:17,298 --> 00:52:20,636
Don't come in here!
I got a gun! I got an ax!

247
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,391
Don't, you son of a bitch!
Don't come in here! You understand me?

248
00:52:24,495 --> 00:52:27,520
- He's got a gun, Mac!
- Anybody interferes, I'll kill 'im!

249
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:29,502
Jesus!

250
00:52:29,606 --> 00:52:33,049
He smashed up some
of the chopper pretty good.

251
00:52:33,153 --> 00:52:36,386
Childs, go see
if he got to the tractor.

252
00:52:36,491 --> 00:52:41,498
Nobody gets in
and out of here! Nobody!

253
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:50,990
You guys think I'm crazy!
Well, that's fine!

254
00:52:51,094 --> 00:52:55,058
Most of ya don't know
what's going on around here!

255
00:52:55,162 --> 00:52:59,021
But I'm damn well sure
some of you do!

256
00:52:59,126 --> 00:53:01,838
Christ!

257
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:07,888
He got most of the chopper
and the tractor, and he's
killed the rest of the dogs.

258
00:53:11,643 --> 00:53:14,668
Garry, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

259
00:53:14,772 --> 00:53:17,797
All right, Childs,
go around to the map room door.

260
00:53:17,901 --> 00:53:19,779
- Talk to him.
- Okay.

261
00:53:19,883 --> 00:53:21,865
Go on.

262
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:23,743
Norris, get a table from the lab.

263
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:29,584
Do you think that thing
wanted to be an animal?

264
00:53:29,688 --> 00:53:32,817
No dogs make it a thousand
miles through the cold.

265
00:53:35,738 --> 00:53:39,076
No, you don't understand!

266
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,266
That thing wanted to be us!

267
00:53:41,371 --> 00:53:46,899
A cell gets out, it could imitate
everything on the face of the earth!

268
00:53:47,003 --> 00:53:49,507
- And nothing could stop it!
- Okay, Blair.

269
00:53:49,611 --> 00:53:52,949
Come on now, you don't want
to hurt anybody.

270
00:53:53,053 --> 00:53:56,078
I'll kill you!

271
00:54:21,112 --> 00:54:24,972
Good shot, MacReady.
Excuse me.

272
00:54:25,076 --> 00:54:28,623
- All right, bring him up. Lift him up.
- Yeah.

273
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:31,126
Okay. Okay.

274
00:54:47,294 --> 00:54:49,171
Come on, Blair.

275
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:57,412
- What about your shack, MacReady?
- I don't want him in my shack.

276
00:54:57,516 --> 00:54:59,498
We'll lock him
in the toolshed.

277
00:55:03,879 --> 00:55:05,757
Why am I in here?

278
00:55:05,861 --> 00:55:10,033
For your own protection,
Blair... and ours.

279
00:55:22,133 --> 00:55:24,115
How you doin', old boy?

280
00:55:27,661 --> 00:55:30,895
I don't know who to trust.

281
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:34,754
I know what you mean, Blair.

282
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:37,884
Trust is a tough thing
to come by these days.

283
00:55:40,283 --> 00:55:44,038
Tell you what? Why don't you just
trust in the Lord?

284
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:47,271
Watch Clark.

285
00:55:47,376 --> 00:55:49,358
What?

286
00:55:50,505 --> 00:55:53,947
I said, "Watch Clark."

287
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:57,285
And watch him close,
do you hear me?

288
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,895
Now the radio's gone.

289
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:20,129
- So are the choppers.
- We're completely cut off.

290
00:56:20,233 --> 00:56:23,779
All we can do now is hole up 'til
spring and wait for the rescue team.

291
00:56:23,884 --> 00:56:28,265
No, we don't wait. Somebody in
this camp ain't what he appears.

292
00:56:28,369 --> 00:56:31,811
Right now that may be one or two of us.
By spring it could be all of us.

293
00:56:31,915 --> 00:56:35,253
So how do we know
who's human?

294
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:38,278
If I was an imitation...
a perfect imitation...

295
00:56:38,383 --> 00:56:41,929
how would you know
if it was really me?

296
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,231
Is there some kind
of test, Doc?

297
00:56:49,335 --> 00:56:51,421
Well, yeah... possibly.

298
00:56:51,526 --> 00:56:55,072
- I've been thinking
about a blood serum test.
- What's that?

299
00:56:55,176 --> 00:56:57,784
We could take a sample
of each person's blood.

300
00:56:57,888 --> 00:57:00,600
We could mix it
with uncontaminated blood.

301
00:57:00,705 --> 00:57:03,312
I suppose if there's a reaction,
we'd know who isn't human.

302
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:05,294
We've got whole blood
in storage.

303
00:57:05,399 --> 00:57:08,215
Here, start working on it.

304
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,301
Keep an eye on Clark.

305
00:57:10,405 --> 00:57:12,804
He was close to that dog.

306
00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:15,829
Yeah. Yeah.

307
00:57:19,272 --> 00:57:22,818
Mac, we need Blair's help.
He's the only one...

308
00:57:22,922 --> 00:57:25,322
- who knows what this
organism is capable of.
- He's too far gone, Fuchs.

309
00:57:25,426 --> 00:57:29,181
But get the rest of his notebooks
and start going through them.

310
00:57:41,385 --> 00:57:45,349
Garry! Hey, you guys, come here!

311
00:57:45,453 --> 00:57:47,331
What?

312
00:57:47,435 --> 00:57:50,356
- Somebody got to the blood!
- What?

313
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,650
- Where's Clark?
- Right here.

314
00:57:52,755 --> 00:57:55,467
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Was this broken into?

315
00:57:55,571 --> 00:57:57,449
No, the lock is undamaged.

316
00:57:57,553 --> 00:58:00,682
- Somebody opened it,
closed it, then locked it.
- Great.

317
00:58:00,786 --> 00:58:03,290
Who's got access to it?

318
00:58:07,462 --> 00:58:09,653
I guess I'm the only one.

319
00:58:09,757 --> 00:58:12,991
And I got the only key.

320
00:58:15,494 --> 00:58:17,893
Would that test
have worked, Doc?

321
00:58:17,997 --> 00:58:21,022
- Oh, I think so, yes.
- Somebody else sure as hell thought so.

322
00:58:21,127 --> 00:58:24,777
Well, who else could
have used that key?

323
00:58:24,882 --> 00:58:27,907
Nobody! I just give it
to Copper whenever he needs it!

324
00:58:28,011 --> 00:58:31,766
- Could anybody have gotten
it from you, Doc?
- I don't see how.

325
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,957
As soon as I'm finished,
I return it right away.

326
00:58:36,877 --> 00:58:39,068
Great.

327
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:43,136
- When was the last time you used it?
- A day or so ago.

328
00:58:45,118 --> 00:58:47,308
I suppose somebody could
have lifted it off me...

329
00:58:47,412 --> 00:58:50,646
Oh, come on! That key ring
is always hooked to your belt.

330
00:58:52,106 --> 00:58:53,567
Accusing everybody...

331
00:58:54,505 --> 00:58:56,905
Stop it now! It ain't worth it!

332
00:58:57,009 --> 00:58:59,930
- Copper's the only one
who's got any business with it.
- Wait a minute!

333
00:59:00,034 --> 00:59:02,537
- You've been in here
on several occasions!
- Doc thought of the test.

334
00:59:02,642 --> 00:59:05,666
- That clears him? Bullshit!
- Why would he take...

335
00:59:05,771 --> 00:59:07,857
- Shut up, man!
- Windows!
- Windows!

336
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:23,712
Put that down.

337
00:59:23,816 --> 00:59:27,884
- No.
- I'll put this right through your head.

338
00:59:27,989 --> 00:59:31,326
You guys gonna listen to Garry,
let him give the orders?

339
00:59:31,431 --> 00:59:33,830
He could be
one of those things!

340
00:59:33,934 --> 00:59:37,585
Windows, wait a minute.
Just take it easy.

341
00:59:37,689 --> 00:59:39,880
Put the gun down.
Put it down.

342
00:59:39,984 --> 00:59:42,592
- Garry, you don't want to hurt anybody.
- Get back.

343
00:59:42,696 --> 00:59:45,408
On the floor.

344
00:59:58,447 --> 01:00:01,889
It's on the floor.

345
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:10,546
I don't know about Copper,

346
01:00:10,651 --> 01:00:13,884
but I give you my word,
I did not go near that blood.

347
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:26,193
But I guess you'll all
feel a little easier...

348
01:00:26,297 --> 01:00:29,531
if somebody else
was in charge.

349
01:00:29,635 --> 01:00:33,599
Norris, I can't see
anybody objecting to you.

350
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,753
I'm sorry, fellas,
but I-I-I'm not up to it.

351
01:00:39,857 --> 01:00:43,404
- I'll take it.
- Like hell you will.

352
01:00:43,508 --> 01:00:47,889
It should be somebody a little
more even-tempered, Childs.

353
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:59,572
All right.

354
01:01:21,268 --> 01:01:25,023
I know I'm human.

355
01:01:27,005 --> 01:01:30,760
And if you were all these things,
then you'd just attack me right now.

356
01:01:30,864 --> 01:01:33,576
So some of you
are still human.

357
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,767
This thing doesn't want
to show itself.

358
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:39,626
It wants to hide
inside an imitation.

359
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,921
It'll fight if it has to,

360
01:01:42,025 --> 01:01:45,676
but it's vulnerable out in the open.

361
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:48,388
If it takes us over,

362
01:01:48,492 --> 01:01:52,352
then it has no more enemies,

363
01:01:52,456 --> 01:01:54,438
nobody left to kill it.

364
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:57,671
And then it's won.

365
01:02:00,279 --> 01:02:03,408
There's a storm
hitting us in six hours.

366
01:02:03,513 --> 01:02:06,538
We're gonna find out
who's who.

367
01:02:06,642 --> 01:02:10,710
All right, Doc, Garry and Clark move
over there away from the others.

368
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:27,191
Norris, you and Childs shoot 'em up with
morphine. Tie 'em down and watch 'em.

369
01:02:27,295 --> 01:02:29,590
- Fuchs, you start workin' on a new test.
- I need Doc's help.

370
01:02:29,694 --> 01:02:31,885
Yeah, you don't want
to drug me.

371
01:02:31,989 --> 01:02:34,805
Mac, I'm not a prisoner!

372
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,858
Here, let me do it. You're gonna
break the needle in my arm.

373
01:02:57,962 --> 01:03:01,404
No, Doc. He's doin' a real fine job.

374
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:12,878
I'm gonna hide this tape
when I'm finished.

375
01:03:12,982 --> 01:03:17,259
If none of us make it, at least
there'll be some kind of record.

376
01:03:17,363 --> 01:03:21,431
Storm's been hitting us
hard now for 48 hours.

377
01:03:21,536 --> 01:03:23,935
We still have
nothing to go on.

378
01:03:35,513 --> 01:03:37,495
One other thing.

379
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:42,606
I think it rips through your clothes
when it takes you over.

380
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:47,091
Windows found some shredded long johns,
but the name tag was missing.

381
01:03:47,196 --> 01:03:51,055
They could be anybody's.

382
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:54,914
Nobody...

383
01:03:55,019 --> 01:03:58,357
Nobody trusts anybody now.

384
01:03:58,461 --> 01:04:01,069
And we're all very tired.

385
01:04:08,475 --> 01:04:10,456
Nobody trusts anybody now.

386
01:04:14,524 --> 01:04:17,132
There's nothing else I can do.

387
01:04:17,236 --> 01:04:19,427
Just wait.

388
01:04:22,243 --> 01:04:26,624
R.J. MacReady, helicopter pilot,
U.S. Outpost Number 31.

389
01:04:41,227 --> 01:04:43,105
You come up
with anything yet?

390
01:04:43,209 --> 01:04:45,713
One or two ideas.

391
01:04:49,259 --> 01:04:51,345
But, MacReady,
I've been thinking.

392
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:55,831
If a small particle of this thing is
enough to take over an entire organism,

393
01:04:55,935 --> 01:04:57,813
then everyone should
prepare their own meals.

394
01:04:57,917 --> 01:05:00,733
I suggest we only
eat out of cans.

395
01:05:01,881 --> 01:05:03,445
All right.

396
01:05:36,928 --> 01:05:39,745
Who's that?

397
01:06:15,418 --> 01:06:17,922
Anybody see Fuchs?

398
01:06:20,008 --> 01:06:22,511
Somebody blew out
a fuse in the lab.

399
01:06:22,616 --> 01:06:26,162
Lights were out for an hour.
Any one of us could have gotten to him.

400
01:06:26,266 --> 01:06:28,144
All right,
we gotta find him.

401
01:06:28,248 --> 01:06:31,377
Nauls, why don't you
come with me and we'll look outside.

402
01:06:31,482 --> 01:06:33,672
Palmer, you and Windows
check the inside.

403
01:06:33,777 --> 01:06:36,280
I ain't goin' with Windows.

404
01:06:36,384 --> 01:06:39,931
I ain't goin' with him.
I'll go with Childs.

405
01:06:40,035 --> 01:06:43,164
- Hey, fuck you, Palmer!
- I ain't goin' with you!

406
01:06:43,269 --> 01:06:45,563
- Who says I want you goin' with me?
- All right, cut the bullshit!

407
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:51,300
Windows, you come with us.
Norris, you stay here.

408
01:06:51,405 --> 01:06:55,056
Any of them move, you fry 'em.
You hear anything at all,
you cut loose on the sirens.

409
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,811
We all meet back here
in 20 minutes, regardless!

410
01:06:58,915 --> 01:07:01,523
And everybody watch
whoever you're with,

411
01:07:01,627 --> 01:07:03,505
real close.

412
01:07:25,514 --> 01:07:27,600
Hey, Blair!

413
01:07:29,164 --> 01:07:31,876
Blair, have you seen Fuchs?

414
01:07:35,214 --> 01:07:40,013
I don't want to stay out here anymore.
I want to come back inside.

415
01:07:41,473 --> 01:07:44,811
Funny things.
I hear funny things out here.

416
01:07:44,915 --> 01:07:47,627
- Have you come across Fuchs?
- It ain't Fuchs.

417
01:07:51,487 --> 01:07:53,468
It ain't Fuchs.

418
01:07:53,573 --> 01:07:57,223
I'm not gonna harm anybody,
and there's nothing wrong with me.

419
01:07:57,328 --> 01:07:59,310
And if there was,
I'm all better now.

420
01:07:59,414 --> 01:08:03,691
I'd like to come back inside.
You got my promise.

421
01:08:05,464 --> 01:08:08,072
We'll see.

422
01:08:08,176 --> 01:08:11,514
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, man.

423
01:08:11,618 --> 01:08:15,060
I want to come back inside.
Don't you understand?

424
01:08:15,165 --> 01:08:19,754
I'm all right. I'm much better.
I won't harm anybody.

425
01:08:19,858 --> 01:08:22,675
You gotta let me
come back inside.

426
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:30,915
Hold it!

427
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:47,292
Is it Fuchs?

428
01:08:54,176 --> 01:08:56,575
Yeah.

429
01:08:56,679 --> 01:08:59,391
Why would it burn him?

430
01:08:59,496 --> 01:09:02,938
Flare. Maybe he tried
to burn it.

431
01:09:05,754 --> 01:09:07,945
Maybe he burned himself...

432
01:09:08,049 --> 01:09:10,552
before it could get to him.

433
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:20,566
Great! Now what are we
gonna do?

434
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:23,904
You go inside.
Tell the others we found Fuchs.

435
01:09:24,008 --> 01:09:26,303
We'll be in
as soon as we can.

436
01:09:26,407 --> 01:09:28,598
- Where are we goin'?
- Up to my shack.

437
01:09:28,702 --> 01:09:33,396
- What the hell for?
- 'Cause when I left,
I turned the lights off.

438
01:09:56,031 --> 01:09:58,430
How long have they
been out there?

439
01:09:58,534 --> 01:10:00,725
Forty, forty-five minutes.

440
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:03,750
We better start closing off
the outside doors.

441
01:10:36,503 --> 01:10:39,632
Hey! All of you come here!

442
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:59,242
Open up! Open up this door!
Open up! Open up!

443
01:11:01,015 --> 01:11:03,727
Close that door.

444
01:11:03,832 --> 01:11:07,378
Where's MacReady?

445
01:11:07,483 --> 01:11:11,238
- I cut him loose of the line
up by his shack.
- Cut him loose?

446
01:11:11,342 --> 01:11:14,576
Yeah. We were up
checkin' around his place.

447
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,288
I found this.

448
01:11:17,392 --> 01:11:19,269
Look.

449
01:11:19,374 --> 01:11:21,669
It was stashed
in his own oil furnace.

450
01:11:21,773 --> 01:11:24,589
Wind must have dislodged it,
but I don't think he saw me find it.

451
01:11:24,693 --> 01:11:28,657
I made sure I got ahead
of him on the towline on the way back.

452
01:11:28,761 --> 01:11:30,743
I cut him loose.

453
01:11:30,848 --> 01:11:33,142
- MacReady?
- He's one of them.

454
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,646
- When did it get to him?
- I don't know.

455
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:39,192
It could have been
anytime, anywhere.

456
01:11:39,297 --> 01:11:41,696
- If it did get to him.
- Look, Childs, come on!

457
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,095
- When the lights went out!
- That would have been the perfect time.

458
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:47,120
Right! You said guys were missing.
And, Windows, where were you?

459
01:11:47,224 --> 01:11:49,206
Palmer, I told you
to shut the fuck up!

460
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:51,501
Where were you
when the lights when out?

461
01:11:51,605 --> 01:11:54,734
That's what it wants:
To pit us against each other!

462
01:11:54,839 --> 01:11:56,716
Guys! It's MacReady.

463
01:11:56,821 --> 01:11:58,907
Shh!

464
01:12:01,097 --> 01:12:02,975
- Let's open it.
- Hell no!

465
01:12:03,079 --> 01:12:05,478
- Do you think he's changed
into one of those things?
- He's had plenty of time.

466
01:12:05,582 --> 01:12:08,607
- Nothing human could have made it
back here without a guideline.
- Let's open it now!

467
01:12:08,712 --> 01:12:11,424
- Why are you so damn anxious
to let him in here?
- 'Cause it's so close!

468
01:12:11,528 --> 01:12:13,614
- May be our best chance
to blow it away!
- No!

469
01:12:13,719 --> 01:12:18,204
- Just let him freeze to death outside.
- What if we're wrong about him?

470
01:12:18,308 --> 01:12:21,124
Why, then we're wrong!

471
01:12:21,229 --> 01:12:23,419
Supply window!

472
01:12:23,524 --> 01:12:27,383
All right, all right.
We got no choice now!

473
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:32,807
Damn it!
He's got the keys!

474
01:12:32,911 --> 01:12:35,102
What's goin' on? The towline snapped.

475
01:12:35,206 --> 01:12:38,335
That's bullshit, Childs.
He knows damn well I cut it.

476
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:43,968
You're a dead man, MacReady!

477
01:12:43,968 --> 01:12:46,784
Or a dead
whatever the hell you are!

478
01:12:57,007 --> 01:13:01,075
Anyone messes with me
and the whole camp goes.

479
01:13:01,179 --> 01:13:03,474
Come on, Childs, burn me.

480
01:13:04,725 --> 01:13:07,959
Put those torches
on the floor and back off.

481
01:13:15,678 --> 01:13:19,016
Back off. Way off.

482
01:13:28,299 --> 01:13:30,803
- You asshole.
- You'd have done the same thing.

483
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,785
Don't argue with him.

484
01:13:34,662 --> 01:13:36,018
Where's the rest?

485
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:42,277
So help me, I mean it!

486
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:44,467
It's cool, MacReady.
It's cool, man! Come on!

487
01:13:44,571 --> 01:13:46,970
Yeah, yeah, man.
Just relax.

488
01:13:47,075 --> 01:13:51,351
Anybody touches me,
and we go.

489
01:14:03,243 --> 01:14:05,120
He's not breathin'!

490
01:14:05,225 --> 01:14:08,145
Go untie the doc.

491
01:14:08,249 --> 01:14:11,692
Get him in here.
And bring the others.

492
01:14:15,342 --> 01:14:18,472
From now on, nobody
gets out of my sight.

493
01:14:27,025 --> 01:14:29,528
Lay him there.

494
01:14:33,284 --> 01:14:35,265
So you sweethearts...

495
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:38,082
were about to have yourselves
a little lynching party, huh?

496
01:14:38,186 --> 01:14:43,506
I might just have to put an end
to you on general principles, Nauls.

497
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:47,261
Did it occur to the jury that
anybody could have stuck some
of my clothes up the furnace?

498
01:14:47,365 --> 01:14:49,243
We ain't buyin' that.

499
01:14:49,347 --> 01:14:51,433
Quit that bickering over there!

500
01:14:51,538 --> 01:14:54,354
Windows, wheel that
defibrillator over here!

501
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:56,544
Put some gel
on those paddles!

502
01:14:56,649 --> 01:14:59,048
You're gonna have
to sleep sometime, MacReady.

503
01:14:59,152 --> 01:15:02,281
I'm a real
light sleeper, Childs.

504
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:06,245
If anyone tries
to wake me...

505
01:15:06,349 --> 01:15:08,331
Uh-uh.

506
01:15:10,417 --> 01:15:11,252
Clear!

507
01:15:19,701 --> 01:15:20,744
- Clear!
- Clear.

508
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,286
- We're on fire, MacReady!
- Get back! Just wait!

509
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:23,851
- We're on fire!
- Just wait!

510
01:16:31,778 --> 01:16:33,760
All right, go!

511
01:16:54,935 --> 01:16:57,647
Windows!
Windows, get in here!

512
01:17:22,368 --> 01:17:25,914
You gotta be fuckin' kidding.

513
01:17:44,899 --> 01:17:47,924
- What do you got in mind, MacReady?
- A little test.

514
01:17:48,028 --> 01:17:52,096
Windows, you and Palmer
tie everybody down real tight.

515
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,286
- What for?
- For your health.

516
01:17:54,391 --> 01:17:56,164
Let's rush him!
He's not gonna blow us all up!

517
01:18:00,441 --> 01:18:02,944
No, no, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

518
01:18:03,048 --> 01:18:06,908
Let's do what Mac says.

519
01:18:07,012 --> 01:18:09,933
I mean, he wasted Norris
pretty quick, didn't he?

520
01:18:10,037 --> 01:18:12,019
That's close enough, Clark.

521
01:18:12,123 --> 01:18:16,295
- He ain't tyin' me up.
- Then I'll have to kill you.

522
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,008
Then kill me.

523
01:18:27,248 --> 01:18:29,543
I mean it.

524
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:37,887
I guess you do.

525
01:18:50,196 --> 01:18:52,699
- This is bullshit, Mac!
- Finish it, Palmer.

526
01:18:52,804 --> 01:18:55,203
They're dead, Mac!

527
01:18:59,897 --> 01:19:02,713
- Windows?
- Yo?

528
01:19:02,817 --> 01:19:06,468
You tie up Palmer over here.

529
01:19:09,493 --> 01:19:13,457
We're gonna draw a little bit
of everybody's blood.

530
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:17,942
'Cause we're gonna find out
who's the thing.

531
01:19:19,402 --> 01:19:23,262
Watching Norris in there
gave me the idea that...

532
01:19:23,366 --> 01:19:27,330
maybe every part of him
was a whole.

533
01:19:27,434 --> 01:19:31,085
Every little piece
was an individual animal...

534
01:19:31,189 --> 01:19:35,153
with a built-in desire
to protect its own life.

535
01:19:36,822 --> 01:19:40,264
You see, when a man bleeds,

536
01:19:40,368 --> 01:19:42,767
it's just tissue.

537
01:19:44,541 --> 01:19:49,130
But blood from one of you things
won't obey when it's attacked.

538
01:19:49,235 --> 01:19:52,155
It'll try and survive;

539
01:19:52,259 --> 01:19:56,536
crawl away
from a hot needle, say.

540
01:20:17,398 --> 01:20:19,275
Now you.

541
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:43,892
That's good.

542
01:20:43,997 --> 01:20:47,647
All right, move back.
Over there.

543
01:21:34,273 --> 01:21:37,194
I guess you're okay.

544
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:43,348
All right, put that on
and watch them.

545
01:21:51,067 --> 01:21:55,031
Now I'll show you
what I already know.

546
01:21:58,577 --> 01:22:01,081
That's a crock of shit.

547
01:22:01,185 --> 01:22:04,106
Let's try the Doc and Clark.

548
01:22:21,421 --> 01:22:23,403
Now Clark.

549
01:22:32,478 --> 01:22:35,085
Then Clark was human, huh?

550
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:38,423
Which makes you
a murderer, don't it?

551
01:22:38,528 --> 01:22:40,405
Palmer now.

552
01:22:47,081 --> 01:22:50,210
This is pure nonsense.
It doesn't prove a thing.

553
01:22:50,314 --> 01:22:52,192
I thought you'd
feel that way, Garry.

554
01:22:52,296 --> 01:22:55,008
You were the only one that
could have got to that blood.

555
01:22:55,113 --> 01:22:57,616
We'll do you last.

556
01:23:00,432 --> 01:23:03,353
Get away from me!
MacReady, burn it!

557
01:23:03,457 --> 01:23:06,899
What is it?

558
01:23:07,004 --> 01:23:09,194
Get him, get him! Just shoot!

559
01:23:20,355 --> 01:23:24,945
MacReady, shoot!

560
01:23:25,049 --> 01:23:27,240
- Get it, Mac!
- Get it!

561
01:23:31,621 --> 01:23:33,498
Windows! Blast him!

562
01:23:36,419 --> 01:23:38,714
Get me outta here!

563
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:09,693
Windows!

564
01:24:30,764 --> 01:24:32,850
Damn! Get me outta here!

565
01:24:53,294 --> 01:24:54,755
MacReady!

566
01:24:54,859 --> 01:24:56,945
- Get in here!
- Quick, come on! Hurry up!

567
01:24:57,049 --> 01:24:59,866
It's coming back! Burn it!
Burn it, for God's sake!

568
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:03,099
- Burn it! Burn it!
- Hurry up, MacReady!

569
01:25:36,061 --> 01:25:37,834
Let's do it.

570
01:25:51,186 --> 01:25:55,254
Get me outta here! Cut me loose!

571
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:57,757
Cut me the hell...
Come on, get me outta here!

572
01:25:57,861 --> 01:26:00,886
Come on, get me outta here!
Cut me loose, damn it!

573
01:26:18,723 --> 01:26:22,791
I know you gentlemen
have been through a lot,

574
01:26:22,895 --> 01:26:25,190
but when you find the time,

575
01:26:25,295 --> 01:26:28,528
I'd rather not spend
the rest of this winter...

576
01:26:28,632 --> 01:26:31,344
tied to this fucking couch!

577
01:26:52,728 --> 01:26:54,814
Childs...

578
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:56,900
we're goin' out
to give Blair the test.

579
01:26:57,004 --> 01:26:59,404
If he tries to make it back
and we're not with him,

580
01:26:59,508 --> 01:27:01,594
burn him.

581
01:27:20,787 --> 01:27:23,812
Mac, the door is open.

582
01:27:37,789 --> 01:27:41,961
How'd he get out?
The door was bolted from the outside.

583
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:27,857
Blair?

584
01:28:30,987 --> 01:28:33,490
Hey, Blair! You down there?

585
01:28:33,594 --> 01:28:35,889
We got something for ya!

586
01:28:46,216 --> 01:28:50,179
Blair's been busy
out here all by himself.

587
01:28:58,733 --> 01:29:02,488
- What is it?
- Something he's been making.

588
01:29:02,592 --> 01:29:05,826
It's a ship of some kind.

589
01:29:05,930 --> 01:29:08,120
He stole the parts
from the helicopter.

590
01:29:08,225 --> 01:29:12,710
Smart s.o.b. He put it together
piece by piece.

591
01:29:12,814 --> 01:29:15,526
Where was he
tryin' to go?

592
01:29:15,631 --> 01:29:18,656
Anyplace but here.

593
01:29:56,937 --> 01:30:00,275
Hey, you guys, come here.
Come here.

594
01:30:06,638 --> 01:30:10,497
I think I saw Childs outside
the main entrance of the camp.

595
01:30:10,601 --> 01:30:13,418
- What's he doing outside?
- I don't know.

596
01:30:24,370 --> 01:30:26,665
Got a flare?

597
01:30:28,751 --> 01:30:32,402
He got back inside
and blew the generator.

598
01:30:34,175 --> 01:30:37,096
In six hours,
it'll be 100 below in here.

599
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,869
Well, that's suicide!

600
01:30:38,973 --> 01:30:41,581
Not for that thing.

601
01:30:41,685 --> 01:30:44,084
It wants to freeze now.

602
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:48,570
It's got no way outta here.
It just wants to go to sleep
until the rescue team finds it.

603
01:30:50,656 --> 01:30:53,681
What can we do?
What can we do?

604
01:30:55,141 --> 01:30:59,522
Whether we make it or not,
we can't let that thing freeze again.

605
01:30:59,626 --> 01:31:03,486
Maybe we'll just warm things up
a little around here.

606
01:31:07,241 --> 01:31:10,057
We're not gettin'
outta here alive...

607
01:31:12,039 --> 01:31:14,334
but neither
is that thing.

608
01:33:03,545 --> 01:33:05,631
Generator room.

609
01:34:13,119 --> 01:34:15,205
Generator's gone.

610
01:34:15,309 --> 01:34:17,709
Any way we can fix it?

611
01:34:17,813 --> 01:34:21,881
It's gone, MacReady.

612
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:35,337
All right. We gotta bring this
whole place right down into the ice.

613
01:34:35,441 --> 01:34:39,196
Garry, plant yours
in the old storage room.

614
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:42,012
Nauls, down by the generator.

615
01:35:31,872 --> 01:35:34,584
Oh, God.

616
01:36:44,054 --> 01:36:47,913
How's it comin' in there?

617
01:36:48,017 --> 01:36:51,251
I said, "How's it..."

618
01:38:35,247 --> 01:38:38,376
Yeah, fuck you too!

619
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:05,474
You the only one who made it?

620
01:40:05,578 --> 01:40:09,020
Not the only one.

621
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:11,002
Did you kill it?

622
01:40:12,567 --> 01:40:15,696
Where were you, Childs?

623
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:18,199
Thought I saw Blair.

624
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:21,537
I went out after him...

625
01:40:21,642 --> 01:40:25,188
and got lost in the storm.

626
01:40:33,637 --> 01:40:37,184
Fires got the temperature up
all over the camp.

627
01:40:38,748 --> 01:40:41,147
Won't last long though.

628
01:40:41,252 --> 01:40:45,111
Neither will we.

629
01:40:45,215 --> 01:40:48,970
How will we make it?

630
01:40:49,075 --> 01:40:52,830
Maybe we shouldn't.

631
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:58,254
If you're worried about me...

632
01:40:58,358 --> 01:41:02,113
If we've got any surprises
for each other,

633
01:41:02,218 --> 01:41:06,599
I don't think we're in much shape
to do anything about it.

634
01:41:10,249 --> 01:41:14,526
Well... what do we do?

635
01:41:14,630 --> 01:41:18,698
Why don't we just...

636
01:41:18,803 --> 01:41:22,871
wait here
for a little while,

637
01:41:22,975 --> 01:41:25,896
see what happens.

638
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,816
Yeah.
