2
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,745
- Wow.
- Mmm.

3
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,915
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,084
- Wow.
- Yes, Marlin.

5
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,211
No, I see it.
It's beautiful.

6
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,755
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view...

7
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,968
you didn't think you'd get
the whole ocean, did you?

8
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:55,806
Oh, yeah.
A fish can breathe out here.

9
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,808
Did your man deliver,
or did he deliver?

10
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,102
- My man delivered.
- And it wasn't so easy.

11
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,438
Because a lot of other clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,941
You better believe they did...
every single one of them.

13
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,985
Mm-hmm. You did good.

14
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,654
And the neighborhood
is awesome.

15
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,332
So, you do like it, don't you?

16
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,836
No, no. I do, I do.
I really do like it.

17
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,839
But, Marlin, I know that
the drop off is desirable...

18
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,133
with the great schools
and the amazing view...

19
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,926
but do we really need
so much space?

20
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,218
But do we really need
so much space?

21
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,054
Coral, honey, these are our kids
we're talking about.

22
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,265
They deserve the best.
Look, look, look.

23
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,517
They'll wake up,
poke their little heads out...

24
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,435
and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

25
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,645
And they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

26
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,981
Shh. You'll wake the kids.

27
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,816
Oh, right, right.

28
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:56,325
Aw, look. They're dreaming.

29
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,493
We still have to name them.

30
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,329
You want to name
all of them right now?

31
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,624
All right, we'll name
this half Marlin Junior...

32
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,792
and this half Coral Junior.

33
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,378
- OK, we're done.
- I like Nemo.

34
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,173
Nemo. We'll name one Nemo...

35
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,800
but I'd like most of them
to be Marlin Junior.

36
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,219
Just think,
in a couple of days...

37
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:18,722
- we're going to be parents.
- Yeah.

38
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,390
What if they don't like me?

39
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,975
- Marlin.
- No, really.

40
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:26,980
There's over 400 eggs.
Odds are, one will like you.

41
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,318
What?

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,988
- You remember how we met?
- I try not to.

43
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,490
Well, I remember.
"Excuse me, miss...

44
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,992
"can you check and see
if I have a hook in my lip?"

45
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,411
You got a little closer
because it was wiggling.

46
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,540
- Get away, get away!
- Here he is. Cutie's here.

47
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,544
Where did everybody go?

48
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,386
Coral, get inside the house.

49
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,348
No, Coral, don't.
They'll be fine.

50
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,976
Just get inside...
You, right now.

51
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,605
No! Ow!

52
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,566
Oh!

53
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,234
Ooh! Ooh!

54
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,417
Coral!

55
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,883
Coral?

56
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,386
Coral?

57
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,519
Coral?

58
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,315
Coral?

59
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,989
Coral?

60
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,754
Oh!

61
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,676
Ohh.

62
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,555
There, there, there.

63
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,099
It's OK. Daddy's here.

64
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,977
Daddy's got you.

65
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:36,360
I promise, I will never
let anything happen to you...

66
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,153
Nemo.

67
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,067
NEMO: First day of school!

68
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,862
Wake up, wake up!
First day of school.

69
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,406
I don't want to go to school...
five more minutes.

70
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,699
Not you, Dad, me.

71
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,158
- OK. Huh?
- Get up, get up.

72
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,870
It's time for school,
time for school.

73
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,496
All right, I'm up.

74
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,206
Whoa!

75
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,958
- Nemo!
- First day of school!

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,169
- Nemo, don't move.
- Unh! Unh!

77
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,587
You'll never get out
of there yourself.

78
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,797
I'll do it. Unh!

79
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,799
- You feel a break?
- No.

80
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,551
Sometimes you can't tell
'cause fluid rushes to the area.

81
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,803
- Are you woozy?
- No.

82
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,097
- How many stripes do I have?
- I'm fine.

83
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,932
- Answer the stripe question.
- Three.

84
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,434
No! See?
Something's wrong with you.

85
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,270
I have one, two, three...
That's all I have?

86
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:56,231
You're OK.
How's the lucky fin?

87
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,067
- Lucky.
- Let's see.

88
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,029
Are you sure you want to go
to school this year?

89
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,948
There's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

90
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,867
Come on, Dad,
it's time for school.

91
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,578
- Forgot to brush.
- Ohh.

92
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,580
Do you want this anemone
to sting you?

93
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,041
- Yes.
- Brush.

94
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,751
- OK, I'm done.
- You missed a spot.

95
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,084
- Where?
- There.

96
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,753
- Where?
- There.

97
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,756
Ha ha! Right there.
And here and here.

98
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:29,723
All right, we're excited.

99
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,891
All right, we're excited.

100
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,684
The first day of school.
Here we go.

101
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,686
We're ready to learn
to get some knowledge.

102
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,147
What's the one thing we have
to remember about the ocean?

103
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,608
- It's not safe.
- That's my boy.

104
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,902
First, we check to see
that the coast is clear.

105
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,321
We go out... and back in.

106
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,657
And then we go out...
and back in.

107
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,743
And then one more time...
out and back in.

108
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,620
And sometimes, if you want
to do it four times...

109
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,997
- Dad...
- All right, come on, boy.

110
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,795
Maybe while I'm at school,
I'll see a shark.

111
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,506
- I highly doubt that.
- Have you ever met a shark?

112
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,216
No, and I don't plan to.

113
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,469
- How old are sea turtles?
- I don't know.

114
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,179
Sandy Plankton
from next door...

115
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,140
he says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

116
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,560
He says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

117
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,854
If I ever meet a sea turtle,
I'll ask him.

118
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,856
After I'm done
talking to the shark, OK?

119
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,440
Whoa! Hold on.
Wait to cross.

120
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,484
Whoa! Hold on.
Wait to cross.

121
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,695
Hold my fin.

122
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,071
Dad, you're not
going to freak out...

123
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,115
like you did at
the petting zoo, are you?

124
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,909
MARLIN:
That snail was about to charge.

125
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,370
Hmm. I wonder where
we're supposed to go.

126
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,913
ALL: Bye, Mom!

127
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,040
I'll pick you up after school.

128
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,792
Ha ha!

129
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,879
Come on, you guys, stop it!
Give it back!

130
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,923
Come on,
we'll try over there.

131
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,343
Excuse me, is this where
we meet his teacher?

132
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,888
Well, look who's out
of the anemone.

133
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:51,638
Yes. Shocking, I know.

134
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,139
Yes. Shocking, I know.

135
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,932
- Marty, right?
- Marlin.

136
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,142
- Bob.
- Ted.

137
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,186
Bill.
Hey, you're a clownfish.

138
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,771
You're funny, right?
Tell us a joke.

139
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,106
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

140
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,067
Well, actually,
that's a common misconception.

141
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,612
Clownfish are no funnier
than any other fish.

142
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,655
- Come on, clownie.
- Do something funny.

143
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,158
All right, I know one joke.

144
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,245
There's a mollusk, see?
And he walks up to a sea...

145
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,372
He doesn't walk up,
he swims up.

146
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,249
Actually,
the mollusk isn't moving.

147
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,878
He's in one place,
and then the sea cucumber...

148
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,379
Well, they... I'm mixed up.

149
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,132
There was a mollusk
and a sea cucumber.

150
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,175
None of them were walking,
so forget that l...

151
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:28,717
None of them were walking,
so forget that l...

152
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,012
Sheldon! Get out of
Mr. Johannsen's yard now!

153
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,389
- Whoa!
- All right, you kids!

154
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,518
Ooh, where'd you go?

155
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,728
Dad, can I go play, too?
Can I?

156
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,731
I would feel better if
you'd play on the sponge beds.

157
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,279
That's where I would play.

158
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,367
- What's wrong with his fin?
- He looks funny.

159
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,786
Ow! Hey, what'd I do?

160
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,788
Be nice.
It's his first time at school.

161
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,499
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.

162
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,793
- Dad...
- See this tentacle?

163
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,962
It's actually shorter
than all my other tentacles...

164
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,130
but you can't really tell.

165
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,633
Especially when
I twirl them like this.

166
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,718
I'm H-2-O intolerant.

167
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,720
- Ah-choo!
- I'm obnoxious.

168
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,305
* Oh *

169
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:18,183
* Let's name the zones,
the zones, the zones *

170
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,395
* Let's name
the zones of the open sea *

171
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,604
KIDS: Mr. Ray!

172
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,566
- Come on, Nemo.
- You better stay with me.

173
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,442
* Mesopelagic, bathyal,
abyssalpelagic *

174
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,946
* All the rest are too deep
for you and me to see *

175
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:34,283
Huh. I wonder where
my class has gone?

176
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,076
ALL: We're under here!

177
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,953
Oh, there you are.

178
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,580
Climb aboard, explorers.

179
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,914
* Oh, knowledge
exploring *

180
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,457
* Is, oh, so lyrical *

181
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,918
* When you think thoughts
that are empirical *

182
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,128
Dad, you can go now.

183
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,256
- Hello. Who is this?
- I'm Nemo.

184
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,968
Nemo, all new explorers
must answer a science question.

185
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,804
- OK.
- You live in what kind of home?

186
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,514
An anemon-none.

187
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,558
A nemenem-menome.

188
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,644
OK, don't hurt yourself.
Welcome aboard, explorers.

189
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,605
Just so you know,
he's got a little fin.

190
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,315
I find if he's having
trouble swimming...

191
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,317
I let him take a break,
10, 15 minutes.

192
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,777
NEMO: Dad, it's time
for you to go now.

193
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,863
Don't worry. We're gonna
stay together as a group.

194
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,324
OK, class,
optical orbits up front.

195
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,327
And remember, we keep
our supraesophogeal ganglion...

196
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,829
to ourselves.
That means you, Jimmy.

197
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:20,954
JIMMY: Aw, man!

198
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,831
JIMMY: Aw, man!

199
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,875
Bye, Nemo!

200
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,335
Bye, Dad!

201
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,003
Bye, son!

202
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,007
Be safe.

203
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,635
You're doing pretty well
for a first-timer.

204
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,012
You can't hold on to them
forever, can you?

205
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,264
I had a tough time with
my oldest out at the drop off.

206
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,558
They got to grow up...
The drop off?

207
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,478
They're going to the drop off?
What are you, insane?

208
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,814
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

209
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,107
Hey, Marty, calm down.

210
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,401
Don't tell me
to be calm, pony boy.

211
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,737
Pony boy?

212
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,657
For a clownfish,
he really isn't that funny.

213
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,075
Pity.

214
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,993
* Oh *

215
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,579
* Let's name the species,
the species, the species *

216
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:03,914
* Let's name the species
that live in the sea *

217
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,123
NEMO: Whoa.

218
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,959
* There's *

219
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,044
* Porifera, coelenterata,
hydrozoa, scyphozoa *

220
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,171
* Anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three *

221
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,882
* Gastropoda, arthropoda,
echinoderma *

222
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,217
* And some fish
like you and me *

223
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,552
Come on, sing with me.

224
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,929
* Oh *

225
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,686
Just the girls this time.

226
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,688
* Oh, seaweed is cool *

227
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:28,981
* Seaweed is fun *

228
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,482
* It makes its food *

229
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,821
OK, the drop off.

230
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,115
All right, kids,
feel free to explore...

231
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,324
but stay close.

232
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,577
Stromalitic
cyanobacteria! Gather.

233
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,622
An entire ecosystem contained
in one infinitesimal speck.

234
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,332
There are as many protein pairs
contained in this...

235
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,793
Come on, let's go.

236
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,211
Come on, sing with me!

237
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,505
* There's porifera,
coelenterata *

238
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,007
* Hydrozoa, scyphozoa *

239
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,633
* Anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three *

240
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,678
Hey, guys, wait up!

241
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,972
Whoa.

242
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,727
Cool.

243
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,022
Saved your life!

244
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,399
Aw, you guys made me ink.

245
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,277
What's that?

246
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,740
TAD: I know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.

247
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,868
He said it was called a butt.

248
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,328
- Whoa.
- Wow.

249
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,663
That's a pretty big butt.

250
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,335
Oh, look at me.
I'm going to touch the butt.

251
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,837
- Ah-choo! Whoa!
- Ha ha ha!

252
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,673
Oh, yeah?
Let's see you get closer.

253
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,342
OK.

254
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,886
Beat that.

255
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,472
Come on, Nemo.
How far can you go?

256
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,974
My dad says it's not safe.

257
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,936
- Nemo! No!
- Dad?

258
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,395
You were about
to swim into open water.

259
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,647
No, I wasn't...

260
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,524
Good thing I was here.
If I hadn't shown up...

261
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,817
- He wasn't going to go.
- He was too afraid.

262
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,152
No, I wasn't.

263
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,654
This does not
concern you, kids...

264
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,031
and you're lucky
I don't tell your parents.

265
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:02,366
You know you can't swim well.

266
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,368
I can swim fine, Dad, OK?

267
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:07,287
No, it's not OK.
You shouldn't be near here.

268
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,706
OK, I was right. You'll start
school in a year or two.

269
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,501
No, Dad! Just because
you're scared of the ocean...

270
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:13,001
Clearly, you're not ready...

271
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:13,669
Clearly, you're not ready...

272
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,878
and you're not coming back
until you are.

273
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,171
You think
you can do these things...

274
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,131
but you just can't, Nemo!

275
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,051
I hate you.

276
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:24,888
* There's *

277
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,765
Nothing to see.
Gather. Over there.

278
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,058
Excuse me.
Is there anything I can do?

279
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,185
I am a scientist, sir.
Is there any problem?

280
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,312
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt things.

281
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,190
He isn't a good swimmer,
and it's a little too soon...

282
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,942
for him to be out here
unsupervised.

283
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,735
MR. RAY: I can assure you,
he's quite safe with me.

284
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,738
MARLIN: I'm sure he is,
but you have a large class...

285
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,616
and he can get lost from sight
if you're not looking.

286
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:44,867
I'm not saying
you're not looking.

287
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:45,826
I'm not saying
you're not looking.

288
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,829
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo's swimming out to sea!

289
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:51,874
Nemo!

290
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,002
What do you think you're doing?

291
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,838
You'll get stuck out there...

292
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,341
and I'll have to get you
before another fish does.

293
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,302
Get back here!

294
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,346
I said get back here now!

295
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:11,226
Stop! You take
one more move, mister...

296
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,103
Don't you dare!

297
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,230
If you put one fin
on that boat...

298
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:16,732
Are you listening to me?

299
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,402
Don't touch the bo... Nemo!

300
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,070
He touched the butt.

301
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,865
You paddle your little tail
right back here, Nemo.

302
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,074
That's right.

303
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,784
You are in big trouble,
young man.

304
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,620
Do you hear me? Big...

305
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,415
- Big...
- Aah!

306
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,585
Aah!

307
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,712
Daddy! Help me!

308
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:41,715
I'm coming, Nemo!

309
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,968
- Aah!
- Get under me, kids!

310
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,386
Aah! Oh! No!

311
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,096
Dad!

312
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,557
Daddy!

313
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,647
Oh! Nemo!

314
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,109
Unh. Nemo!

315
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,780
Nemo, no! Nemo!

316
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,783
Nemo! Nemo! No!

317
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,162
No!

318
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:15,123
Aah!

319
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,461
Uhh.

320
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,589
Nemo! Nemo!

321
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,142
Whoa! Hold on.

322
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,156
Oh, no.

323
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,784
No. No, it's gone.
It's gone.

324
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,119
No, no,
it can't be gone.

325
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:54,496
No, no! Nemo!

326
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,123
Nemo! Nemo!

327
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,708
Nemo! Nemo!

328
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,002
No!

329
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,671
Nemo! Nemo!

330
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:05,507
No! No, please, no!

331
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,511
No, no!

332
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,473
Has anybody seen a boat?

333
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,350
Please! A white boat!

334
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,019
They took my son!

335
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,563
My son! Help me, please.

336
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,481
- Look out!
- What?

337
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,901
Ooh. Ohh.

338
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:27,529
Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry.
I didn't see you.

339
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,866
- Sir? Are you OK?
- He's gone, he's gone.

340
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,367
There, there.
It's all right.

341
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,660
- He's gone.
- It'll be OK.

342
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,247
No, no. They took him away.
I have to find the boat.

343
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:39,374
A boat?
Hey, I've seen a boat.

344
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,710
- You have?
- It passed by not too long ago.

345
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:44,087
- A white one?
- Hi. I'm Dory.

346
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,339
Where? Which way?

347
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,549
Oh, oh, oh.
It went this way.

348
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:48,967
It went this way.
Follow me.

349
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,387
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you so much.

350
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,555
No problem.

351
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,123
MARLIN: Hey...

352
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,583
Wait!

353
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,758
- Will you quit it?
- What?

354
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,594
I'm trying to swim here.
Ocean isn't big enough for you?

355
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:32,970
You got a problem, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

356
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,805
You got a problem, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

357
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:37,558
Do you? Do you?
You want a piece of me?

358
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,434
Ooh, I'm scared now. What?

359
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,104
- Wait a minute.
- Stop following me, OK?

360
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,274
What? You're showing me
where the boat went.

361
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,900
A boat?
Hey, I've seen a boat.

362
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,109
A boat?
Hey, I've seen a boat.

363
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,320
It passed by not too long ago.
It went this way.

364
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:51,780
It went this way.
Follow me.

365
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,949
Wait a minute.
What is going on?

366
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,285
You already told me
which way the boat was going.

367
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:59,496
I did? Oh, no.

368
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:01,832
If this is some kind of
practical joke, it's not funny.

369
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:04,168
And I know funny.
I'm a clownfish.

370
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,629
No, it's not. I know it's not.
I'm so sorry.

371
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,632
See, I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

372
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:14,469
Short-term memory loss.
I don't believe this.

373
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,388
No, it's true. I forget things
almost instantly.

374
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,392
It runs in my family.
At least, I think it does.

375
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:24,479
Um, hmm. Where are they?

376
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,652
Can I help you?

377
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:33,322
Something's wrong
with you... really.

378
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,199
You're wasting my time.

379
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,326
I have to find my son.

380
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,122
Hello.

381
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,166
- Ohh.
- Well, hi!

382
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,211
Name's Bruce.

383
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,004
It's all right.
I understand.

384
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:52,799
Why trust a shark, right?

385
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,976
So, what's a couple
of bites like you...

386
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,686
doing out so late, eh?

387
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,730
We're not doing anything.
We're not even out.

388
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:09,024
Great!
Then how'd you morsels...

389
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:12,319
like to come to a little
get-together I'm having?

390
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,529
You mean, like a party?

391
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,658
Yeah, right. A party.
What do you say?

392
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,868
I love parties.
That sounds like fun.

393
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,287
Parties are fun,
and it's tempting, but...

394
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:26,250
Oh, come on, I insist.

395
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,461
MARLIN: OK.
That's all that matters.

396
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,258
DORY: Hey, look, balloons.
It is a party.

397
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,635
BRUCE: Ha ha ha ha!
Mind your distance, though.

398
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,346
Those balloons
can be a bit dodgy.

399
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:41,682
You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

400
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,150
MARLIN: Oh.

401
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,611
Ohh.

402
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,240
Anchor! Chum!

403
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:01,076
There you are, Bruce.
Finally.

404
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:03,787
- We got company.
- It's about time, mate.

405
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:04,705
We've already gone
through the snacks...

406
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:05,289
We've already gone
through the snacks...

407
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,915
and I'm still starving.

408
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,126
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

409
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:10,919
Come on,
let's get this over with.

410
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,755
BRUCE: Right, then.

411
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,091
The meeting has officially
come to order.

412
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,593
Let us all say the pledge.

413
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:22,139
I am a nice shark,
not a mindless eating machine.

414
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:24,808
If I am to change this image...

415
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,311
I must first change myself.

416
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:30,063
Fish are friends, not food.

417
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,440
Except stinkin' dolphins.

418
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:34,484
Dolphins. Yeah.
They think they're so cute.

419
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:36,278
"Look at me.
I'm a flippin' little dolphin.

420
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,946
"Let me flip for you.
Ain't I something?"

421
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,616
Right, then.
Today's meeting is Step 5...

422
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,284
Bring a Fish Friend.

423
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:43,827
Do you all have your friends?

424
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,037
Got mine.

425
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,041
- Hey, there.
- How about you, Chum?

426
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:53,629
Oh, I... seem to have
misplaced my friend.

427
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,590
BRUCE: That's all right, Chum.

428
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,133
I had a feeling
this would be a difficult step.

429
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,718
You can help yourself
to one of my friends.

430
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,222
Thanks, mate.
A little chum for Chum, eh?

431
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,932
BRUCE: I'll start
the testimonies.

432
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,184
Hello. My name is Bruce.

433
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:08,477
BOTH: Hello, Bruce.

434
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,687
It has been three weeks
since my last fish.

435
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,191
On my honor, or may I be
chopped up and made into soup.

436
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,985
- You're an inspiration!
- Amen.

437
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,655
Right, then. Who's next?

438
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:20,989
DORY: Pick me, pick me.

439
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:22,866
Yes. The little
Sheila down the front.

440
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,993
- Whoo!
- Come on up here.

441
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,830
Hi. I'm Dory.

442
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:30,249
- Hello, Dory.
- And, uh, well...

443
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,460
I don't think
I've ever eaten a fish.

444
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:37,047
- That's incredible.
- Good on you, mate.

445
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,132
I'm glad
I got that off my chest.

446
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,509
All right, anyone else?

447
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:43,136
How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

448
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,389
MARLIN: Me?
I don't have a problem.

449
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,807
Oh, OK.

450
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,433
- Denial.
- Aah!

451
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,310
BRUCE: Just start
with your name.

452
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,021
OK. Uh, hello.

453
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:56,191
My name is Marlin.
I'm a clownfish.

454
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:59,236
- A clownfish? Really?
- Tell us a joke.

455
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:01,029
I love jokes.

456
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:04,032
I actually do know one
that's pretty good.

457
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,118
There was this mollusk...

458
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,495
and he walks up
to a sea cucumber.

459
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,372
Normally, they don't talk,
sea cucumbers...

460
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:12,374
but in a joke,
everyone talks...

461
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,460
so the sea mollusk
says to the cucumber...

462
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:19,756
NEMO: Daddy!

463
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,133
Nemo!

464
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:24,219
Nemo! Ha ha! Nemo!
I don't get it.

465
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,138
For a clownfish,
he's not that funny.

466
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,015
No, no, no, no.
He's my son.

467
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,100
He was taken by these divers.

468
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:32,853
DORY: Oh, my. You poor fish.

469
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:34,855
Humans... think they own
everything.

470
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:36,148
Probably American.

471
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,191
Now, there is a father...
Looking for his little boy.

472
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,319
Now, there is a father...
Looking for his little boy.

473
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,863
MARLIN: What do
these markings mean?

474
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,240
I never knew my father!

475
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,659
- Group hug.
- We're all mates here, mate.

476
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:48,911
I can't read human.

477
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,245
DORY: We got to find a fish
that can read this.

478
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,247
- Hey, look, sharks.
- No, no, no, Dory!

479
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,416
- Guys, guys.
- No, Dory.

480
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,751
That's mine.
Give it to me.

481
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,294
Gimme! Ow!

482
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:59,296
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you OK?

483
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,714
- Ow, ow, ow.
- I'm so sorry.

484
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,883
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?

485
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:04,801
- Ohh.
- Ow, ow, ow.

486
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:08,430
Dory, are you OK... Ohh.

487
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:09,264
Ohh, that's good.

488
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:11,975
Ohh, that's good.

489
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,936
BOTH: Intervention!

490
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,563
- Just a bite.
- Hold it together, mate!

491
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:19,233
Remember, Bruce,
fish are friends, not food!

492
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:21,360
- Food!
- Dory, look out!

493
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,152
- Food!
- Dory, look out!

494
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:25,781
- Aah!
- I'm having fish tonight!

495
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,407
Remember the steps, mate!

496
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,952
MARLIN: Aah!

497
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:33,163
- Aah! Whoa!
- Aah!

498
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:35,457
- Just one bite!
- Aah!

499
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:42,297
G'day. Grr!

500
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,633
There's no way out!

501
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:46,426
There's got to be a way
to escape!

502
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:49,972
Who is it?

503
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,306
Dory, help me
find a way out!

504
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,892
Sorry. Come back later.
We're trying to escape.

505
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:58,480
- There's got to be a way out!
- Here's something.

506
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:01,275
"Es-cap-e."
I wonder what that means.

507
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:02,818
Funny. It's spelled
just like "escape."

508
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,152
- Let's go.
- Aah!

509
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:07,281
Here's Brucey!

510
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:08,991
Wait a minute.
You can read?

511
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,034
I can read?
That's right. I can read!

512
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:13,203
Well, then, here.
Read this now.

513
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:15,205
- Aah!
- Ohh!

514
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:18,000
He really doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.

515
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,293
CHUM:
Don't fall off the wagon!

516
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:20,878
- Aah!
- Aah!

517
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,799
Oh, no, it's blocked!

518
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:25,966
Oh, no, it's blocked!

519
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,346
No, Bruce, focus.

520
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,515
Sorry about Bruce, mate.

521
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:36,185
He's really a nice guy.

522
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:37,477
I need to get that mask.

523
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,104
You want that mask? OK.

524
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,899
No, no, no, no, no, no!

525
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,484
Quick, grab the mask!

526
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:51,200
Oh, no. Bruce?

527
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,868
What?

528
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:57,414
Swim away! Swim away!

529
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:59,208
DORY:
Aw, is the party over?

530
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,469
Nice.

531
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:14,723
Dad?

532
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,769
Daddy?

533
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,189
Huh?

534
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:26,568
Aah! Uhh!

535
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:30,280
Uhh!

536
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,544
- Barbara.
- Uh-huh?

537
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,420
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

538
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,881
And I'm going to need
a few more cotton rolls.

539
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:49,550
BARBARA: OK.

540
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,053
Hello, little fella.

541
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:54,263
Aah!

542
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,472
Heh heh heh!
Beauty, isn't he?

543
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,849
I found that guy
struggling for life...

544
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,559
out on the reef,
and I saved him.

545
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,727
So, has that Novocaine
kicked in yet?

546
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:03,939
PATIENT: I think so.
We're ready to roll.

547
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,692
Bubbles!

548
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:11,280
My bubbles.

549
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:12,698
He likes bubbles.

550
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:16,410
Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!

551
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:25,419
- Bonjour.
- Aah!

552
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,256
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

553
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:32,551
- He's scared to death.
- I want to go home.

554
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:34,595
Do you know where my dad is?

555
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:37,431
Honey, your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

556
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:38,599
Pet store?

557
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,351
Yeah, you know, like,
I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

558
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:42,936
- Pet Palace.
- Fish-O-Rama.

559
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:44,479
- Mail order.
- Ebay.

560
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,191
- So, which one is it?
- I'm from the ocean.

561
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,151
Ah, the ocean. The ocean?

562
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:51,111
Aah! Aah! Aah!

563
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:53,822
He hasn't been decontaminated.
Jacques!

564
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:55,199
- Oui.
- Clean him!

565
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,742
Oui.

566
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:59,244
- Ocean.
- Ooh, la mer. Bon.

567
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,207
Voila. He is clean.

568
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:08,962
Wow. The big blue.
What's it like?

569
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:13,008
- Big and blue?
- I knew it.

570
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,261
If there's anything you need,
just ask your Auntie Deb.

571
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:19,389
Or if I'm not around,
you can talk to my sister Flo.

572
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:21,183
Hi. How are you?

573
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:22,768
Don't listen to anything
my sister says.

574
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,645
She's nuts.
Ha ha ha ha!

575
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:25,771
We got a live one.

576
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,815
- Can't hear you, Peach.
- I said we got a live one.

577
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,859
- Boy, oh, boy.
- What do we got?

578
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,402
Root canal... and by the looks
of those x-rays...

579
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:33,904
it's not going to be pretty.

580
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:35,656
Ow!

581
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,115
- Dam and clamp installed?
- Yep.

582
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:38,951
- What did he use to open?
- Gator-Glidden drill.

583
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,661
He seems to favor
that one lately.

584
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:43,622
I can't see, Flo.

585
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,791
You're getting
a little too... Aah!

586
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,000
PEACH: Now he's doing
the Schilder technique.

587
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,460
BLOAT: He's using
a Hedstrom file.

588
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:50,671
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

589
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:53,340
It has a teardrop cross-section.
Clearly a Hedstrom.

590
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:54,883
- No, no, K-Flex.
- Hedstrom.

591
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,635
- K-Flex!
- Hedstrom!

592
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:58,720
There I go.
A little help, over here.

593
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:00,639
DEB: I'll go deflate him.

594
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,227
DENTIST: All right.
Go ahead and rinse.

595
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:08,605
Oh, the human mouth
is a disgusting place.

596
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,985
- Hey, Nigel.
- What did I miss?

597
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:14,194
PEACH: Root canal... a doozy.

598
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:15,863
Root canal?
What did he use to open?

599
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,906
- Gator-Glidden drill.
- He's favoring that one.

600
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:20,951
Hope he doesn't get surplus
sealer at the portal terminus.

601
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:24,079
- Hello. Who's this?
- New guy. Ha ha ha!

602
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:25,455
The dentist
took him off the reef.

603
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,875
An outie. From my neck
of the woods, eh?

604
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,376
Sorry if I ever took
a snap at you.

605
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:30,836
Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta eat.

606
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:32,546
Hey! No, no, no, no!

607
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:34,173
They're not your fish.
They're my fish.

608
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:37,050
Come on, go.
Go on, shoo!

609
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,053
Aw, the picture broke.

610
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:42,139
This here's Darla.
She's my niece.

611
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:43,640
She's going to be
eight this week.

612
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:45,142
Hey, little fella.

613
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,935
Say hello
to your new mummy.

614
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:49,438
She'll be here Friday
to pick you up.

615
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,315
You're her present.
Shh, shh, shh.

616
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:53,400
It's our little secret.

617
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:54,985
Well, Mr. Tucker,
while that sets up...

618
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:56,987
I'm going to see a man
about a wallaby.

619
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:00,741
Oh, Darla.

620
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,618
What?
What's wrong with her?

621
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:05,370
GURGLE: She wouldn't stop
shaking the bag.

622
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:09,166
- Poor Chuckles.
- He was her present last year.

623
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,585
BLOAT: Hitched a ride
on the porcelain express.

624
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:15,631
PEACH: She's a fish killer.

625
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:17,925
I can't go with that girl.

626
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,760
I have to get back
to my dad.

627
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:23,680
Aah! Daddy! Help me!

628
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:24,890
Oh, he's stuck.

629
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:27,100
GILL: Nobody touch him.

630
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:31,355
Nobody touch him.

631
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,529
Can you help me?

632
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:38,946
No. You got yourself
in there.

633
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:40,572
No. You got yourself
in there.

634
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:42,282
You can get yourself out.

635
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:44,576
- Gill...
- I want to see him do it.

636
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:48,455
Calm down. Alternate wiggling
your fins and your tail.

637
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:51,291
I can't. I have a bad fin.

638
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,460
Never stopped me.

639
00:29:57,548 --> 00:30:00,133
Just think about
what you need to do.

640
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:05,597
Come on.

641
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:11,019
Perfect.

642
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:12,437
- Yay!
- You did it!

643
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,231
Good squirming.
Ha ha ha!

644
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:17,860
Wow. From the ocean...
just like you, Gill.

645
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,069
Yeah.

646
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:21,488
I've seen that look before.

647
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,157
What are you thinking about?

648
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:24,992
I'm thinking...

649
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:28,579
tonight, we give the kid
a proper reception.

650
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,289
So, kid,
you got a name or what?

651
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,000
Nemo. I'm Nemo.

652
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:37,629
Nemo. Nemo.

653
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:44,511
DORY: Are you gonna eat that?

654
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:59,735
- Careful with that hammer.
- Huh?

655
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:05,032
No, no.

656
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,284
What does it say? Dory!

657
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:08,952
DORY:
A sea monkey has my money.

658
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:11,246
Wake up. Get up. Come on.

659
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:12,247
Come on!

660
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:14,541
- Yes, I'm a natural blue.
- Get up!

661
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:17,794
DORY: Look out!
Sharks eat fish! Aah!

662
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:23,884
- Aah!
- Aah!

663
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:32,017
Aah!

664
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,944
DORY: Wow. Dusty.

665
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,529
MARLIN: The mask.
Where's the mask?

666
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:47,074
No! No, not the mask!

667
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,660
Get it! Get the mask!
Get the mask! Get it!

668
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:56,333
DORY: * Hoo doot doo doot
doot doo doot *

669
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,751
Whoo-hoo!

670
00:31:57,793 --> 00:31:59,378
* La la la la la la *

671
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,129
It just keeps going on,
doesn't it?

672
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:03,590
Echo! Echo!

673
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:04,842
Hey, what you doing?

674
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:06,134
It's gone.
I've lost the mask.

675
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,220
- Did you drop it?
- You dropped it!

676
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,847
That was my only chance
of finding my son.

677
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:12,182
Now it's gone.

678
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,647
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills...

679
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:20,274
when life gets you down,
know what you got to do?

680
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:22,776
- I don't want to know.
- Just keep swimming.

681
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:26,238
* Just keep swimming,
swimming, swimming *

682
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,490
* What do we do?
We swim, swim *

683
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:29,783
Dory, no singing.

684
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:31,618
* Ho ho ho ho ho ho *

685
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,246
* I love to swim *

686
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:36,707
* When you want to swim *

687
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:38,750
See, I'm going to get
stuck now with that song.

688
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:43,005
- Now it's in my head.
- Sorry.

689
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:44,464
Dory, do you see anything?

690
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:46,216
- Aah! Something's got me.
- That was me. I'm sorry.

691
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:49,636
- Who's that?
- Who could it be? It's me.

692
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:52,931
DORY: Are you my conscience?

693
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:55,601
MARLIN: Yeah, yeah.
I'm your conscience.

694
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:58,520
We haven't spoken for a while.
How are you?

695
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:00,814
- Can't complain.
- Yeah? Good.

696
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:02,608
Now, Dory,
I want you to tell me...

697
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,359
Do you see anything?

698
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:07,988
I see a... I see a light.

699
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,616
- A light?
- Yeah. Over there.

700
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:14,119
- Hey, conscience, am I dead?
- No. I see it, too.

701
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:23,795
What is it?

702
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:28,634
It's so pretty.

703
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:33,472
I'm feeling... happy...

704
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:36,975
which is a big deal for me.

705
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:38,519
I want to touch it.

706
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,103
- Oh.
- Ooh.

707
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:42,523
Hey, come back.
Come on back here.

708
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:44,149
* I'm gonna get you *

709
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:45,943
I'm gonna get you.

710
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,236
* I'm gonna swim with you *

711
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:48,654
I'm gonna get you.

712
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:51,532
* I'm gonna be
your best friend *

713
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:52,741
Good feeling's gone.

714
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,037
- Whoa!
- Waah!

715
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:02,376
MARLIN: I can't see!
I don't know where I'm going!

716
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:03,377
DORY: Haah!

717
00:34:03,377 --> 00:34:04,211
DORY: Haah!

718
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:06,255
- The mask!
- What mask?

719
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:08,549
OK, I can't see a thing.

720
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:12,261
- Oh, gee.
- Hey, look, a mask.

721
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:13,971
Read it!

722
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:15,639
DORY: I'm sorry,
but if you could just...

723
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:17,224
bring it a little closer,
I kind of need the light.

724
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:17,599
Bring it a little closer,
I kind of need the light.

725
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:20,561
That's great.
Keep it right there.

726
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:23,355
- Just read it!
- OK, OK.

727
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:26,400
Mr. Bossy. Uh, "P."

728
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:29,444
OK. "P. Sher..."

729
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:32,573
"Sher... P. Sher..."
P. Shirley? P..."

730
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,743
Oh. The first line's
"P. Sherman."

731
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:38,996
"P. Sherman"
doesn't make any sense!

732
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,248
DORY: OK. Second line. "42."

733
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,292
MARLIN: Don't eat me.
Don't eat me. Aah!

734
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:46,587
DORY: Light, please!

735
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:50,549
DORY: "Walla... walla..."

736
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:53,468
MARLIN: Waah! Waah! Waah!

737
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,262
DORY: The second line's
"42 Wallaby Way."

738
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:58,098
MARLIN: That's great.
Speed read. Take a guess.

739
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,766
No pressure. No problem.
There's a lot of pressure.

740
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:02,352
Pressure! Take a guess
now with pressure!

741
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:05,480
- "Sydney"! It's "Sydney"!
- Duck!

742
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:07,441
DORY: Aah!

743
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:10,903
MARLIN: I'm dead.
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

744
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:12,279
I died. I'm dead.

745
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:20,621
Whoo-hoo!

746
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:22,456
* We did it, we did it *

747
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:24,208
* Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah *

748
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:26,084
* No eating here
tonight, whoo! *

749
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,461
BO TH:
* Eating here tonight *

750
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:28,795
* No, no, no,
eating here tonight *

751
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,297
- Dory.
- * You on a diet *

752
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:33,175
Dory!
What did the mask say?

753
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:35,052
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

754
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:37,221
I remembered what it said!

755
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:39,765
I usually forget things,
but I remembered it!

756
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,475
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Where is that?

757
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:43,936
I don't know.
But who cares? I remembered.

758
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,145
- Raar!
- Aah!

759
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:47,439
DORY: P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

760
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:49,483
I remembered it again!

761
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:19,179
JACQUES: Psst. Nemo.

762
00:36:19,221 --> 00:36:20,806
NEMO: Mmm...

763
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:23,559
* Nemo *

764
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,478
- Huh?
- Suivez-moi.

765
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:30,190
Follow me.

766
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:42,786
FISH: * Ha hwa ha *

767
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:45,747
* Ha hwa ha *

768
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:47,666

787
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:29,458
State your name.

788
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,585
Nemo.

789
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,962
Brother Bloat, proceed.

790
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:39,009
Nemo, newcomer
of orange and white...

791
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:40,427
you have been called forth...

792
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:43,013
to the summit of
Mount Wannahockaloogie...

793
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:48,352
to join with us in
the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

794
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:51,271
- Huh?
- We want you in our club, kid.

795
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:52,523
- Really?
- Lf...

796
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:55,818
you are able to swim through...

797
00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:00,322
The Ring of Fire!

798
00:38:03,826 --> 00:38:05,661
Turn on the Ring of Fire!

799
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,329
You said you could do it.

800
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:08,956
The Ring of Fire!

801
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:13,460
Bubbles, let me... Oh!

802
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:16,296
* Ha hwa ha ho ho ho *

803
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:18,632
* Ha hwa ha ho ho ho *

804
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:21,009
* Ha hwa ha ho ho ho *

805
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:24,137
Isn't there another way?
He's just a boy!

806
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:39,653
From this moment on,
you will be known as Sharkbait.

807
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:40,988
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

808
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:42,823
Welcome,
Brother Sharkbait.

809
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:44,074
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

810
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,118
- Enough with the Sharkbait.
- Sharkbait!

811
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:48,036
Ooh... ba-ba-do.

812
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:49,621
Sharkbait's
one of us now, agreed?

813
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:51,748
- Agreed.
- We can't send him to his death.

814
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,876
Darla's coming in five days.

815
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,460
So, what are we going to do?

816
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:58,088
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do...

817
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,673
we're gonna get him
out of here.

818
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:02,259
- We'll help him escape.
- Escape? Really?

819
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:03,760
We're all gonna escape.

820
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:06,430
Gill, please.
Not another escape plan.

821
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:08,473
Sorry,
but they just never work.

822
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:09,683
Why should this
be any different?

823
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:10,058
Why should this
be any different?

824
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,562
- Because we've got him.
- Me?

825
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,397
- You see that filter?
- Yeah.

826
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:18,817
You're the only one who can get
in and out of that thing.

827
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,029
We need you to take
a pebble inside there...

828
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,280
and jam the gears.

829
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:25,282
You do that,
and this tank's gonna get...

830
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:27,284
filthier and filthier
by the minute.

831
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:29,661
Pretty soon, the dentist'll
have to clean the tank...

832
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:32,581
and when he does, he'll take us
out of the tank...

833
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:34,166
put us in
individual baggies...

834
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:36,043
then we'll roll ourselves
down the counter...

835
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:37,711
out the window,
off the awning...

836
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:39,421
into the bushes,
across the street...

837
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:41,924
and into the harbor!

838
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:44,885
It's foolproof.
Who's with me?

839
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:46,345
- Aye!
- Aye!

840
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:47,804
I think you're nuts.

841
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:51,808
No offense, kid,
but you're not the best swimmer.

842
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,228
He's fine. He can do this.

843
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:57,731
So, Sharkbait,
what do you think?

844
00:39:57,773 --> 00:40:02,736
Let's do it.

845
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:05,697
DORY: I'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

846
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,032
Where are you going?

847
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:08,742
I'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

848
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:10,410
If you ask
where I'm going...

849
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:12,162
I'll tell you
that's where I'm going.

850
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:13,664
It's P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

851
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:15,457
Where? I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you.

852
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:17,042
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

853
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,920
MARLIN: Excuse me.

854
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:21,755
Hi.
Do you know how to get...

855
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:24,758
Hello? Whoa. Wait.
Can you tell me...

856
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,096
Hey! Hold it!
I'm trying to talk to you!

857
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:32,516
Fellas, come back here.
One quick question.

858
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:36,937
I need to...
And they're gone again.

859
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:38,772
DORY: P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

860
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:40,440
Why do I have to tell you
over and over again?

861
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:42,484
I'll tell you again.
I don't get tired of it...

862
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:43,694
- OK, all right.
- Huh?

863
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:45,445
- Here's the thing.
- Uh-huh.

864
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:50,951
I think it's best
if I carry on from here by...

865
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:52,369
by myself.

866
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:53,620
OK.

867
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:55,330
- You know, alone.
- Uh-huh.

868
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:57,416
Without... without...
I mean, not without you.

869
00:40:57,457 --> 00:41:00,794
But I don't
want you... with me.

870
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:03,172
- Huh?
- Am I...

871
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:04,381
I don't want to hurt
your feelings.

872
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:07,217
- You want me to leave?
- I mean, not... Yes.

873
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:09,678
I just can't afford
any more delays...

874
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,931
and you're one of those fish
that cause delays.

875
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,600
Sometimes it's a good thing.

876
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:17,644
There's a whole group of fish.
They're delay fish.

877
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:19,271
You mean...

878
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:20,981
You mean you don't like me?

879
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:22,816
No, of course I like you.

880
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:25,527
It's because I like you
I don't want to be with you.

881
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:27,738
It's a complicated emotion.

882
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:31,492
- Ohh!
- Don't cry. I like you.

883
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:35,871
Hey, you!
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

884
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:37,831
Um... I don't remember.
Were you?

885
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:39,791
No, no, no, no, no.
We're just...

886
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,585
Do you guys know
how I can get to...

887
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:43,962
Look, pal, we're talking
to the lady, not you.

888
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:45,589
Hey, hey.
You like impressions?

889
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:47,633
Mm-hmm.

890
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:50,010
Just like in rehearsals,
gentlemen.

891
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:51,637
So what are we?
Take a guess.

892
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:52,971
DORY: Oh, oh.
I've seen one of those.

893
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:55,182
I'm a fish with a nose
like a sword.

894
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:57,184
- Wait, wait, um...
- It's a swordfish!

895
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:59,019
LEADER: Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

896
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,270
LEADER: Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

897
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:01,855
Where's the butter?

898
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:03,315
Ooh! It's on
the tip of my tongue!

899
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:05,317
- Lobster.
- Saw that!

900
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,194
Lots of legs!
Live in the ocean.

901
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:08,654
- Clam!
- Close enough!

902
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,155
* Oh, it's a whale
of a tale *

903
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,698
* I'll tell you, lad... *

904
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,699
They're good.

905
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:14,034
Will somebody please
give me directions?!

906
00:42:14,076 --> 00:42:16,453
"Will somebody please
give me directions?!"

907
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:18,497
- Ha ha ha ha ha!
- I'm serious!

908
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,541
"Blah blah blah,
me, me, blah!

909
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:21,792
"Blah blah blah,
me, me, me!"

910
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,335
Thank you.

911
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:25,838
Oh, dear. Hey!
Hey, come back!

912
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:28,048
- Hey, what's the matter?
- What's the matter?

913
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:28,549
- Hey, what's the matter?
- What's the matter?

914
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,551
While they're doing their
silly little impressions...

915
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:34,721
I am miles from home with a fish
that can't remember her name!

916
00:42:34,763 --> 00:42:36,056
I bet that's frustrating.

917
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:37,558
Meanwhile,
my son is out there.

918
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,560
- Your son Chico?
- Nemo?

919
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:41,019
But it doesn't matter
because no fish...

920
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:43,021
in this entire ocean
is going to help me.

921
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:46,817
Well, I'm helping you.

922
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,193
Wait right here.

923
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:52,030
- Guys!
- Is he bothering you again?

924
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:53,574
No, no. He's a good guy.

925
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:54,616
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

926
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:55,868
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

927
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:58,745
Any of you heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

928
00:42:58,871 --> 00:43:01,498
Sydney? Oh, sure!

929
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,250
Ted here's got relatives
in Sydney.

930
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:04,918
- Don't you, Ted?
- Sure do!

931
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,461
Oh! Hey!
They know Sydney!

932
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:09,214
You wouldn't know how
to get there, would you?

933
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:11,216
You want to follow the E.A.C.

934
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:13,927
That's the East
Australian Current.

935
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:15,596
Big current.
Can't miss it.

936
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:18,599
It's in... that direction.

937
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,559
And then you follow that
for about...

938
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:22,352
I don't know.
What do you guys think?

939
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:23,562
About three leagues?

940
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:26,565
That little baby will put you
right past Sydney.

941
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:29,026
- Ta-da!
- That's great!

942
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:30,277
Dory, you did it!

943
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,112
Oh, please,
I'm just your little helper.

944
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:34,490
- Helping along. That's me.
- Fellas, thank you.

945
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:38,160
LEADER: Don't mention it!
Just loosen up, OK, buddy?

946
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:41,205
DORY: Oh, you guys.
You really nailed him. Bye.

947
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:43,081
LEADER: Oh, hey, ma'am.
One more thing.

948
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:46,668
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

949
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,629
DORY: Trench...
through it, not over it.

950
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:51,340
I'll remember. Hey, hey!

951
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:55,052
Hey, wait up, partner!
Hold on!

952
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:57,804
Wait, wait, wait!
I gotta tell you something.

953
00:43:57,846 --> 00:44:00,557
Whoa.

954
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,893
DORY: Nice trench.

955
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:07,606
DORY: Hello!

956
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:12,986
- OK, let's go.
- No, no. Bad trench.

957
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,655
Come on, we'll swim over
this thing.

958
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:16,824
Whoa, partner.
Little red flag going up.

959
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:20,494
Something's telling me
to swim through it, not over it.

960
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:22,162
Are you looking at this thing?

961
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:23,705
It's got death
written all over it.

962
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:26,583
I really, really, really
think we should swim through.

963
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,836
And I'm really, really done
talking about this. Over we go.

964
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:30,838
- Trust me on this.
- Trust you?

965
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:32,756
Yes, trust.
It's what friends do.

966
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:34,675
Look! Something shiny!

967
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:36,510
- Where?
- It just swam over the trench.

968
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:42,224
- Come on, we'll follow it!
- OK!

969
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:44,893
Boy, it sure is clear up here.

970
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:48,397
Exactly. And look at that...
there's the current.

971
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:51,024
We should be there in no time.

972
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:52,860
Hey, little guy.

973
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:54,695
You wanted to go
through the trench.

974
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:56,738
I shall call him Squishy,
and he shall be mine.

975
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,949
And he shall be my Squishy.
Come here, Squishy.

976
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:00,492
Come here, little Squishy.

977
00:45:02,286 --> 00:45:03,537
Ow!

978
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:06,415
- That's a jellyfish!
- Bad Squishy!

979
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:08,250
Shoo, shoo! Get away!

980
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:10,586
- Let me see that.
- Don't touch it.

981
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:12,963
I won't touch it.
I just want to look.

982
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:15,007
Hey! How come
it didn't sting you?

983
00:45:15,048 --> 00:45:16,592
It did.
It's just that...

984
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:18,343
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Hold still.

985
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:19,845
I live in this anemone...

986
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,722
and I'm used
to these kind of stings.

987
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:22,931
Ow! Ow! Ow!

988
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:24,975
It doesn't look bad.
You'll be fine.

989
00:45:25,017 --> 00:45:26,727
But now we know, don't we...

990
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:28,979
that we don't want
to touch these again.

991
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:32,024
Let's be thankful this time
it was just a little one.

992
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:34,485
- Aah!
- Aah!

993
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:35,777
Don't move.

994
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:38,447
- This is bad, Dory.
- Hey, watch this!

995
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:40,532
- This is bad, Dory.
- Hey, watch this!

996
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:42,242
Boing! Boing!

997
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:43,494
Dory!

998
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:45,871
* You can't catch me *

999
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:47,372
Don't bounce on the tops!

1000
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:50,542
They will... not sting you!

1001
00:45:50,584 --> 00:45:53,253
- The tops don't sting you!
- Two in a row! Beat that!

1002
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:56,215
Dory, listen to me.
I have an idea... a game.

1003
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:57,716
- A game?
- Yes.

1004
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:00,469
- I love games! Pick me!
- Here's the game.

1005
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:03,972
Whoever can hop the fastest
out of these jellyfish wins!

1006
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:05,641
- OK.
- Rules, rules, rules!

1007
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:08,227
You can't touch the tentacles.
Only the tops.

1008
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:10,145
Something about tentacles.
Got it. Go!

1009
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:13,106
Wait! Not something about 'em,
it's all about 'em!

1010
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:14,358
- Whee!
- Wait, Dory!

1011
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:15,108
Gotta go faster
if you want to win!

1012
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:16,485
Gotta go faster
if you want to win!

1013
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:17,694
Whoa! Dory!

1014
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:19,696
Boing, boing, boing!

1015
00:46:19,738 --> 00:46:22,616
Wait a minute! Whoa! Dory!

1016
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:24,159
Whee!

1017
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:27,454
We're cheating death now.
That's what we're doing.

1018
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:29,164
But we're having fun
at the same time.

1019
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:30,624
I can do this.
Just be careful.

1020
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:32,584
Yeah, careful I don't
make you cry when I win!

1021
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:33,794
I don't think so!

1022
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:35,337
Ha ha ha ha!

1023
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:37,172
Whoa!

1024
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:38,382
Give it up, old man.

1025
00:46:38,423 --> 00:46:40,676
You can't fight evolution.
I was built for speed.

1026
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:42,678
The question is, Dory,
are you hungry?

1027
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:44,054
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

1028
00:46:44,096 --> 00:46:46,807
'Cause you're about
to eat my bubbles!

1029
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:49,017
Duck to the left!
Right there!

1030
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:53,814
The clownfish is the winner!

1031
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:56,942
Whoo-hoo! We did it!
Look at us!

1032
00:46:56,984 --> 00:46:58,485
Dory?

1033
00:46:58,485 --> 00:46:58,569
Dory?

1034
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:02,114
Oh, no.

1035
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:05,492
Dory! Dory!

1036
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:07,619
Dory!

1037
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:11,832
Dory!

1038
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,709
Ohh!

1039
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:18,755
DORY: Am I disqualified?

1040
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:20,757
MARLIN: No, you're doing fine!
You're actually winning!

1041
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:23,927
But you gotta stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?

1042
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:26,847
DORY: P. Sherman...
Wallaby Way, Sydney...

1043
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:28,640
MARLIN: That's it!

1044
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:29,850
Uhh!

1045
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:32,603
- Wallaby Way...
- Uhh! Stay awake!

1046
00:47:32,644 --> 00:47:34,938
Stay awake!
Ooh! Stay awake!

1047
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,734
Stay... awake!

1048
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:44,531
- Awake.
- P. Sherman.

1049
00:47:44,573 --> 00:47:47,576
- Awake.
- 42 Wallaby Way.

1050
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:51,163
Wake up. Nemo...

1051
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:51,580
Wake up. Nemo...

1052
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:08,680
You miss your dad,
don't you, Sharkbait?

1053
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,556
Yeah.

1054
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:10,057
Yeah.

1055
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:14,102
You're lucky to have someone
out there looking for you.

1056
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:16,313
He's not looking for me.

1057
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:19,691
He's scared of the ocean.

1058
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:21,318
Peach, any movement?

1059
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,279
He's had four cups of coffee.
It's gotta be soon.

1060
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:25,823
Keep on him.

1061
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:31,078
My first escape...
landed on dental tools.

1062
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,538
I was aiming for the toilet.

1063
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:33,789
Toilet?

1064
00:48:33,831 --> 00:48:36,416
All drains
lead to the ocean, kid.

1065
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:39,711
Wow. How many times have
you tried to get out?

1066
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:41,338
Ah, I've lost count.

1067
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,340
Fish aren't meant
to be in a box, kid.

1068
00:48:43,382 --> 00:48:45,050
It does things to you.

1069
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:47,177
Bubbles! Bubbles!

1070
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:49,596
Potty break! He grabbed
the "Reader's Digest."

1071
00:48:49,638 --> 00:48:53,058
- We have 4.2 minutes!
- That's your cue, Sharkbait.

1072
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,394
- You can do it, kid.
- We gotta be quick.

1073
00:48:55,394 --> 00:48:55,602
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

1074
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:58,063
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

1075
00:48:58,105 --> 00:48:59,857
and I'll talk you
through the rest.

1076
00:48:59,898 --> 00:49:02,693
- OK.
- It'll be a piece of kelp.

1077
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:12,494
Nicely done!

1078
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:14,246
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah!

1079
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:16,790
Here comes the pebble.

1080
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,251
Ptoo.

1081
00:49:21,753 --> 00:49:24,548
Now, do you see
a small opening?

1082
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,008
Uh-huh!

1083
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:29,219
Inside it,
you'll see a rotating fan.

1084
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:33,765
Wedge that pebble into the fan
to stop it turning.

1085
00:49:37,186 --> 00:49:38,478
Aah!

1086
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,814
- Careful, Sharkbait!
- I can't do it!

1087
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:42,399
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

1088
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:44,193
He'll be fine. Try again!

1089
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:46,945
OK.

1090
00:49:46,945 --> 00:49:49,448
GILL: That's it, Sharkbait.

1091
00:49:49,448 --> 00:49:51,783
Nice and steady.

1092
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:55,787
I got it! I got it!

1093
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:58,582
- He did it!
- That's great, kid!

1094
00:49:58,624 --> 00:50:00,792
Now swim up the tube
and out.

1095
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:20,813
Oh, no! Gill!

1096
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:22,064
- Sharkbait!
- Oh, my gosh!

1097
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:23,315
Get him outta there!

1098
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:25,901
- What do we do?
- Oh, no!

1099
00:50:25,943 --> 00:50:27,903
Stay calm, kid.
Just don't panic!

1100
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:30,322
Help me!

1101
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:32,741
Sharkbait, grab hold of this!

1102
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:38,205
- No! No! No!
- Feed me more!

1103
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:41,166
- That's it!
- Sharkbait! Grab it!

1104
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:43,919
I got it!

1105
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:45,754
Pull!

1106
00:50:52,427 --> 00:50:55,138
PEACH: Gill, don't make him
go back in there.

1107
00:50:56,348 --> 00:51:00,394
No. We're done.

1108
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:15,159
CRUSH: Dude.

1109
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,245
- Uhh.
- Dude.

1110
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:22,791
Focus, dude. Dude.

1111
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,459
Ohh.

1112
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:26,086
Oh, he lives.
Hey, dude!

1113
00:51:26,128 --> 00:51:29,506
MARLIN:
Ohh. What happened?

1114
00:51:29,548 --> 00:51:31,592
Saw the whole thing, dude.

1115
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:33,510
First, you were all,
like, "Whoa!"...

1116
00:51:33,552 --> 00:51:35,179
and then we were
all, like, "Whoa!"...

1117
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,097
and then you were,
like, "Whoa."

1118
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:38,557
MARLIN:
What are you talking about?

1119
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:42,060
You, mini-man.
Takin' on the jellies.

1120
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,897
You got serious
thrill issues, dude.

1121
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,231
- Ohh.
- Awesome.

1122
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:49,443
Uhh. Oh, my stomach. Ohh!

1123
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:51,445
Oh, man. No hurlin'
on the shell, dude, OK?

1124
00:51:51,487 --> 00:51:52,696
Just waxed it.

1125
00:51:52,738 --> 00:51:54,948
So, Mr. Turtle...

1126
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,367
Whoa, dude.
Mr. Turtle is my father.

1127
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:58,827
The name's Crush.

1128
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:01,205
Crush? Really?

1129
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:05,918
OK, Crush. I need to
the East Australian Current.

1130
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:07,169
E.A.C.?

1131
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:09,129
Oh, dude.

1132
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:11,548
You're ridin' it, dude!

1133
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:14,218
Check it out!

1134
00:52:35,113 --> 00:52:36,990
OK, grab shell, dude!

1135
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:38,784
Grab wh-a-a-at?!

1136
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:39,368
Grab wh-a-a-at?!

1137
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:50,838
Ha ha! Righteous!
Righteous!

1138
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:55,634
- Yeah!
- Stop!

1139
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:58,095
So...

1140
00:52:58,136 --> 00:53:01,640
What brings you on this fine day
to the E.A.C.?

1141
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:04,268
Dory and I need
to get to Sydney.

1142
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:06,562
Dory!
Is she all right?

1143
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:08,397
Huh? Oh, little blue.

1144
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:11,108
She is sub-level, dude.

1145
00:53:15,237 --> 00:53:17,781
Dory! Dory! Dory!

1146
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:19,575
Dory.

1147
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:24,163
I'm so sorry.

1148
00:53:24,163 --> 00:53:27,499
This is all my fault.
It's my fault.

1149
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:32,504
Twenty-nine, thirty!
Ready or not, here I come!

1150
00:53:32,504 --> 00:53:34,548
There you are!

1151
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:38,677
Catch me if you can!

1152
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:41,096
Dory

1153
00:53:41,138 --> 00:53:42,973
KID: Nice wave!

1154
00:53:43,015 --> 00:53:45,017
Oh, wow!

1155
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:46,727
Heh heh.

1156
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:47,186
Up you go!

1157
00:53:47,186 --> 00:53:48,604
Up you go!

1158
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:51,648
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

1159
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,108
Whoa! Whoa!

1160
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:56,737
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

1161
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,241
- Oh, my goodness!
- Kill the motor, dude.

1162
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:04,620
Let us see what Squirt does
flying solo.

1163
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:13,045
Whoa!

1164
00:54:13,086 --> 00:54:16,089
Whoa! That was so cool!

1165
00:54:16,131 --> 00:54:17,925
Hey, Dad,
did you see that?

1166
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:20,302
Did you see me?
Did you see what I did?

1167
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:23,305
You so totally rock, Squirt!

1168
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:24,848
So give me some fin.

1169
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,308
Noggin.

1170
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,726
- Dude.
- Dude.

1171
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:29,144
Oh... intro.

1172
00:54:29,186 --> 00:54:31,063
Jellyman, offspring.

1173
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:33,190
Offspring, Jellyman.

1174
00:54:33,232 --> 00:54:36,735
- Jellies?! Sweet.
- Totally.

1175
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:40,030
Apparently, I must've done
something you liked... dudes.

1176
00:54:40,072 --> 00:54:42,491
- You rock, dude!
- Ow.

1177
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:47,246
Curl away, my son.
It's awesome, Jellyman.

1178
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:48,956
The little dudes
are just eggs.

1179
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:50,749
We leave 'em
on a beach to hatch...

1180
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:52,084
and then, coo-coo-cachoo...

1181
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:54,503
they find their way back
to the big ol' blue.

1182
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:56,880
- All by themselves?
- Yeah.

1183
00:54:56,922 --> 00:54:59,883
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

1184
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:01,176
Well, you never really know.

1185
00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:04,596
But when they know,
you'll know, you know? Ha.

1186
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:10,269
Hey, look, everybody.

1187
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:13,021
I know that dude!
It's the Jellyman!

1188
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:15,065
DORY: Go on. Jump on him!

1189
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:18,318
- Turtle pile!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1190
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,404
- Are you funny?
- Where's your shell?

1191
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:22,531
- I need to breathe!
- Are you running away?

1192
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:24,241
Did you really cross
the jellyfish forest?

1193
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:26,243
- Did they sting you?
- One at a time!

1194
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:27,911
Mr. Fish, did you die?

1195
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:30,497
DORY: Sorry, I was
a little vague on the details.

1196
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:31,707
So, where are you going?

1197
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:33,625
You see, my son was taken.

1198
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:36,461
My son was taken away from me.

1199
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:38,797
- No way.
- What happened?

1200
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:40,966
No, no, kids.
I don't want to talk about it.

1201
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:43,343
ALL: Aww! Please?

1202
00:55:43,385 --> 00:55:44,720
Please?

1203
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:47,472
Well, OK.

1204
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:51,310
I live on this reef
a long, long way from here.

1205
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:53,395
This is gonna be good.
I can tell.

1206
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:55,814
And my son Nemo...

1207
00:55:55,856 --> 00:55:57,816
See, he was mad at me.

1208
00:55:57,858 --> 00:55:59,485
And maybe he wouldn't
have done it...

1209
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:01,028
if I hadn't been
so tough on him.

1210
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:02,321
I don't know.

1211
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:04,323
Anyway, he swam out in
the open water to this boat...

1212
00:56:04,364 --> 00:56:07,242
and when he was out there,
these divers appeared...

1213
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:09,912
and I tried to stop them,
but the boat was too fast.

1214
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:11,705
So, we swam out in the ocean
to follow them...

1215
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:14,082
They couldn't stop 'em.
And then Nemo's dad...

1216
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:16,877
he swims out to the ocean,
and they bump into...

1217
00:56:16,919 --> 00:56:18,212
...three ferocious sharks.

1218
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:20,339
He scares away the sharks
by blowing 'em up!

1219
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,715
Golly, that's amazing.

1220
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:23,383
And then dives
thousands of feet...

1221
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:25,177
...straight down
into the dark.

1222
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:26,678
It's wicked dark down there.

1223
00:56:26,678 --> 00:56:28,388
You can't see a thing.
How's it going, Bob?

1224
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:30,098
And the only thing
they can see down there...

1225
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,850
...is the light from
this big, horrible creature...

1226
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:33,852
with razor-sharp teeth.
Nice parry, old man.

1227
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:35,270
And then he has
to blast his way...

1228
00:56:35,312 --> 00:56:36,939
So, these two little fish
have been...

1229
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,526
searching the ocean for days
on the East Australian Current.

1230
00:56:40,526 --> 00:56:42,861
Which means that he may be
on his way here right now.

1231
00:56:42,861 --> 00:56:44,404
That should put him
in Sydney Harbor...

1232
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:45,739
...in a matter of days.
I mean, it sounds like...

1233
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:47,783
this guy is gonna
stop at nothing...

1234
00:56:47,825 --> 00:56:50,577
...till he finds his son.
I sure hope he makes it.

1235
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:53,622
That's one dedicated father,
if you ask me.

1236
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:01,171
GULLS: Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1237
00:57:01,213 --> 00:57:06,510
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1238
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:08,220
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1239
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:11,682
Would you just shut up?!

1240
00:57:11,723 --> 00:57:13,183
You're rats with wings!

1241
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:14,685
Bloke's been looking
for his boy Nemo.

1242
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:17,062
- Nemo?!
- He was taken off the reef...

1243
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:20,149
- Take it! You happy?
- Mine! Mine! Mine!

1244
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:22,985
Hey, say that again!
Something about Nemo.

1245
00:57:23,026 --> 00:57:24,194
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1246
00:57:24,236 --> 00:57:25,696
Whoooa...

1247
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:26,905
Hyah!

1248
00:57:26,947 --> 00:57:28,532
Mine?

1249
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:30,784
Last I heard, he's heading
towards the harbor.

1250
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:33,245
Ho ho! Brilliant!

1251
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:47,634
Is he doing OK?

1252
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:48,177
Is he doing OK?

1253
00:57:48,218 --> 00:57:51,430
Whatever you do,
Don't mention D-a-r...

1254
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:54,308
It's OK. I know who
you're talking about.

1255
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:03,650
Gill?

1256
00:58:06,111 --> 00:58:07,863
Gill?

1257
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:10,574
Hey, Sharkbait.

1258
00:58:10,616 --> 00:58:12,826
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the...

1259
00:58:12,868 --> 00:58:15,037
No, I'm the one
who should be sorry.

1260
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:17,706
I was so ready
to get out...

1261
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:20,501
so ready to taste that ocean...

1262
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:23,962
I was willing to put you
in harm's way to get there.

1263
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:27,966
Nothing should be worth that.

1264
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:31,261
I'm sorry I couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

1265
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:37,851
All right.
Hey, hey, hey...

1266
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:39,520
- What the...
- Aaah!

1267
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:43,315
That's one way to pull a tooth.

1268
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:45,442
Huh. Darn kids.

1269
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:48,445
Good thing I pulled the
right one, eh, Prime Minister?

1270
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:50,072
NIGEL: Hey, psst!

1271
00:58:50,113 --> 00:58:52,115
PEACH: Oh, Nigel!
You just missed an extraction.

1272
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:54,785
Has he loosened
the periodontal ligament yet?

1273
00:58:54,827 --> 00:58:56,870
What am I talking about?
Where's Nemo?

1274
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:59,248
- I've got to speak with him.
- What is it?

1275
00:58:59,289 --> 00:59:01,375
Your dad's been fighting
the entire ocean...

1276
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:04,044
- Iooking for you.
- My father? Really?

1277
00:59:04,086 --> 00:59:08,215
He's traveled hundreds of miles,
battling sharks and jellyfish...

1278
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:10,759
Sharks? That can't be him.

1279
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:13,387
What was his name?
Some sort of sport fish.

1280
00:59:13,428 --> 00:59:15,597
- Tuna? Trout?
- Marlin?

1281
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:17,474
Marlin! The little clownfish
from the reef.

1282
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:20,102
It's my dad!
He took on a shark!

1283
00:59:20,144 --> 00:59:22,479
I heard he took on three.

1284
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:25,357
- Three sharks?
- That's 4,800 teeth!

1285
00:59:25,357 --> 00:59:27,484
After you were taken
by Diver Dan over there...

1286
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:29,736
your dad followed the boat
like a maniac.

1287
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:31,155
Really?

1288
00:59:31,196 --> 00:59:32,990
He's swimming,
giving it all he's got...

1289
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:35,075
and then three gigantic
sharks capture him...

1290
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:37,369
and he blows them up
and dives thousands of feet...

1291
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:40,247
and gets chased by a monster
with huge teeth!

1292
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:42,916
He ties this demon to a rock,
and what's his reward?

1293
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:45,335
He gets to battle
an entire jellyfish forest!

1294
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:48,547
Now he's with a bunch of
sea turtles on the E.A. C...

1295
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:52,092
and the word is he's headed
this way right now... to Sydney!

1296
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:53,510
- Wow!
- What a good daddy!

1297
00:59:53,552 --> 00:59:56,096
He was looking for you
after all, Sharkbait.

1298
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,226
GURGLE:
He's swimming to the filter!

1299
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:02,769
- Sharkbait!
- Not again!

1300
01:00:04,313 --> 01:00:07,232
Sharkbait!

1301
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:08,650
No!

1302
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:09,902
You got your whole life
ahead of you!

1303
01:00:09,902 --> 01:00:12,321
- We'll help you, kid!
- Get him out!

1304
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:18,285
Get him out of there!

1305
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:19,953
Come on, kid!
Grab the end!

1306
01:00:19,995 --> 01:00:22,581
Sharkbait!

1307
01:00:22,623 --> 01:00:24,666
- No!
- Can you hear me?

1308
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,210
Nemo! Can you hear me?

1309
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:28,253
Yeah, I can hear you.

1310
01:00:28,295 --> 01:00:30,255
Sharkbait, you did it!

1311
01:00:30,255 --> 01:00:34,092
Sharkbait, you're...
covered with germs! Aah!

1312
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:36,178
Ha ha!
That took guts, kid.

1313
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:38,680
All right, gang,
we have less than 48 hours...

1314
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:40,015
before Darla gets here.

1315
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:41,767
This tank'll get
plenty dirty in that time...

1316
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:44,603
but we have to help it along
any way we can.

1317
01:00:44,645 --> 01:00:46,939
- Jacques? No cleaning.
- I shall resist.

1318
01:00:46,939 --> 01:00:49,608
Everybody else,
be as gross as possible.

1319
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:50,901
Think dirty thoughts.

1320
01:00:50,943 --> 01:00:53,111
We're gonna make
this tank so filthy...

1321
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:55,697
the dentist
will have to clean it.

1322
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:57,825
- Good work!
- Ha ha ha!

1323
01:01:04,373 --> 01:01:06,917
All right, we're here, dudes!

1324
01:01:06,959 --> 01:01:10,128
Get ready!
Your exit's coming up, man!

1325
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:11,672
MARLIN:
Where? I don't see it!

1326
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:14,132
DORY: Right there!
I see it! I see it!

1327
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:17,302
MARLIN:
The swirling vortex of terror?

1328
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:19,638
- That's it, dude.
- Of course it is.

1329
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,725
OK, first,
find your exit buddy.

1330
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:26,270
Do you have your exit buddy?

1331
01:01:26,311 --> 01:01:27,521
Yes!

1332
01:01:27,563 --> 01:01:32,317
Squirt give you a rundown
of proper exiting technique.

1333
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:35,863
Good afternoon!
We'll have a great jump today!

1334
01:01:35,904 --> 01:01:39,616
OK, crank a hard cutback
as you hit the wall.

1335
01:01:39,658 --> 01:01:42,578
There's a screaming bottom turn,
so watch out!

1336
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:45,873
Remember...
rip it, roll it, and punch it!

1337
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:49,042
He's trying to speak to me,
I know it!

1338
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:52,337
You're really cute, but I don't
know what you're saying!

1339
01:01:52,337 --> 01:01:53,630
Say the first thing again.

1340
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:56,175
OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!

1341
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:04,975
- Whoa!
- Wahoo!

1342
01:02:05,017 --> 01:02:07,060
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1343
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:10,522
Whoo!

1344
01:02:10,522 --> 01:02:13,150
That was... fun!

1345
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:15,444
I actually enjoyed that.

1346
01:02:15,486 --> 01:02:17,112
Hey, look, turtles!

1347
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:20,073
CRUSH: Ha ha!
Most excellent!

1348
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:21,867
Now turn your
fishy tails around...

1349
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:25,120
and swim straight on
through to Sydney!

1350
01:02:25,162 --> 01:02:27,331
No worries, man!

1351
01:02:27,372 --> 01:02:29,416
No worries!
Thank you, dude Crush!

1352
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:32,002
- Bye!
- Bye, Jellyman!

1353
01:02:32,044 --> 01:02:34,379
You tell your little dude
I said hi, OK?

1354
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:35,547
SQUIRT:
See ya later, dudes!

1355
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:37,341
DORY: Bye, everyone!

1356
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:39,718
Nemo would have loved this.

1357
01:02:39,718 --> 01:02:43,055
Ooh! Hey! Crush, I forgot!

1358
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:44,681
How old are you?

1359
01:02:44,723 --> 01:02:48,894
CRUSH: 150, dude!
And still young! Rock on!

1360
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:52,981
150! 150!
I gotta remember that.

1361
01:02:53,023 --> 01:02:54,233
Whoa.

1362
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:01,657
- We going in there?
- Yep.

1363
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:03,742
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1364
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:09,414
Yep. We're gonna
just swim straight.

1365
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:12,251
* Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming *

1366
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:13,418
Dory...

1367
01:03:22,219 --> 01:03:24,847
MARLIN:
Boy, this is taking awhile.

1368
01:03:24,888 --> 01:03:26,598
DORY:
How about we play a game?

1369
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:27,891
MARLIN: OK.

1370
01:03:27,933 --> 01:03:30,978
DORY: OK, I'm thinking
of something orange...

1371
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:32,521
and it's small...

1372
01:03:32,563 --> 01:03:34,857
- It's me.
- Right!

1373
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:38,443
It's orange and small...

1374
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:39,778
It's me.

1375
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,738
All righty,
Mr. Smartypants.

1376
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:42,614
And it's orange and small
and white stripes...

1377
01:03:42,614 --> 01:03:44,950
And it's orange and small
and white stripes...

1378
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:47,202
Me. And the next one,
just a guess, me.

1379
01:03:47,244 --> 01:03:49,746
- That's just scary.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1380
01:03:49,788 --> 01:03:51,623
I have definitely seen
this floating speck before.

1381
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:53,208
That means
we've passed it before...

1382
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:54,626
and that means
we're going in circles...

1383
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:56,211
and that means
we're not going straight!

1384
01:03:56,295 --> 01:03:58,422
- Hey, hey!
- Get to the surface.

1385
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:00,048
We'll figure it out
up there. Let's go!

1386
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:02,301
- Hey! Relax.
- What?

1387
01:04:02,301 --> 01:04:04,928
Take a deep breath.

1388
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:07,347
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1389
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:09,141
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1390
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:11,226
Fine. Who do you
want to ask, the speck?

1391
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:13,645
- There's nobody here!
- There has to be someone.

1392
01:04:13,645 --> 01:04:16,523
It's the ocean, silly.
We're not the only two in here.

1393
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:18,901
Let's see.
OK, no one there.

1394
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:23,405
Nope. Nada.

1395
01:04:24,823 --> 01:04:26,617
There's somebody.
Hey! Excuse...

1396
01:04:26,658 --> 01:04:28,494
Dory, Dory, Dory!
Now it's my turn.

1397
01:04:28,494 --> 01:04:30,120
I'm thinking of something
dark and mysterious.

1398
01:04:30,162 --> 01:04:32,498
It's a fish we don't know.
If we ask it directions...

1399
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:34,583
it could ingest us
and spit out our bones!

1400
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:37,085
What is it with men
and asking for directions?

1401
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:38,921
I don't want to play
the gender card right now.

1402
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:40,881
Let's play
the "Let's Not Die" card.

1403
01:04:40,923 --> 01:04:42,841
- You want to get out of here?
- Of course I do.

1404
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:46,136
How are we gonna do that
unless we give it a shot?

1405
01:04:46,178 --> 01:04:48,138
Dory, you don't
fully understand...

1406
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,182
Come on. Trust me on this.

1407
01:04:58,273 --> 01:05:02,110
All right.

1408
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:05,364
Excuse me! Whoo-hoo!
Little fella?

1409
01:05:05,405 --> 01:05:08,242
Hello!
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1410
01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:09,326
Hello!
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1411
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:11,411
Ha. Hello.

1412
01:05:11,453 --> 01:05:12,996
- His son Bingo...
- Nemo.

1413
01:05:13,038 --> 01:05:16,041
- Nemo was taken to...
- Sydney.

1414
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:19,294
Sydney! And it's
really, really important...

1415
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:21,255
that we get there
as fast as we can...

1416
01:05:21,296 --> 01:05:23,382
so can you help us out?

1417
01:05:23,423 --> 01:05:26,969
Come on, little fella.
Come on.

1418
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:30,222
Dory, I'm a little fella.

1419
01:05:30,264 --> 01:05:33,767
I don't think
that's a little fella.

1420
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:37,688
DORY: Oh! Big fella.
Whale. OK.

1421
01:05:37,729 --> 01:05:40,190
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1422
01:05:40,232 --> 01:05:43,443
Mooo! Weee neeed...

1423
01:05:43,485 --> 01:05:47,573
- Dory?
- Tooo fiind his son.

1424
01:05:47,614 --> 01:05:50,284
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?

1425
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:51,577
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

1426
01:05:51,577 --> 01:05:53,704
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

1427
01:05:53,745 --> 01:05:56,081
Dory! Heaven knows
what you're saying!

1428
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:59,710
- See, he's swimming away.
- Cooome baaack.

1429
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:02,045
He's not coming back.
You offended him.

1430
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:03,255
- Maybe a different dialect.

1431
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:06,508
- Moooohhhmmooo...
- Dory!

1432
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:09,803
This is not whale.
You're speaking upset stomach.

1433
01:06:09,845 --> 01:06:10,137
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- Don't.

1434
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:12,055
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- Don't.

1435
01:06:12,097 --> 01:06:13,557
Wooooooo...

1436
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:16,560
- You actually sound sick.
- Maybe louder?

1437
01:06:16,602 --> 01:06:18,061
- Rah! Rah!
- Don't do that!

1438
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:19,813
Too much orca.
Didn't it sound orca-ish?

1439
01:06:19,855 --> 01:06:21,190
It doesn't sound orca.

1440
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:23,025
It sounds like nothing
I've ever heard.

1441
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:25,569
- Oooooo!
- Ohh!

1442
01:06:25,611 --> 01:06:26,153
It's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1443
01:06:26,153 --> 01:06:27,529
It's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1444
01:06:27,571 --> 01:06:30,574
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.

1445
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:34,119
- KRILL: Swim away!
- Oh, look, krill!

1446
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:38,499
Move, Dory, move!

1447
01:06:38,499 --> 01:06:39,082
Move, Dory, move!

1448
01:06:39,124 --> 01:06:41,168
- Aah!
- Aah!

1449
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:47,883
Look at that.
Would you look at that?

1450
01:06:47,925 --> 01:06:51,887
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1451
01:06:51,929 --> 01:06:54,932
All thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.

1452
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:56,975
Jacques,
I said no cleaning.

1453
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,852
I am ashamed.

1454
01:06:58,894 --> 01:07:01,355
Look! Scum angel!

1455
01:07:03,607 --> 01:07:05,526
Ooh! Aaah!

1456
01:07:05,567 --> 01:07:07,486
Bubbles!
I love the bubbles!

1457
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:13,200
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo?

1458
01:07:13,242 --> 01:07:15,869
9:00 and cue dentist.

1459
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:18,163
Hello, Barbara.
Sorry I'm late.

1460
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:20,916
OK, here we go.
Here we go, OK.

1461
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:22,668
Little Davey Reynolds...

1462
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:24,294
PEACH: Walks to the counter,
drops the keys...

1463
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:26,463
Bloat, that's disgusting!

1464
01:07:26,505 --> 01:07:28,507
Tastes pretty good to me.

1465
01:07:28,549 --> 01:07:30,342
- Urrrp!
- Eww!

1466
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:33,220
Don't you people realize
we are swimming in our own...

1467
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:34,346
Shh! Here he comes!

1468
01:07:34,388 --> 01:07:36,348
NEMO: Aah!

1469
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:39,685
Crikey. What a state.

1470
01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:45,315
Ohh. Barbara, what's my earliest
appointment tomorrow?

1471
01:07:45,357 --> 01:07:48,277
- 10:00, luv.
- Leave it open, would you?

1472
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:50,654
I've gotta clean the fish tank
before Darla gets here.

1473
01:07:50,696 --> 01:07:52,781
Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

1474
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:56,493
NEMO: Yay!
He's gonna clean the tank!

1475
01:07:56,535 --> 01:07:58,328
We're gonna be clean!

1476
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,997
You ready to see your dad, kid?

1477
01:08:00,038 --> 01:08:01,999
- Uh-huh.
- Of course you are.

1478
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,668
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's out there...

1479
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:05,252
in the harbor
waiting for you right now.

1480
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:07,921
In the harbor
waiting for you right now.

1481
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:10,340
Yeah.

1482
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,529
Aaah!

1483
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:16,406
Oof!

1484
01:09:21,578 --> 01:09:23,038
Whoo!

1485
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,290
Yaahhh!

1486
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:27,084
DORY: Here comes the big one.

1487
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:29,628
Ooh! Come on!
You gotta try this!

1488
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:32,923
- Will you just stop it?
- Why? What's wrong?

1489
01:09:32,965 --> 01:09:35,259
We're in a whale,
don't you get it?

1490
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,468
- Whale?
- A whale!

1491
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:39,263
You had to ask for help!
And now we're stuck here!

1492
01:09:39,263 --> 01:09:42,057
Wow, a whale.
I speak whale.

1493
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:44,434
No, you're insane!
You can't speak whale!

1494
01:09:44,434 --> 01:09:47,646
I have to get out!
I have to find my son!

1495
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:53,110
I have to tell him
how old sea turtles are!

1496
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:58,282
Ohhh!

1497
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:02,327
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1498
01:10:04,121 --> 01:10:06,957
Hey...

1499
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:09,251
you OK?

1500
01:10:15,299 --> 01:10:18,302
There, there.
It's all right.

1501
01:10:18,343 --> 01:10:20,304
It'll be OK.

1502
01:10:20,304 --> 01:10:22,556
No. No, it won't.

1503
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:24,808
Sure it will. You'll see.

1504
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:30,981
No. I promised him I'd never
let anything happen to him.

1505
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:34,443
Huh. That's a funny thing
to promise.

1506
01:10:34,485 --> 01:10:35,819
What?

1507
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:38,322
You can't never let
anything happen to him.

1508
01:10:38,322 --> 01:10:40,782
Then nothing
would ever happen to him.

1509
01:10:43,827 --> 01:10:46,580
Not much fun for little Harpo.

1510
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:57,257
- Hmm.
- What's going on?

1511
01:10:57,299 --> 01:10:59,593
Don't know. I'll ask him.

1512
01:11:02,137 --> 01:11:08,143
- Dory...
- Whaaat's goooing onnn?

1513
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:15,818
I think he says we've stopped.

1514
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:19,112
Of course we've stopped.
Stop trying to speak whale.

1515
01:11:19,154 --> 01:11:21,949
You'll make things worse.
What is that noise?

1516
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:28,872
Oh, no. Look what you did.

1517
01:11:28,872 --> 01:11:33,836
The water's going down.
It's going down!

1518
01:11:37,548 --> 01:11:39,007
Really? You sure about that?

1519
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:41,093
Look!
Already it's half empty!

1520
01:11:41,134 --> 01:11:42,886
I'd say it's half full.

1521
01:11:42,928 --> 01:11:44,388
Stop that! It's half empty!

1522
01:11:47,474 --> 01:11:50,686
OK, that one
was a little tougher.

1523
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:53,272
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

1524
01:11:53,272 --> 01:11:53,605
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

1525
01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:55,816
or he wants a root beer float.

1526
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:57,484
Of course he wants us
to go there!

1527
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:59,444
That's eating us!

1528
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:02,447
How do I taste, Moby?
Do I taste good?

1529
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:04,741
Tell him I'm not interested
in being lunch!

1530
01:12:04,783 --> 01:12:07,244
- OK. Heee...
- Stop talking to him!

1531
01:12:10,581 --> 01:12:13,417
- Aah!
- Aah!

1532
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:14,585
What is going on?

1533
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:16,920
I'll check. Whaaat...

1534
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:19,756
No more whale!
You can't speak whale!

1535
01:12:19,756 --> 01:12:22,092
- Yes, I can!
- No, you can't!

1536
01:12:22,134 --> 01:12:25,721
You think you can do these
things, but you can't, Nemo!

1537
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:33,562
- OK.
- Dory! Oof!

1538
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:39,735
He says it's time to let go.

1539
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:41,737
Everything's gonna be
all right.

1540
01:12:41,778 --> 01:12:43,447
How do you know?

1541
01:12:43,447 --> 01:12:46,575
How do you know something bad
isn't gonna happen?

1542
01:12:46,617 --> 01:12:48,494
I don't!

1543
01:13:00,714 --> 01:13:04,009
- Aah!
- Aah!

1544
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:04,927
- Aah!
- Aah!

1545
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:06,720
- Aah!
- Aah!

1546
01:13:09,139 --> 01:13:13,894
Ha ha ha!
We're alive!

1547
01:13:14,978 --> 01:13:17,815
Look! Sy-d-ney... Sydney!

1548
01:13:17,856 --> 01:13:20,317
Sydney! Sydney again!

1549
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:24,780
You were right, Dory!
We made it!

1550
01:13:24,822 --> 01:13:27,741
We're gonna find my son!

1551
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:30,744
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!

1552
01:13:30,744 --> 01:13:33,789
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!

1553
01:13:33,831 --> 01:13:36,333
Wow. I wish
I could speak whale.

1554
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:38,669
All we gotta do is find
the boat that took him.

1555
01:13:38,669 --> 01:13:41,797
- Right!
- We can do this!

1556
01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:57,688
Morning.

1557
01:13:57,729 --> 01:14:01,024
It's morning, everyone!
Today's the day!

1558
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:03,193
The sun is shining,
the tank is clean...

1559
01:14:03,235 --> 01:14:06,321
and we are getting out...
The tank is clean.

1560
01:14:06,363 --> 01:14:08,907
The tank is clean!

1561
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:10,534
DEB: But how?

1562
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:13,287
Boss must've installed it
while we were sleeping.

1563
01:14:13,328 --> 01:14:16,790
- What are we gonna do?
- What's it say, Peach?

1564
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:19,501
I can't hear you, Peach.

1565
01:14:19,543 --> 01:14:21,962
The Aquascum 2003 is
an all-purpose, self-cleaning...

1566
01:14:22,004 --> 01:14:23,964
maintenance-free,
salt water purifier...

1567
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:27,009
that is guaranteed to extend
the life of your aquarium fish.

1568
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:28,260
Stop it!

1569
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:29,803
The Aquascum
is programmed to scan...

1570
01:14:29,845 --> 01:14:32,139
your tank environment
every five minutes?!

1571
01:14:32,181 --> 01:14:33,891
Scan? What does that mean?

1572
01:14:35,517 --> 01:14:37,352
Aah!

1573
01:14:38,729 --> 01:14:39,146
AQUASCUM:
Temperature... 82 degrees...

1574
01:14:39,146 --> 01:14:40,314
AQUASCUM:
Temperature... 82 degrees...

1575
01:14:40,355 --> 01:14:42,024
PH balance... normal.

1576
01:14:42,065 --> 01:14:44,443
- Ooh.
- Nice.

1577
01:14:44,485 --> 01:14:49,031
Ooh... Oh!
Curse you, Aquascum!

1578
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:51,200
That's it for the escape plan.
It's ruined.

1579
01:14:51,241 --> 01:14:52,659
Then what are
we gonna do about...

1580
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:53,160
ALL: Darla!

1581
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,703
ALL: Darla!

1582
01:14:54,745 --> 01:14:57,331
Stay down, kid!

1583
01:14:57,372 --> 01:14:59,333
- False alarm.
- Whew.

1584
01:14:59,374 --> 01:15:01,460
My nerves can't take
much more of this.

1585
01:15:01,502 --> 01:15:03,754
BLOAT: What'll we do
when that brat gets here?

1586
01:15:03,754 --> 01:15:06,006
- I'm thinking.
- Oh! Gill!

1587
01:15:06,048 --> 01:15:09,218
- Nemo! I'm coming!
- Help me! Help me!

1588
01:15:09,259 --> 01:15:13,138
Swim down! Come on, kid!

1589
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,681
- Everybody jump in!
- Swim down!

1590
01:15:14,723 --> 01:15:16,016
- That's it!
- What the...?

1591
01:15:16,058 --> 01:15:19,311
- Yay!
- Ha ha! Good work!

1592
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:20,896
Gill!

1593
01:15:20,938 --> 01:15:22,523
- Nemo!
- Sharkbait!

1594
01:15:22,564 --> 01:15:25,943
- Roll, kid!
- Lean! Lean!

1595
01:15:30,447 --> 01:15:32,866
DENTIST: Whoops.
That would've been a nasty fall.

1596
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:35,494
Gill!
Don't let me go belly-up!

1597
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:37,830
Just calm down, Nemo.
You won't go belly-up.

1598
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:40,290
I promise.
You're gonna be OK.

1599
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:45,254
ALL: Darla!

1600
01:15:48,757 --> 01:15:52,469
Do any of these boats
look familiar to you?

1601
01:15:52,511 --> 01:15:54,429
No, but the boat
has to be here somewhere.

1602
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:56,598
Come on, Dory.
We're gonna find it.

1603
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,351
I'm totally excited.
Are you excited?

1604
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:01,145
Dory, wake up.
Wake up, come on.

1605
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:03,021
Duck!

1606
01:16:03,063 --> 01:16:06,483
That's not a duck.
It's a... pelican!

1607
01:16:06,483 --> 01:16:07,943
- Whoa!
- Aah!

1608
01:16:14,616 --> 01:16:15,784
- Whoa!
- Aah!

1609
01:16:15,826 --> 01:16:19,079
No! I didn't come this far
to be breakfast!

1610
01:16:26,587 --> 01:16:29,047
Hey, Nigel.
Would you look at that?

1611
01:16:29,089 --> 01:16:30,465
What? What?

1612
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:33,343
Sun's barely up and Gerald's
had more than he can handle.

1613
01:16:33,385 --> 01:16:36,013
Yeah. Reckon somebody
ought to help the poor guy.

1614
01:16:36,054 --> 01:16:38,056
ALL: Yeah, right. Yeah.

1615
01:16:38,098 --> 01:16:41,727
Don't everybody
fly off at once.

1616
01:16:44,855 --> 01:16:47,774
All right, Gerald.
Fish got your tongue?

1617
01:16:47,816 --> 01:16:50,402
- Aah!
- Love a duck!

1618
01:16:50,402 --> 01:16:50,777
- Aah!
- Love a duck!

1619
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:52,529
I gotta find my son Nemo!

1620
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:55,657
Nemo? He's that fish!

1621
01:16:55,699 --> 01:16:58,243
The one that's been fighting
the whole ocean!

1622
01:16:58,285 --> 01:17:00,746
I know where your son... Huh?

1623
01:17:02,372 --> 01:17:04,082
Wait! Come back! Stop!

1624
01:17:04,124 --> 01:17:06,376
Dory, keep going!
He's crazy!

1625
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:08,170
I got something to tell you!

1626
01:17:12,508 --> 01:17:14,009
Mine.

1627
01:17:18,055 --> 01:17:21,600
Don't make any sudden moves.

1628
01:17:21,642 --> 01:17:25,896
Hop inside my mouth
if you want to live.

1629
01:17:25,938 --> 01:17:29,566
Hop in your mouth?
How does that make me live?

1630
01:17:29,608 --> 01:17:30,776
GULL: Mine?

1631
01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:31,151
NIGEL: Because
I can take you to your son.

1632
01:17:31,151 --> 01:17:34,446
NIGEL: Because
I can take you to your son.

1633
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:37,157
- Yeah, right.
- No. I know your son.

1634
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,910
He's orange with
a gimpy fin on one side.

1635
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:41,078
- That's Nemo!
- Aah!

1636
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:43,789
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1637
01:17:43,831 --> 01:17:45,290
DORY: Aah!

1638
01:17:45,332 --> 01:17:47,835
Fasten your seat belts!

1639
01:17:48,961 --> 01:17:51,088
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1640
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:53,215
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1641
01:17:53,257 --> 01:17:55,384
DORY: Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

1642
01:17:55,425 --> 01:17:59,012
Ha ha ha ha!

1643
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:02,141
MARLIN: Aah!

1644
01:18:09,523 --> 01:18:11,733
Everybody hold on!

1645
01:18:11,775 --> 01:18:13,527
- Aah!
- Aah!

1646
01:18:15,112 --> 01:18:17,573
Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1647
01:18:23,704 --> 01:18:26,331
BUBBLES: Too loud!
Too loud for me!

1648
01:18:26,373 --> 01:18:28,625
* Twinkle, twinkle,
little star *

1649
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:31,503
Find a happy place!
Find a happy place!

1650
01:18:31,545 --> 01:18:34,089
Darla, your uncle
will see you now.

1651
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:38,635
All right, let's see
those pearly whites.

1652
01:18:38,677 --> 01:18:42,973
Raah! I'm a piranha.
They're in the Amazon.

1653
01:18:43,015 --> 01:18:46,477
And a piranha's a fish,
just like your present.

1654
01:18:47,811 --> 01:18:49,605
DARLA:
* I get fishy, fishy *

1655
01:18:49,646 --> 01:18:52,733
Oh, no.
Poor little guy.

1656
01:18:52,774 --> 01:18:54,610
- He's dead.
- Sharkbait!

1657
01:18:54,651 --> 01:18:55,819
Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!

1658
01:18:55,861 --> 01:18:57,446
Must've left your present
in the car, sweetie.

1659
01:18:57,488 --> 01:18:59,823
- Ohh!
- I'll go and get it.

1660
01:18:59,823 --> 01:19:01,575
- He's still alive!
- He's not dead!

1661
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:03,619
What's happening?
Why is he playing dead?

1662
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,537
GILL: He's gonna get flushed
down the toilet.

1663
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:07,998
- He's gonna get out of here!
- He's gonna get flushed!

1664
01:19:07,998 --> 01:19:09,791
GURGLE:
What a smart little guy!

1665
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,376
GILL: Oh, no!
Not the trash can!

1666
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:12,711
Nemo! No!

1667
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:16,173
- Hey! I found his dad!
- Where's Nemo?

1668
01:19:16,173 --> 01:19:17,549
- Dentist!
- He's over there!

1669
01:19:17,591 --> 01:19:21,011
What's a dentist?
Nigel, get in there!

1670
01:19:21,011 --> 01:19:24,973
- I can't go in there!
- Yes, you can! Charge!

1671
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:27,976
- Aah!
- What the...?

1672
01:19:29,269 --> 01:19:31,855
Darla, sweetie, look out!

1673
01:19:35,275 --> 01:19:37,444
- Aah!
- Hold still!

1674
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:39,404
- Aah!
- Easy! Easy!

1675
01:19:40,697 --> 01:19:41,949
- Aah!
- Hold still!

1676
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:45,160
Nobody's going to hurt you!
Oof!

1677
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:53,627
Nemo.

1678
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:54,920
Oh, my goodness.

1679
01:19:54,962 --> 01:19:56,880
Gotcha! Keep down!

1680
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,173
MARLIN: Nemo!

1681
01:19:58,215 --> 01:19:59,925
Daddy?

1682
01:19:59,967 --> 01:20:03,804
Out with you!
And stay out!

1683
01:20:03,846 --> 01:20:05,180
Daddy?

1684
01:20:05,222 --> 01:20:06,598
Fishy?

1685
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:09,768
Fishy! Wake up!

1686
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:10,978
DEB: Oh, no!

1687
01:20:11,019 --> 01:20:13,522
GILL: To the top of
Mount Wannahockaloogie!

1688
01:20:13,564 --> 01:20:15,983
Why are you sleeping?

1689
01:20:16,024 --> 01:20:18,443
- Hurry!
- Bloat!

1690
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:23,615
Ring of Fire!

1691
01:20:24,616 --> 01:20:28,203
Fishy! Aah!

1692
01:20:29,663 --> 01:20:31,707
Crikey! All the animals
have gone mad!

1693
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:33,500
Unh!

1694
01:20:33,542 --> 01:20:36,086
DARLA: Aaah! Get it out!

1695
01:20:36,128 --> 01:20:38,714
- Smack her in the head!
- Go, Gill, go!

1696
01:20:38,755 --> 01:20:40,716
Fish in my hair!

1697
01:20:40,757 --> 01:20:42,134
Gill!

1698
01:20:42,176 --> 01:20:46,680
Sharkbait...
tell your dad I said hi.

1699
01:20:46,722 --> 01:20:48,223
- Unh!
- Eww!

1700
01:20:51,727 --> 01:20:52,978
Go get 'em!

1701
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:55,397
DENTIST: Ohh...

1702
01:20:57,983 --> 01:20:59,735
- He did it!
- Yay!

1703
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:02,696
- I'm so happy!
- Is he gonna be OK, Gill?

1704
01:21:02,738 --> 01:21:04,948
Don't worry.
All drains lead to the ocean.

1705
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,742
Fishy!

1706
01:21:08,327 --> 01:21:11,622
Aah!

1707
01:21:11,622 --> 01:21:14,249
Aah! Whoa! Whoa!

1708
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:16,627
Daddy!

1709
01:21:52,412 --> 01:21:55,249
I'm so sorry.

1710
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:57,876
Truly, I am.

1711
01:21:57,876 --> 01:21:58,710
Truly, I am.

1712
01:22:16,061 --> 01:22:18,272
- Hey.
- Dory...

1713
01:22:18,313 --> 01:22:20,357
if it wasn't for you...

1714
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:23,193
I never would've even
made it here.

1715
01:22:23,235 --> 01:22:25,237
So, thank you.

1716
01:22:27,364 --> 01:22:29,074
Hey, wait a minute.

1717
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:31,660
Wait. Where are you going?

1718
01:22:31,702 --> 01:22:35,289
It's over, Dory.
We were too late.

1719
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:40,085
Nemo's gone,
and I'm going home now.

1720
01:22:40,127 --> 01:22:42,629
No. No, you can't.

1721
01:22:44,464 --> 01:22:46,216
Stop!

1722
01:22:47,843 --> 01:22:49,595
Please don't go away.

1723
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:51,555
Please?

1724
01:22:51,597 --> 01:22:54,391
No one's ever stuck with me
for so long before.

1725
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:57,978
And if you leave, I just...

1726
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,938
I remember things
better with you.

1727
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:02,983
I do. Look...
P. Sherman, 42...

1728
01:23:03,025 --> 01:23:05,944
42...

1729
01:23:05,986 --> 01:23:08,739
I remember it.
I do. It's there.

1730
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:10,866
I know it is because
when I look at you...

1731
01:23:10,908 --> 01:23:12,367
I can feel it.

1732
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:18,207
I look at you
and I... l'm home.

1733
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:21,627
Please...

1734
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:24,296
I don't want that to go away.

1735
01:23:24,338 --> 01:23:26,715
I don't want to forget.

1736
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:32,095
I'm sorry, Dory, but I do.

1737
01:23:43,398 --> 01:23:46,652
- Manna from heaven.
- Sweet nectar of life!

1738
01:23:46,693 --> 01:23:48,737
BOTH: Hey! Hey! Hey!

1739
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:52,199
- This is our spot!
- Get outta here!

1740
01:23:53,534 --> 01:23:55,619
BOTH: Hey! Hey! Hey!

1741
01:23:55,744 --> 01:23:57,204
Yeah, that's it, fella.

1742
01:23:57,246 --> 01:23:58,872
Just keep on swimmin'.
You got that.

1743
01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:00,916
Too right, mate!

1744
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:02,292
Oh! I got a live one here!

1745
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:03,752
Have you seen my dad?

1746
01:24:03,794 --> 01:24:06,004
Gotcha! Hey! Hey!
Come back here!

1747
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:07,548
You let him go!

1748
01:24:07,589 --> 01:24:09,716
BOTH: Hey! Hey!

1749
01:24:09,716 --> 01:24:14,221
Dad! Dad!

1750
01:24:14,263 --> 01:24:15,889
Dad!

1751
01:24:26,817 --> 01:24:29,236
Ohh!

1752
01:24:29,278 --> 01:24:32,322
NEMO: Um, excuse me.

1753
01:24:32,364 --> 01:24:33,615
Are you all right?

1754
01:24:33,657 --> 01:24:36,285
I don't know where I am.
I don't know what's going on.

1755
01:24:36,326 --> 01:24:39,163
I think I lost somebody,
but I can't remember.

1756
01:24:39,204 --> 01:24:43,292
NEMO: It's OK.
I'm looking for someone, too.

1757
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:45,794
Hey, we can look together.

1758
01:24:45,836 --> 01:24:48,172
I'm Dory.

1759
01:24:48,172 --> 01:24:49,339
I'm Nemo.

1760
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:52,759
Nemo? That's a nice name.

1761
01:25:01,685 --> 01:25:04,646
- Dad!
- Dad!

1762
01:25:04,688 --> 01:25:06,732
Wait a minute.
Is it your dad or my dad?

1763
01:25:06,773 --> 01:25:09,234
- My dad.
- Got it. Dad!

1764
01:25:09,276 --> 01:25:11,528
- Where are we, anyway?
- Dad! Dad!

1765
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:15,491
Oh. Syl... Shi... Sydney.

1766
01:25:15,532 --> 01:25:19,786
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

1767
01:25:19,828 --> 01:25:21,580
Aah! Nemo!

1768
01:25:21,622 --> 01:25:23,999
It's you! Aah!
You're Nemo!

1769
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:25,667
Yes, yes, I'm Nemo!

1770
01:25:25,709 --> 01:25:28,337
You're Nemo!
You were dead. I saw you.

1771
01:25:28,378 --> 01:25:30,255
And here you are!
I found you.

1772
01:25:30,297 --> 01:25:33,050
You're not dead.
And your father... Your father!

1773
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:35,427
You know my father?!
Where is he?

1774
01:25:35,469 --> 01:25:38,305
This way!
He went this way. Quick!

1775
01:25:38,347 --> 01:25:39,973
DORY: Hey, hey, hey!

1776
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:41,183
BOTH: Hey! Hey!

1777
01:25:41,225 --> 01:25:42,684
Have you seen
an orange fish swim by?

1778
01:25:42,726 --> 01:25:45,103
- It looks just like him!
- But bigger!

1779
01:25:45,145 --> 01:25:46,396
Yeah, I saw him, bluey.

1780
01:25:46,396 --> 01:25:47,898
But I'm not tellin' you
where he went...

1781
01:25:47,898 --> 01:25:53,445
and there's no way
you're gonna make me.

1782
01:25:53,445 --> 01:25:54,613
GULL: Mine.

1783
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:57,491
CRAB: Aah!
All right! I'll talk!

1784
01:25:57,533 --> 01:26:04,248
He went to
the fishing grounds! Aah!

1785
01:26:04,248 --> 01:26:06,083
Hey, look out!

1786
01:26:06,124 --> 01:26:08,627
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to get home.

1787
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:13,423
NEMO, DISTANTLY: Dad! Dad!

1788
01:26:13,423 --> 01:26:14,842
Nemo?

1789
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:17,344
- Daddy!
- Nemo?

1790
01:26:17,386 --> 01:26:19,138
- Dad!
- Nemo's alive!

1791
01:26:19,138 --> 01:26:19,388
- Dad!
- Nemo's alive!

1792
01:26:19,429 --> 01:26:21,390
Dory? Nemo!

1793
01:26:21,431 --> 01:26:22,641
Daddy!

1794
01:26:22,683 --> 01:26:24,977
Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo!

1795
01:26:25,018 --> 01:26:28,689
- Dad!
- Nemo! Thank goodness.

1796
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:31,650
It's all right, son.
It's gonna be OK.

1797
01:26:31,692 --> 01:26:34,570
GROUPER: Turn around!
You're going the wrong way!

1798
01:26:37,072 --> 01:26:38,448
DORY: Aah! Look out!

1799
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:41,076
MARLIN: Oh, my...

1800
01:26:57,801 --> 01:27:01,388
DORY: Help! He-e-elp!

1801
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:03,015
- Dory!
- Come on!

1802
01:27:03,056 --> 01:27:04,475
DORY: Help! Help!

1803
01:27:04,475 --> 01:27:07,227
Help! Get us out! Aah!

1804
01:27:07,269 --> 01:27:09,062
No, no, no! Dory!

1805
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:12,107
- Dad, I know what to do!
- Nemo! No!

1806
01:27:12,149 --> 01:27:14,860
We have to tell all the fish
to swim down together!

1807
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:17,613
- Get out of there now!
- I know this will work!

1808
01:27:17,654 --> 01:27:19,573
No, I am not
gonna lose you again!

1809
01:27:19,615 --> 01:27:23,035
There's no time!
It's the only way to save Dory!

1810
01:27:24,328 --> 01:27:25,829
I can do this.

1811
01:27:26,997 --> 01:27:29,124
You're right.

1812
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:31,001
I know you can.

1813
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:33,921
- Lucky fin!
- Now, go! Hurry!

1814
01:27:33,962 --> 01:27:36,757
Tell all the fish to swim down!

1815
01:27:36,799 --> 01:27:40,177
Well? You heard my son!
Come on!

1816
01:27:41,678 --> 01:27:44,306
Dory, you have
to tell everybody to...

1817
01:27:44,348 --> 01:27:45,849
Swim down together!

1818
01:27:45,891 --> 01:27:48,185
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

1819
01:27:48,185 --> 01:27:50,479
Swim down!

1820
01:27:54,817 --> 01:27:56,026
Everybody swim down!

1821
01:27:56,068 --> 01:27:58,612
Come on,
you have to swim down!

1822
01:27:58,654 --> 01:28:01,365
Down! Swim down!

1823
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:07,079
MARLIN:
Swim down! Swim down!

1824
01:28:14,795 --> 01:28:17,214
Don't give up!
Keep swimming!

1825
01:28:17,214 --> 01:28:19,675
Just keep swimming!

1826
01:28:23,887 --> 01:28:25,514
MARLIN: That's it!

1827
01:28:28,475 --> 01:28:30,477
It's working!

1828
01:28:32,896 --> 01:28:35,941
ALL: Keep swimming!
Keep swimming!

1829
01:28:35,983 --> 01:28:38,110
MARLIN: Just keep swimming!
Keep swimming!

1830
01:28:38,152 --> 01:28:39,611
Come on, Dad!

1831
01:28:39,653 --> 01:28:42,156
- You're doing great, son!
- That's my dad.

1832
01:28:42,197 --> 01:28:44,491
Let's get to the bottom!
Keep swimming!

1833
01:28:44,533 --> 01:28:47,035
* Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming *

1834
01:28:47,077 --> 01:28:49,288
Almost there!
Keep swimming!

1835
01:28:52,875 --> 01:28:54,209
ALL: Keep swimming!

1836
01:28:56,503 --> 01:28:57,629
Keep swimming!

1837
01:29:08,056 --> 01:29:09,516
- Oof!
- Hey!

1838
01:29:09,558 --> 01:29:13,145
- Dory! Where's Nemo?
- There!

1839
01:29:14,855 --> 01:29:17,900
Oh, no. Nemo!

1840
01:29:23,864 --> 01:29:25,782
Nemo?

1841
01:29:27,451 --> 01:29:29,745
Nemo?

1842
01:29:29,786 --> 01:29:33,749
It's OK. Daddy's here.
Daddy's got you.

1843
01:29:38,212 --> 01:29:39,379
Daddy?

1844
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:40,923
Oh, thank goodness.

1845
01:29:40,964 --> 01:29:44,676
Dad... I don't hate you.

1846
01:29:44,718 --> 01:29:46,553
Oh, no, no, no.

1847
01:29:46,595 --> 01:29:49,264
I'm so sorry, Nemo.

1848
01:29:58,482 --> 01:30:01,360
- Hey, guess what?
- What?

1849
01:30:01,401 --> 01:30:04,905
Sea turtles... I met one.

1850
01:30:04,947 --> 01:30:09,159
And he was 150 years old.

1851
01:30:09,159 --> 01:30:13,330
- 150?
- Yep.

1852
01:30:13,372 --> 01:30:18,210
Sandy Plankton said
they only live to be 100.

1853
01:30:18,252 --> 01:30:19,795
Sandy Plankton?

1854
01:30:19,837 --> 01:30:21,839
Do you think I would
cross the entire ocean...

1855
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,966
and not know as much
as Sandy Plankton?

1856
01:30:24,007 --> 01:30:26,677
- Ha ha ha!
- He was 150! Not 100!

1857
01:30:26,718 --> 01:30:30,597
Who is this Sandy Plankton
who knows everything?

1858
01:30:32,307 --> 01:30:32,891
Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

1859
01:30:32,891 --> 01:30:35,894
Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

1860
01:30:35,936 --> 01:30:39,022
- I'm gonna win!
- No, you're not!

1861
01:30:39,064 --> 01:30:42,860
- I did it!
- Aw, my own son beats me!

1862
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:45,362
Climb aboard, explorers.

1863
01:30:45,362 --> 01:30:48,490
The sea cucumber looks over
to the mollusk and says...

1864
01:30:48,532 --> 01:30:51,410
"With fronds like these,
who needs anemones?"

1865
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,372
Hello, Nemo. Who's this?

1866
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:58,917
- Exchange student.
- I'm from the E.A.C., dude!

1867
01:30:58,959 --> 01:31:01,587
- Sweet!
- Totally.

1868
01:31:01,628 --> 01:31:03,589
Seriously, Marty.

1869
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:05,591
Did you really do all
the things you say you did?

1870
01:31:05,632 --> 01:31:07,342
BRUCE: Pardon me.

1871
01:31:07,384 --> 01:31:10,053
- Hello.
- Ohh.

1872
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:11,763
Don't be alarmed.

1873
01:31:11,805 --> 01:31:15,559
We wanted to make sure our
newest member got home safely.

1874
01:31:15,601 --> 01:31:17,936
- Thanks, guys.
- See you next week.

1875
01:31:17,978 --> 01:31:21,440
- Keep up with the program.
- Remember, fish are friends...

1876
01:31:21,482 --> 01:31:23,859
Not food! Bye!

1877
01:31:23,901 --> 01:31:25,736
MR. RAY:
Hold on, here we go!

1878
01:31:25,777 --> 01:31:27,488
Next stop... knowledge!

1879
01:31:27,529 --> 01:31:29,990
Bye, son! Have fun!

1880
01:31:30,032 --> 01:31:31,325
NEMO: Bye, Dad!

1881
01:31:31,366 --> 01:31:34,786
Oh! Mr. Ray, wait.
I forgot something.

1882
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:42,085
Love you, Dad.

1883
01:31:42,127 --> 01:31:44,129
I love you, too, son.

1884
01:31:46,423 --> 01:31:49,802
Dad? You can let go now.

1885
01:31:49,843 --> 01:31:53,597
Sorry. Go have an adventure.

1886
01:31:53,597 --> 01:31:55,849
Good-bye!
See ya later, dudes!

1887
01:31:55,933 --> 01:31:58,393
- Bye, Elmo!
- Nemo.

1888
01:31:58,435 --> 01:32:01,897
- Bye, Nemo!
- See you after school, Dory!

1889
01:32:01,939 --> 01:32:02,314
Bye, Dad!

1890
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:04,775
Bye, Dad!

1891
01:32:04,817 --> 01:32:06,902
Bye, son.

1892
01:32:23,961 --> 01:32:26,922
DENTIST: Barbara,
I don't understand it.

1893
01:32:26,964 --> 01:32:29,341
Here this thing has
a lifetime guarantee...

1894
01:32:29,383 --> 01:32:30,592
and it breaks!

1895
01:32:30,634 --> 01:32:32,970
I had to clean the tank myself,
take all the fish out...

1896
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:35,347
put 'em in bags, and...

1897
01:32:35,389 --> 01:32:37,891
Where'd the fish go?

1898
01:32:42,729 --> 01:32:44,481
- Come on, Peach!
- Hurry!

1899
01:32:44,481 --> 01:32:46,316
- You can do it!
- That's it.

1900
01:32:46,358 --> 01:32:47,818
Just a little further.

1901
01:32:47,818 --> 01:32:50,070
PEACH: That's the shortest
red light I've ever seen!

1902
01:32:50,112 --> 01:32:52,322
- Come on, Peach!
- Ohh. Aah!

1903
01:33:01,665 --> 01:33:03,500
BLOAT: Now what?

1904
01:33:10,966 --> 01:33:14,094
* Somewhere *

1905
01:33:14,136 --> 01:33:16,305
* Beyond the sea *

1906
01:33:16,346 --> 01:33:21,477
* Somewhere,
waitin' for me *

1907
01:33:21,518 --> 01:33:26,482
* My lover stands
on golden sands *

1908
01:33:26,482 --> 01:33:28,901
* And watches the ships *

1909
01:33:28,942 --> 01:33:32,946
* That go sailin' *

1910
01:33:32,988 --> 01:33:35,949
* Somewhere *

1911
01:33:35,991 --> 01:33:38,327
* Beyond the sea *

1912
01:33:38,327 --> 01:33:43,457
* She's there
watchin' for me *

1913
01:33:43,499 --> 01:33:48,337
* If I could fly
like birds on high *

1914
01:33:48,337 --> 01:33:51,048
* Then straight
to her arms *

1915
01:33:51,089 --> 01:33:54,760
* I'll go sailin' *

1916
01:33:54,802 --> 01:33:57,846
* It's far *

1917
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:00,557
* Beyond the stars *

1918
01:34:00,599 --> 01:34:04,520
* It's near,
beyond the moon *

1919
01:34:05,521 --> 01:34:08,982
* I know *

1920
01:34:09,024 --> 01:34:11,151
* Beyond a doubt *

1921
01:34:11,193 --> 01:34:13,153
* My heart *

1922
01:34:13,195 --> 01:34:16,698
* Will lead me there soon *

1923
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:19,701
* We'll meet *

1924
01:34:19,743 --> 01:34:22,287
* Beyond the shore *

1925
01:34:22,329 --> 01:34:27,209
* We'll kiss
just like before *

1926
01:34:27,209 --> 01:34:32,047
* Happy we'll be
beyond the sea *

1927
01:34:32,089 --> 01:34:34,424
* And never again *

1928
01:34:34,466 --> 01:34:38,345
* I'll go sailin' *

1929
01:35:10,085 --> 01:35:14,631
* I know *

1930
01:35:14,673 --> 01:35:17,301
* Beyond a doubt *

1931
01:35:17,342 --> 01:35:19,261
* My heart *

1932
01:35:19,261 --> 01:35:22,973
* Will lead me there soon *

1933
01:35:23,015 --> 01:35:25,767
* Oh, we'll meet,
I know we'll meet *

1934
01:35:25,809 --> 01:35:28,228
* Beyond the shore *

1935
01:35:28,270 --> 01:35:33,400
* We'll kiss
just as before *

1936
01:35:33,442 --> 01:35:38,405
* Happy we will be
beyond the sea *

1937
01:35:38,447 --> 01:35:40,574
* And never again *

1938
01:35:40,616 --> 01:35:44,244
* I'll go sailin' *

1939
01:35:46,288 --> 01:35:48,624
* No more sailin' *

1940
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,378
* So long,
sailin', sailin' *

1941
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:55,714
* No more sailin' *

1942
01:35:57,299 --> 01:36:01,303
* Good-bye, farewell,
my friend *

1943
01:36:01,345 --> 01:36:03,138
* No more sailin' *

1944
01:36:05,224 --> 01:36:06,975
* So long *

1945
01:36:07,017 --> 01:36:09,144
* Sailin' *

1946
01:36:09,186 --> 01:36:10,854
* No more sailin' *

1947
01:36:14,191 --> 01:36:15,901
* No more *

1948
01:36:15,943 --> 01:36:17,778
* Farewell *

1949
01:36:19,738 --> 01:36:21,615
* Auf wiedersehen *

1950
01:36:21,657 --> 01:36:24,993
* Adieu to you and you *

1951
01:36:30,666 --> 01:36:32,668
* No more sailin' *

1952
01:36:34,461 --> 01:36:36,004
* No more *

1953
01:36:36,046 --> 01:36:40,843
* Ohh, no more sailin' *

1954
01:36:42,803 --> 01:36:46,682
* No more, no more *

1955
01:36:48,851 --> 01:36:54,982
* No more sailin' *

1956
01:36:59,862 --> 01:37:01,697
* No more *

1957
01:37:03,532 --> 01:37:05,284
* One more time *

1958
01:37:06,702 --> 01:37:14,126
* No more sailin' *

1959
01:37:15,305 --> 01:37:21,793
