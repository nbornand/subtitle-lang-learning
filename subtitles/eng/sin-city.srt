00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,920
<i>She shivers in the wind
like the last leaf on a dying tree.</i>

3
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,360
<i>I let her hear my footsteps.</i>

4
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,400
<i>She only goes stiff for a moment.</i>

5
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,160
Care for a smoke?

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,800
Sure.
I'll take one.

7
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,360
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?

8
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,560
I didn't come here for the party.
I came here for you.

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,960
I've watched you for days.

10
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,600
You're everything a man could ever want.

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,000
It's not just your face,

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,480
your figure, or your voice.

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,320
It's your eyes.

14
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,880
All the things I see in your eyes.

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,320
What is it you see in my eyes?

16
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,280
I see a crazy calm.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,880
You're sick of running.

18
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,960
You're ready to face what you have to face.

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,760
But you don't want to face it alone.

20
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,760
No.

21
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,880
I don't want to face it alone.

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,120
<i>The wind rises electric.</i>

23
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,720
<i>She's soft and warm
and almost weightless.</i>

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,600
<i>Her perfume a sweet promise
that brings tears to my eyes.</i>

25
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,520
<i>I tell her that everything will be all right.</i>

26
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,040
<i>That I'll save her from whatever
she's scared of and take her far, far away.</i>

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,120
<i>I tell her I love her.</i>

28
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,760
<i>The silencer
makes a whisper of the gunshot.</i>

29
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,440
<i>I hold her close until she's gone.</i>

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,800
<i>I'll never know
what she was running from.</i>

31
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,200
<i>I'll cash her check in the morning.</i>

32
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,040
<i>Just one hour to go.
My last day on the job.</i>

33
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,880
<i>Early retirement.
Not my idea.</i>

34
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,760
<i>Doctor's orders.
Heart condition.</i>

35
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,400
<i>"Angina," he calls it.</i>

36
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,600
<i>I'm polishing my badge and getting myself
used to the idea of saying goodbye to it.</i>

37
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,200
<i>It, and the 30-odd years
of protecting and serving and tears</i>

38
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,720
<i>and the blood and terror
and triumph it represents.</i>

39
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,760
<i>I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile.</i>

40
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,440
<i>About the thick, fat steaks
she picked up at the butcher's today.</i>

41
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,800
<i>And I'm thinking about
the one loose end I haven't tied up.</i>

42
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,600
<i>A young girl who's out there somewhere,
helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic.</i>

43
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,360
Damn it, Hartigan, I won't let you do this.
You're gonna get yourself killed.

44
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,600
You're gonna get us both killed.
I won't let you. I'm warnin' you.

45
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,520
Let go of my coat, Bob.

46
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,520
You're draggin' me down with you.

47
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,880
I'm your partner.
They can kill me, too.

48
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,200
I ain't puttin' up with that. I'm gettin'
on the horn and calling for backup.

49
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,560
Sure, Bob.
We'll just wait.

50
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,400
Sit on our hands while that Roark brat gets
his sick thrills with victim number four.

51
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,520
Victim number four!

52
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,000
Nancy Callahan, age 11.

53
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,280
And she'll be raped
and slashed to ribbons.

54
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,120
And that backup that we're waitin' on
will just so happen to show up

55
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,440
just late enough for Roark
to get back to his US Senator daddy.

56
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,080
Take a deep breath, Hartigan.

57
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,040
Settle down and think straight.

58
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,800
You're pushin' 60
and you got a bum ticker.

59
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,760
You ain't savin' anyone.

60
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,480
You got a great attitude, Bob.

61
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,880
Real credit to the force, you are.

62
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,400
Eileen's at home waitin' for you.
Think about Eileen.

63
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,120
Heck, Bob,

64
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,000
maybe you are right.

65
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,280
I'm glad to hear you're finally talkin' sense.

66
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,800
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership.</i>

67
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,400
<i>Hell of a way to start my retirement.</i>

68
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,160
<i>Nancy Callahan, age 11.</i>

69
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,640
<i>For all I know, she's dead already.</i>

70
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,400
You've been a very good girl, Nancy.

71
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,760
You've been very quiet.

72
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't be scared.

73
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
We're gonna be
taking you home really soon.

74
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,000
But first,
we're going to introduce you to somebody.

75
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,240
He's a very nice man.

76
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,240
<i>Halfway to the warehouse where
Weevil said they took her, and it hits.</i>

77
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,760
<i>Icked spot of indigestion.</i>

78
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,120
<i>At least that's what I pray it is.</i>

79
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,440
...lighthearted
and momentary digression.

80
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,320
The briefest indulge-ment
in automotive pleasure.

81
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,280
For cheap thrills.
Such short-lived durability, Mr. Shlubb.

82
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,640
You would risk engender-ating ill will
on the part of our employers.

83
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,720
<i>Burt Shlubb and Douglas Klump -</i>

84
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,920
<i>two any-dirty-job-there-is thugs
with delusions of eloquence.</i>

85
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,680
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet -

86
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,320
temporarily remanded
to our custody though it may be -

87
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,480
remains the property
of the son of Senator Roark.

88
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,680
<i>Gotta keep this quiet.
Take 'em down fast.</i>

89
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,680
A single dent,
the merest scratch thereupon,

90
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,640
and the before-mentioned consequences
of which I so recently made mention

91
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,160
shall surely be athwart us.

92
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,160
<i>Catch your breath.
Give your heart time to slow down.</i>

93
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,160
<i>But it won't slow down.</i>

94
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,120
<i>Get over it.</i>

95
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,280
<i>She needs you.</i>

96
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,000
We're all done here, Benny.

97
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,440
Let's give them some time together.
Give them some privacy.

98
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,320
Be with you in a minute, Lenny.

99
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,640
I'm just making sure
they get along really well.

100
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,240
And what kind of beast couldn't get along
with a precious little girl like this?

101
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,280
You must be awfully scared now.

102
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,600
But you've got nothing to be scared of.

103
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,360
All we're gonna do is have a nice little talk.

104
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,000
That's all. Just a nice talk.
Just you and me.

105
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,400
Don't you cry now.

106
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
<i>Doctor said it'd be like this.</i>

107
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,800
<i>Just take the pill he gave you.</i>

108
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,360
<i>No need to play it quiet.</i>

109
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,360
<i>Not anymore.</i>

110
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,280
<i>Breathe steady, old man.
Prove you're not completely useless.</i>

111
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,960
<i>What the hell?
Go out with a bang.</i>

112
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,120
<i>He likes to hear 'em scream.</i>

113
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,680
<i>I've seen his victims
and their twisted little faces,</i>

114
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,400
<i>all wide-mouthed and bug-eyed, frozen
in their last horrible moment of living.</i>

115
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,960
<i>No screams.
Either I'm just in time, or I'm way too late.</i>

116
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,080
<i>It's nothing. Barely a flesh wound.
On your feet, old man.</i>

117
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,560
Roark.
Give it up.

118
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,880
Let the girl go.

119
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,000
You can't do
a goddamn thing to me, Hartigan.

120
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,040
You know who I am.

121
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,280
You know who my father is!

122
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,760
You can't touch me, you piece-of-shit cop.

123
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,440
Look at you. You can't even lift
that cannon you're carrying.

124
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,520
Sure, I can.

125
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,640
Cover your eyes, Nancy.
I don't want you watching this.

126
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,600
I mean it, baby.
Cover your eyes right now.

127
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,640
<i>I take his weapons away.</i>

128
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,800
<i>Both of them.</i>

129
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,840
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership.</i>

130
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,800
For God's sakes,
don't make it any worse.

131
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,240
- Don't make me kill you.
- Doin' fine, Bob.

132
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,520
Never better.

133
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,600
I'm ready to kick your ass.

134
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,400
<i>Keep him talking.
Buy time.</i>

135
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,000
<i>Just a few more minutes.
Just till the backup gets here.</i>

136
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,880
Sit down and stay down.
I'll kill you if I have to.

137
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,680
<i>Keep his mind off the girl -
skinny little Nancy.</i>

138
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,440
<i>He can't kill her
once the backup gets here.</i>

139
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,920
Run home, Nancy.
Run for your life.

140
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,800
Don't listen to him.
He's a crazy man.

141
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,040
- What a tough man you are?
- You stay right where you're at.

142
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,920
You shoot your partner in the back...

143
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,040
then you try to scare a little girl.

144
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,240
Maybe I'll pull my spare rod, plug you
a couple of times, show you how it's done.

145
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,400
We could've worked something out,
but you've blown that.

146
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,360
Sit down or I'll blast you in half.

147
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,720
- You're so slow, you'll never stop me.
- Sit down!

148
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,440
You'll never be able to stop me.

149
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,000
<i>I finally sit down,
just like you told me to.</i>

150
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,680
<i>The sirens are close now.</i>

151
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,920
<i>She'll be safe.</i>

152
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,920
<i>Things go dark.
I don't mind much.</i>

153
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,280
<i>Getting sleepy.
It's OK.</i>

154
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,520
<i>She'll be safe.</i>

155
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,960
<i>An old man dies,</i>

156
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,480
<i>a little girl lives.</i>

157
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,520
<i>Fair trade.</i>

158
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,520
<i>The night is hot as hell.</i>

159
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,760
<i>It's a lousy room
in a lousy part of a lousy town.</i>

160
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,280
<i>I'm staring at a goddess.</i>

161
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,680
<i>She's telling me she wants me.</i>

162
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,440
<i>I'm not gonna waste one more second
wondering how I've gotten so lucky.</i>

163
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,000
I want you.

164
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,400
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell.</i>

165
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,800
<i>The perfect woman.</i>

166
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,400
<i>The goddess.</i>

167
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,800
I need you.

168
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
<i>Goldie.</i>

169
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,360
<i>She says her name is Goldie.</i>

170
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,320
<i>Three hours later and my head
is feeling several sizes too big.</i>

171
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,400
<i>And that cold thing
happens to my stomach.</i>

172
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,400
<i>And I realize Goldie's dead.
Not a mark on her.</i>

173
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,680
<i>You'd have to check her pulse
or notice those perfect breasts of hers</i>

174
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,400
<i>aren't moving like they would
if she was breathing.</i>

175
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,200
<i>She was murdered
and I was right here when it happened.</i>

176
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,520
<i>Lying next to her,
stone drunk, just like she was.</i>

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,840
<i>Damn it, Goldie. Who were you
and who wanted you dead?</i>

178
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,240
<i>Who were you
besides an angel of mercy,</i>

179
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,520
<i>giving a two-time loser like me
the night of his life?</i>

180
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,280
<i>It sure as hell wasn't my looks.</i>

181
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,160
<i>So why the sleazy saloon?</i>

182
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,480
<i>Why the kindness, Goldie?</i>

183
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,920
<i>The cops - they're telling me too much,</i>

184
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,840
<i>showing up before anybody
but me and the killer</i>

185
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,040
<i>could know there's been a murder.</i>

186
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,480
<i>Somebody paid good money
for this frame.</i>

187
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,160
<i>No reason at all to play it quiet.</i>

188
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,240
<i>No reason to play it any way but my way.</i>

189
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,480
<i>Whoever killed you is gonna pay, Goldie.</i>

190
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,280
Open up, police!

191
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,040
I'll be right out.

192
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,600
<i>I don't know why you died, Goldie.</i>

193
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,440
<i>I don't know why and I don't know how
I never even met you before tonight,</i>

194
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,120
<i>but you were a friend and more
when I needed one.</i>

195
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,760
<i>And when I find out who did it,</i>

196
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,800
<i>it won't be quick and quiet
like it was with you.</i>

197
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,400
<i>It'll be loud and nasty - my kind of kill.</i>

198
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,360
<i>And when his eyes go dead,
the hell I send him to</i>

199
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,880
<i>will seem like heaven
after what I've done to him.</i>

200
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,320
<i>I love you, Goldie.</i>

201
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,680
Claire?

202
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,440
Now, don't worry, Lucille.
I was just grazed.

203
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,240
- You got any beers around this place?
- No way am I giving you any alcohol.

204
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,280
Besides, it's not what
you came here for anyway, is it?

205
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,960
No.

206
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,480
Go ahead.
You're worse without 'em.

207
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,760
Thanks.
You're the best.

208
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,280
<i>Lucille's my parole officer.</i>

209
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,480
<i>She's a dyke, but God knows why.</i>

210
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,920
<i>Its that body of hers
she could have any man she wants.</i>

211
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
<i>The pills come from a girlfriend
who's a shrink.</i>

212
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,720
<i>She tried to analyze me once
but she got too scared.</i>

213
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,680
Haven't seen you like this in a while.

214
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,040
- Got in a fight with some cops.
- Didn't happen to kill any of them, did ya?

215
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,480
Not that I know of. But they know they've
been in a fight, that's for damn sure.

216
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,240
How the hell do you suppose
I'm gonna square this with the board?

217
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,200
There ain't no squaring it.
Not this time.

218
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,840
This isn't some barroom brawl.

219
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,960
Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone.

220
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,560
Hey, hey.
This is big.

221
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,240
- Settle down, Marv. Take another pill.
- Hey, there ain't no settlin' down!

222
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,120
This is blood for blood, and by the gallons.

223
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,560
This is the old days and the bad days,
the all-or-nothing days.

224
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,600
They're back.
There's no choices left.

225
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,440
And I'm ready for war.

226
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,880
Prison was hell for you, Marv.
It's gonna be life this time.

227
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,280
Hell's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here.

228
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,280
But I'm out now.

229
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,720
It took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it.

230
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,720
But I'm out.
I know exactly what I gotta do.

231
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,280
<i>So you were scared,
weren't you, Goldie?</i>

232
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,880
<i>Somebody wanted you dead
and you knew it.</i>

233
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,600
<i>So you hit the saloons, the bad places,</i>

234
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,800
<i>looking for the biggest,
meanest lug around and finding me.</i>

235
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,440
<i>Well, I'm gonna find
that son of a bitch that killed you,</i>

236
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,280
<i>and I'm gonna give him the hard goodbye.</i>

237
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,440
<i>Walk down
the right back alley in Sin City...</i>

238
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,520
<i>- Leave your hands off Nancy.
... and you could find anything.</i>

239
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,200
That coat looks like Baghdad.

240
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,720
So does your face.
Take off!

241
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,240
He's new here, Marv.
He didn't know.

242
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,640
<i>Kadie's is my kind of joint.</i>

243
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,600
<i>Nancy's just getting started with her gig,
but already the crowd's breathing hard.</i>

244
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,720
<i>Plenty of nights I've drooled over Nancy,</i>

245
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,400
<i>shoulder to shoulder
with all the other losers like me.</i>

246
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,800
<i>But that's not what I'm lookin' for tonight.</i>

247
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,200
What'll it be, Marv?

248
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,040
A shot and a brew, Shellie,
and keep 'em comin'.

249
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,600
Sure, honey.
You take it slow, now.

250
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,680
<i>Most people think Marv is crazy.</i>

251
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,320
<i>He just had the rotten luck
of being born in the wrong century.</i>

252
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,800
<i>He'd be right at home
on some ancient battlefield,</i>

253
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,120
<i>swinging an ax into somebody's face.</i>

254
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,920
<i>Or in a Roman arena
taking a sword to other gladiators like him.</i>

255
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,760
<i>They'd have tossed him girls
like Nancy back then.</i>

256
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,080
Show's over, dickwad.
Drink up.

257
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,920
Now, that's one fine-looking coat
you're wearing there.

258
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,320
Your killin' days are over,
you over-the-hill, do-gooder son of a bitch.

259
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,200
<i>I love hit men. No matter what
you do to them, you don't feel bad.</i>

260
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,200
- Take it off.
- What?

261
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,600
A fine coat like that,
and you're bleeding all over it.

262
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,040
All right, it's all yours.
Oh, God!

263
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,560
It wasn't you losers who killed Goldie.

264
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,880
The guy who did that,
he knew what he was doing.

265
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,080
So tell me, man.
Who sent you?

266
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,240
I don't hear you giving me any names.

267
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,760
So I guess when I shot you in the belly
I aimed a little too high.

268
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,200
You keep holding out on me like this,
and I'm gonna have to get really nasty.

269
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,520
It was Telly...
Telly Stern passed me the order.

270
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,360
He runs the tables over
to the Triple Ace Club.

271
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,680
Thanks again.

272
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,560
<i>Then the damnedest thing happens.</i>

273
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,600
<i>For a second, I smell the angel smell
that belonged to my Goldie.</i>

274
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,040
<i>Just need my medicine, is all.</i>

275
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,160
Bastard.

276
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,240
You're gonna pay for what you did to me.

277
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,600
Feel like talking, Louie?

278
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,080
How many got paid off
for the frame, Louie? Huh?

279
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,840
How many for the kill?

280
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,400
It was Connelly.
He set me up.

281
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,800
He'll never talk.

282
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,760
I don't know about you,
but I'm havin' a ball.

283
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,760
<i>Connelly talks.
They all talk.</i>

284
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,800
And what have been
your sins, my son?

285
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,360
Well, Padre,
I don't want to keep you up all night,

286
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,360
so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch.

287
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,280
These here hands of mine,
they got blood all over 'em.

288
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,400
You're speaking figuratively.

289
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,880
When I need to find something out,
I just go out and look for somebody

290
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,360
that knows more than me,
and I go and I ask them.

291
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,480
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard.

292
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,240
By way of a "for instance",
I killed three men tonight.

293
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,600
Tortured 'em first.

294
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,840
You might say I been
working my way up the food chain.

295
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,560
First two were minnows -
small-time messengers.

296
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,320
But it was Connelly, the money man,
who fingered you, Padre.

297
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,000
Dear Lord, man,
this is a house of God.

298
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,680
Just give me a damn name.

299
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,960
- Roark.
- You really are pushing your luck, Padre,

300
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,880
feeding me garbage like that.

301
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,040
It can't be that big.

302
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,360
There's a farm
at North Cross and Lennox.

303
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,280
It's all there.
Find out for yourself.

304
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,240
And while you're at it,

305
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,400
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for.

306
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
<i>Worth dying for.</i>

307
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,840
<i>Worth killing for.</i>

308
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,160
<i>Worth going to hell for.</i>

309
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,120
Amen.

310
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,280
<i>His keys say the padre drove a Mercedes,</i>

311
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,720
<i>or at least that's what they're
passing off as a Mercedes these days.</i>

312
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,720
<i>Modern cars -
they all look like electric shavers.</i>

313
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,640
Goldie.

314
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,440
Goldie!

315
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,880
It couldn't be Goldie.

316
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,040
<i>It's my own fault, and nobody else's,
that I got confused.</i>

317
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,760
<i>I've been having so much fun
I forgot to take my medicine.</i>

318
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,680
<i>That wasn't Goldie back there.</i>

319
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,120
<i>Goldie's dead,</i>

320
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,000
<i>and that's the whole reason
that I've been doing what I've been doing.</i>

321
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,720
<i>When you got a condition,
it's bad to forget your medicine.</i>

322
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,680
<i>The cold thing, it creeps into my gut
and tells me one more time it won't let go.</i>

323
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,920
<i>This is a bad place, this farm.</i>

324
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,640
<i>People have died here...</i>

325
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,960
<i>...the wrong way.</i>

326
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,480
I don't want to fight, pooch.

327
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,040
I got no gripe with you.

328
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,120
Easy, boy.

329
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,800
<i>No way I was gonna use
my gun on you, buddy.</i>

330
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,480
<i>It's whoever owns you I'm curious about,</i>

331
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,440
<i>because there's blood on your breath,
and I think I know what kind.</i>

332
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,160
<i>So I sniff around to see what's buried.</i>

333
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,360
Here we go.

334
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,400
<i>It's impossible.
Nobody can sneak up on me.</i>

335
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,400
<i>I go blind.
Not a sound. Nobody's that quiet.</i>

336
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,960
<i>Nobody except the one who snuck
into that hotel room two nights ago.</i>

337
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,800
It was you, you bastard.
You killed her.

338
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,360
You killed Goldie.

339
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,000
It was...

340
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,000
<i>I blew it, Goldie.</i>

341
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,040
<i>I found your killer,
but he was better than me.</i>

342
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,600
<i>Too quiet, too quick.</i>

343
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,040
<i>A killer born.</i>

344
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,520
<i>Why didn't he finish the job?</i>

345
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,600
He keeps the heads.
He eats the rest.

346
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,920
- Lucille?
- It's not just that wolf of his.

347
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,640
The wolf just gets scraps.

348
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,600
Bones.

349
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,920
It's him.

350
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,240
He eats people.

351
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,480
- He cooks them like they were steaks.
- Let's get you warm.

352
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,760
Just like they were steaks.

353
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,040
Now he's got both of us.

354
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,200
It's all right.
Take a nice, slow breath.

355
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,680
Just look at the heads on the wall.

356
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
The heads on the wall.

357
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,320
The heads on the wall.

358
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,200
Son of a bitch!
He kept smiling that damned smile.

359
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,280
He made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers.

360
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,960
- He made me watch!
- Oh, Jesus.

361
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,760
He made me watch!

362
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,200
Christ, I could use a cigarette.

363
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,640
<i>Dames.
Sometimes all they gotta do is let it out.</i>

364
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,880
<i>And a few buckets later,
there's no way you'd know.</i>

365
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,480
You've brought us
some big trouble this time, Marv.

366
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,000
Whoever's behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department.

367
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,160
Any leads?

368
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,800
One guy I talked to told me
it was Roark running the show.

369
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,520
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking out
that hooker almost before I did.

370
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,120
- What hooker?
- The one you've been obsessing over.

371
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,200
The dead one.

372
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,360
Goldie.

373
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,800
I didn't know she was a hooker.

374
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,920
Doesn't make any difference
about anything.

375
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,360
- But I didn't know that.
- She was high-class stuff.

376
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,040
She must have shown you quite a time.

377
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,160
Quiet.
There's a car coming.

378
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,320
Kevin!

379
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,920
<i>All I've got is a face... and a name.</i>

380
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,920
I'll see you later, Kevin.

381
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,480
Let's go.

382
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,440
They're done checking the house.

383
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,440
They're coming this way.

384
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,480
Bastards.
I'll show them.

385
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,280
You're not gonna get
either of us killed, Marv.

386
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,000
No, don't shoot!
Please.

387
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,240
Listen to me.
I'm his parole officer.

388
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,680
He's unconscious and unarmed,

389
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,600
so there's no need to kill him.

390
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,800
Captain, the target - there's no sign of him.

391
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,040
Here's a sign!

392
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,800
That there is one
damn fine coat you're wearing.

393
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,600
<i>I keep coming back to that cop I just killed
and what he told me.</i>

394
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,320
<i>I was pretty steamed about
what he'd done to Lucille,</i>

395
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,840
<i>so I took my time
with that son of a bitch.</i>

396
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,040
<i>It wasn't till I showed him
all those pieces of himself that he said it.</i>

397
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,520
<i>Just a name
Patrick Henry Roark, man of the cloth.</i>

398
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,560
<i>Could've become president,
but he chose to serve God.</i>

399
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,000
<i>Along the way, he happened to become
the most powerful man in the state.</i>

400
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,880
<i>He's brought down mayors and governors
like they were nothing.</i>

401
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,360
<i>He even made his rotten brother
a US senator without breaking a sweat.</i>

402
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,240
<i>And here he's gonna get killed
in the name of a dead hooker.</i>

403
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,000
<i>I'm getting used to the idea.
More and more, I'm liking the sound of it.</i>

404
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,960
<i>Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts.</i>

405
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,880
<i>What if I'm wrong?</i>

406
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,720
<i>I've got a condition.</i>

407
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,880
<i>I get confused sometimes.</i>

408
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,720
<i>And with Lucille dead,
I can't get my medicine.</i>

409
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,920
<i>What if I've imagined all of this?</i>

410
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,040
<i>What if I've finally turned into what
they've always said I was gonna turn into?</i>

411
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,440
<i>A maniac.</i>

412
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,800
<i>A psycho killer.</i>

413
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,880
<i>Can't kill a man
without knowing for sure you ought to.</i>

414
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,880
<i>I've gotta know for sure.</i>

415
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,120
<i>The merchandise is on display
by the time I make my way to Old Town.</i>

416
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,840
<i>For an hour or so,
I asked around about Goldie.</i>

417
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,600
<i>I don't get any answers,
but I know I'm bound to.</i>

418
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,720
<i>Lucille said Goldie was a hooker,</i>

419
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,440
<i>and if she was, she has roots here</i>

420
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,240
<i>friends, maybe even family.</i>

421
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,720
You can't be Goldie.
Goldie's dead.

422
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,560
Goldie.
Yeah, sure, right.

423
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,520
I haven't eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now.

424
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,040
No wonder I'm seeing things.

425
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,560
Bastard!

426
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,880
He's crazy.

427
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,880
Hit him again, Wendy.
Harder.

428
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,720
Wait a minute.
Why did she call you Wendy?

429
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,040
Because that's my name, you ape.

430
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,880
Goldie was my sister.
My twin sister.

431
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,200
I guess she was the nice one.

432
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,600
Goldie and the other six - where are they?

433
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,600
What did you do to them?

434
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,080
You crazy goddamn broad.

435
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,000
Just take a look at this mug.

436
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,120
Would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?

437
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,640
None of you would, but Goldie.

438
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,760
And she only did because
she thought I could protect her.

439
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,920
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girls, did they?

440
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,840
But as soon as they had me for a fall guy,
they showed up, guns blazing.

441
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,160
But they didn't get me, and I've been killing
my way to the truth ever since.

442
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,720
So, go ahead, doll.

443
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,320
Shoot me now,
or get the hell out of my way.

444
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,960
Nuts.

445
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,160
OK, I'm glad we got all that sorted out.

446
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,080
- What the hell?
- I tied those knots! That's my specialty!

447
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,960
You sat there and took it,

448
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,880
when you could've taken my gun away
from me any time you wanted to.

449
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,240
Well, sure. I thought I might be able
to talk some sense into you.

450
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,440
And I probably would have had
to paste you one,

451
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,480
and I don't hurt girls.

452
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,840
I need a pair of handcuffs.

453
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,840
What style do you want?
I got a collection.

454
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,720
Just give him the ones
you got with you, Gail.

455
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,560
It was a farm boy named Kevin
who killed Goldie,

456
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,880
but it was Cardinal Roark
who was behind it, and I don't know why.

457
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,280
I know that sounds crazy.

458
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,560
No, it doesn't.
Goldie worked the clergy.

459
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,960
<i>Just like that, a whopper of a puzzle piece
falls smack in my lap.</i>

460
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,360
<i>I'm too dumb to put
the whole picture together yet,</i>

461
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,200
<i>but she fires up two cigarettes and hands
me one, and I taste her lipstick on it.</i>

462
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,600
<i>And suddenly, my heart's pounding
so loud I can't hear anything else.</i>

463
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,040
<i>I want to reach over and touch her
and taste Goldie's sweat one more time.</i>

464
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,200
<i>But she isn't Goldie.</i>

465
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,240
<i>Yeah, yeah.
This'll do.</i>

466
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,560
I'm also gonna be needing a dozen
two-foot lengths of this rubber tubing...

467
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,880
and a spool of razor wire...

468
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,960
and a pair of those special gloves
that'll let me handle the wire.

469
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,880
Beefing up
the old home security, huh?

470
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,400
You can bet your ass.

471
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,640
She was my sister,
so I'm in this one to the end.

472
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,080
But why are you willing to go up against
Roark for someone you barely knew?

473
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,160
She was nice to me, gave me
something I didn't even know existed.

474
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,520
I wasn't never even able to buy a woman.

475
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,280
You know, the way I look.

476
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,720
<i>I take my mind off her
and I crawl back inside myself.</i>

477
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,640
<i>It's almost killing time,
and I'd better get sharp.</i>

478
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,760
<i>I check the list
rubber tubing, gas, saw,</i>

479
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,720
<i>gloves, cuffs, razor wire, hatchet,</i>

480
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,920
<i>Gladys and my mitts.</i>

481
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,800
- We're close enough. Pull over.
- Yes, Marv.

482
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,320
Keep the engine runnin'.

483
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,000
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you get
the hell outta here and don't look back.

484
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,920
Kill him for me, Marv.

485
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,920
Kill him good.

486
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,680
I won't let you down, Goldie.

487
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,080
<i>Heading downstairs to the kitchen.</i>

488
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,560
<i>Getting himself a midnight snack,
and I can guess what kind.</i>

489
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,400
Come on, you son of a bitch.

490
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,120
<i>Damn, he's slick.</i>

491
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,080
Is that the best you can do, creep?

492
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,600
<i>That's right.
Get personal, get close. I can take it.</i>

493
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,960
I got you, you little bastard.
Let's see you hop around now.

494
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,280
<i>I try to slow my heart down
and breathe the fire out of my lungs.</i>

495
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,840
<i>My muscles make me
a thousand promises of pain to come.</i>

496
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,560
Let me do it, Marv.
She was my sister. Let me finish him.

497
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,080
You wasn't supposed
to come down here, Wendy.

498
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,800
Oh, but I want to...

499
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,800
<i>I'm sorry, kid,
but I haven't even started with this creep,</i>

500
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,920
<i>and I don't want you watching the rest.
It'll give you nightmares.</i>

501
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,880
God, I gotta tell you, I'm good and bushed.

502
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,040
And it's not that fight of ours
that did me in, either.

503
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,880
It's all that sawing and tying.

504
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,080
It's not as easy as it looks.

505
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:51,240
Could have been a real mess around here
if I didn't have that tubing for tourniquets.

506
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,600
I gotta admit,
there was a spurt or two,

507
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,760
to get the scent in the air,
to get that friend of yours to come running.

508
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,880
Well, what do you know?

509
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,200
Look who's here.

510
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,680
Here he comes.

511
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,760
That's a good dog.

512
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,680
<i>He doesn't scream,
not even when the mutt's had its fill</i>

513
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,280
<i>and Kevin's guts
are lying all over the place.</i>

514
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,040
<i>Somehow the bastard is still alive,
still staring at me.</i>

515
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,120
<i>Not even when I grab the saw
and finish the job.</i>

516
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,920
<i>He never screams.</i>

517
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,760
<i>I put in a call to Kadie's
and ask Nancy to get her clothes on</i>

518
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,120
<i>and meet me at her place.
She says, "Yes," like always.</i>

519
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,840
Hey, Nancy, you got any beers?

520
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,760
Sure, Marv.
Who's the babe?

521
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,640
<i>There isn't much of anything
Nancy wouldn't do for me.</i>

522
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,280
<i>Not since a year back
when a frat boy roughed her up</i>

523
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,640
<i>and I straightened him out but good.</i>

524
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,240
<i>It really gets my goat
when guys rough up dames.</i>

525
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,000
So, what do you want me to do with her?

526
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,520
Well, your best bet is
drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks.

527
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,560
What about you?
Are you leaving town?

528
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,280
Hell, no.
I like it here.

529
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,840
<i>I hot-wire a parked cab
and stay under the speed limit</i>

530
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,120
<i>so as not to get any attention.</i>

531
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,280
<i>My head starts to clear.
Things start to make sense.</i>

532
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,160
<i>I owe you, Goldie.</i>

533
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,560
<i>I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up.</i>

534
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,480
<i>So, if going after Roark
means dying, win or lose -</i>

535
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,880
<i>hell, I'll die laughing
if I know I've done this one thing right.</i>

536
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,840
Quiet as a grave out here.
No sign of target.

537
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,520
<i>All right, keep a lookout.</i>

538
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,920
- Kevin?
- What's left of him, anyways.

539
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,120
The dog ate the rest.

540
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,480
Oh, my God.
You monster.

541
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,240
You demon.

542
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,680
Don't scream or I'll plug you.

543
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:34,680
He had the voice of an angel,
yet he spoke only to me.

544
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,480
And he's dead now
because of one stupid whore.

545
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:44,000
It's not a real good idea for you to talk
about Goldie that way while I'm around.

546
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,200
When he came to me...

547
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,840
he was a tormented boy.

548
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,240
Tormented by guilt.

549
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,400
I tried to counsel him.

550
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,160
But the eating - it filled him with white light.

551
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,120
Tearful, he swore to me
that he felt the touch of God Almighty.

552
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,000
What the hell do you know?

553
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,440
I know it's pretty damn weird to eat people.

554
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,320
He didn't just eat their bodies,

555
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,760
he ate their souls.

556
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,600
And I joined in.

557
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,840
They were all whores.

558
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,600
Nobody cared for them.
Nobody missed them.

559
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,840
And then your Goldie
almost ruined everything.

560
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,160
<i>She stayed in public places.</i>

561
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,480
<i>And then with you.</i>

562
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,920
<i>You were so convenient.</i>

563
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,080
<i>You'd broke a man's jaw that very night.</i>

564
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,640
Who would believe a thug like you?

565
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,240
<i>Kevin killed her.</i>

566
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,880
<i>I ordered the police in for you,
but you wouldn't be caught.</i>

567
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,360
<i>You wouldn't stop.</i>

568
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,240
And now he's dead and you're here to...

569
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,600
eliminate me.

570
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,680
Will that give you satisfaction, my son?

571
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:13,120
Killing a helpless old fart?

572
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,880
The killing, no.

573
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,680
No satisfaction.

574
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,160
Everything up until the killing will be a gas.

575
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,040
Kevin...

576
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,520
we're going home.

577
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,440
You can scream now if you want to.

578
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,320
<i>It's beautiful, Goldie.
It's just like I promised, only better.</i>

579
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,840
<i>And when his eyes go dead,</i>

580
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,000
<i>the hell I sent him to must seem like
heaven after what I've done to him.</i>

581
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,920
- Freeze!
- Oh, my God!

582
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,920
<i>Jerks.</i>

583
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,640
<i>They should've shot me in the head,
and enough times to make sure.</i>

584
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,400
<i>It's so stupid.</i>

585
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,280
<i>Everybody knows what's coming,
but they go through the motions anyway.</i>

586
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,480
<i>What a waste of time.</i>

587
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,800
<i>Months fall off the calendar
while I breathe and eat through tubes.</i>

588
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,640
<i>Night after night, I wait for somebody
to come and finish me off.</i>

589
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,360
<i>After a while,
I realize it's not gonna be so easy as that.</i>

590
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,880
<i>I'm on my feet for about ten minutes</i>

591
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,760
<i>before the cops kick them out
from under me.</i>

592
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,800
<i>They don't ask me any questions.</i>

593
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,120
<i>They just keep knocking the crap out of
me and waving a confession in my face.</i>

594
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,160
<i>And I keep spitting blood all over it</i>

595
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,600
<i>and laughing at how many fresh copies
they come up with.</i>

596
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,040
<i>Then along comes this worm assistant
district attorney who turns the recorder off</i>

597
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,360
<i>and says if I don't sign their confession,
they'll kill my mom.</i>

598
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,760
<i>I break his arm in three places
and I sign it.</i>

599
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,800
<i>From then on,
it's the circus everybody wants it to be.</i>

600
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,120
<i>They nail me for the works -
not just the people I did kill,</i>

601
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,200
<i>but even Lucille and the girls
that Roark and Kevin ate,</i>

602
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,600
<i>and even Goldie.</i>

603
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,640
<i>The judge is all fire and brimstone
when she hands down the sentence.</i>

604
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,520
<i>Midnight and my death
are only a few hours away,</i>

605
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,680
<i>when I get my first surprise in 18 months.</i>

606
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,520
<i>My only visitor.</i>

607
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,440
<i>I'm ready for anything but that scent.</i>

608
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,480
I got 'em for you good,
didn't I, Goldie?

609
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,960
Oh, I'm sorry, Wendy.

610
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,120
I got confused again.

611
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,720
Just seeing you like this.

612
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,440
You can call me Goldie.

613
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,080
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell.</i>

614
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,680
<i>The perfect woman.</i>

615
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,480
<i>The goddess.</i>

616
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,800
<i>Goldie.</i>

617
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,400
<i>She says her name is Goldie.</i>

618
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,280
<i>They fix me a pretty decent steak
for my last meal.</i>

619
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,720
<i>They even throw in a brew.
It's the first I've had since back at Nancy's.</i>

620
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:31,320
<i>Then they shave my head and fix me
with a rubber diaper and get to it.</i>

621
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,120
<i>And it's about damned time,
if you ask me.</i>

622
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,640
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death... "

623
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,320
Would you get a move on?
I haven't got all night.

624
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,960
You heard the man.
Hit it.

625
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,800
Is that the best you can do, you pansies?

626
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,520
He's gone.

627
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,720
Forget it, man.

628
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,760
You can bang on that door
all night if you want to.

629
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,320
There is no way in hell I'm letting you in.

630
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,720
I can't believe
you're doing this to me, Shellie.

631
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,960
Everything we've shared -
it has to mean something to you.

632
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,760
Ha. It meant plenty.

633
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,880
Plenty of lost pay on account of how
nobody wants to flirt with a waitress

634
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,520
whose face is all purple
and swollen up with bruises.

635
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,080
I know you're angry, baby.

636
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,200
And I forgive you for that
without you even asking me to.

637
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,040
There's a difference
between getting honked off

638
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,760
at a guy who's generally not so bad,

639
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,800
and finding out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk loser

640
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,360
who skips out on a wife
that he doesn't even tell you about

641
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,040
every time he gets drunk,
which is way too often!

642
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,880
Especially the kind of total jerk loser

643
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,800
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man.

644
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,160
That hurt, Shellie.

645
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,600
It's one thing for you to play hard to get,
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off.

646
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,120
I am impossible to get.

647
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:26,440
Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy,
and get help, like a shrink.

648
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,240
Get help and get lost.

649
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,920
Just open the door.

650
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,680
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie.
I'll take care of this.

651
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,680
Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me.

652
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,480
Oblige him, Shellie.
I'm ready for him.

653
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,080
No! If he knew that you were here with me,
you don't know how bad this could get!

654
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,480
This clown's got a big, mean drunk on.

655
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,600
And he's got four friends
out there in the hall,

656
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,200
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is.

657
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,000
Hey, I could swear I heard somebody
in there with you just now.

658
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:06,400
Somebody! Jackie Boy,
it's a regular African love fest in here!

659
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,920
- I'm no racist.
- I mean, I got me all five starters,

660
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,000
and half the bench of
the Basin City Blues keeping me company.

661
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,120
You feel like taking them on?

662
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,120
You are teasing me, baby.

663
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,600
Some of my best friends...

664
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,200
But you're really pushing my buttons.

665
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,440
And the whole time
you've been doing me like this,

666
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,240
I've been too polite to point out
that at any time I want to,

667
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,360
I could kick this damn door to splinters.

668
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,200
OK, baby, you know what I can do.

669
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,520
- You know what I can do. One, two...
- All right, then!

670
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,440
All right.
All right, all right!

671
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,400
Troops, make yourself at home.

672
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,640
You brought your whole pack with you?

673
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,440
None of these bozos got lives,
they gotta hang out with you?

674
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,080
You're gonna love this, baby.

675
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,880
You're gonna call up some of your friends
who work the saloon.

676
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,280
With you and the bunch of us,
we're gonna hit every joint in town,

677
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,120
and it's gonna be great.

678
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,240
I ain't calling up nobody.

679
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:21,160
That's a man's shirt,
and I'm sure as hell it ain't one of mine.

680
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,440
You got somebody's love stink all over you.

681
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,720
You've been with another man
and you've been with him tonight.

682
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,120
- Who is he?
- He's Superman.

683
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,040
He flew out the window
just as soon as he heard you were coming,

684
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,520
'cause you scared him so bad.

685
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,480
You think
I have no feelings at all.

686
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,600
If you're gonna slug me,

687
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,560
just go ahead and get it over with,
you sick bastard.

688
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,600
There you go,
lying about me again,

689
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,160
right in front of my friends.

690
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,400
I have never hit a woman in my life.

691
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,920
That's showing her, man.

692
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,320
You goddamn bastard.
You goddamn coward.

693
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,240
Baby, we're all here to have a good time.

694
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,960
I gotta take a leak.

695
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,400
Wish you'd dropped by earlier, Jackie Boy.

696
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,920
Then you could've met my boyfriend.

697
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,400
Could've seen what a real man looks like.

698
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,160
There you go, after my nuts again.

699
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,400
But I forgive you.

700
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,400
I'm a generous guy.

701
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,760
He is generous.
But that temper of his...

702
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,800
You never should have
picked on him like you did.

703
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,280
My temper you don't have to worry about.

704
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,280
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or I'll cut your little pecker off.

705
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,920
I've been told.

706
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,600
Hey, baby,
I don't hear you making those calls.

707
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,320
Answer me!

708
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,400
I don't need this grief.

709
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:09,120
Hi. I'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and I'm out of my mind.

710
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,880
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again,
you even think her name,

711
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,440
and I'll cut you in ways
that'll make you useless to a woman.

712
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,840
You're making a big mistake, man.
A big mistake.

713
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:27,000
Yeah?
You already made a big mistake yourself.

714
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,360
You didn't flush.

715
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,160
Troops, get outta here.

716
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,320
No questions, damn it.
No questions.

717
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,160
Now!

718
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,240
Dwight, what in the devil
did you do to him?

719
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,120
I just gave him a taste of his own medicine.

720
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,240
I don't think he'll be bothering you again.

721
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,080
- How's your jaw?
- I've been slapped around worse.

722
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,000
Dwight, he was from a while back,

723
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,240
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours.

724
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,920
And it was only 'cause I felt sorry for him.

725
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,320
And it was only once.

726
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,320
I've done some dumb things.

727
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,280
Seeing as how
I'm one of those dumb things,

728
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,960
I can't give you
too hard a time about that, Shellie.

729
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,080
But this guy, he's a menace.

730
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,920
He might kill somebody if I don't stop him.

731
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,400
I'll call you later.

732
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,880
No, don't go!

733
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,200
<i>Shellie shouts something
I can't quite make out</i>

734
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,840
<i>over the racket of a passing police 'copter.</i>

735
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,440
<i>- Stop!
- It sounds like "stop," but I can't be sure.</i>

736
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,520
<i>It's a chance I shouldn't be taking,
but I can't just go home and forget about it,</i>

737
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,800
<i>and let Jackie Boy and his pals
find their fun.</i>

738
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,240
<i>They're a pack of predators and they're
out for blood tonight - a woman's blood.</i>

739
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,480
Damn it, Dwight.
Damn it.

740
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,400
You fool.

741
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,640
You damned fool.

742
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,400
<i>I cut my Caddy across the park</i>

743
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,880
<i>to pick up Jackie Boy heading
like a bat outta hell up the hill.</i>

744
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,880
<i>I'm speeding.</i>

745
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,560
<i>That's a good way to get yourself noticed.
And if you're a murderer with a new face</i>

746
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,800
<i>who's one fingerprint check away from
the fast track to the gas chamber like I am,</i>

747
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,880
<i>the last thing you want
is to get noticed.</i>

748
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:21,440
<i>I don't have nearly enough cash on me
to bribe this cop, and even if I did,</i>

749
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,520
<i>there's always the outside chance
he's one of the honest ones.</i>

750
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:30,040
<i>Do I try to talk my way out of this,
or do I take this cop down and risk it all?</i>

751
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,240
<i>Then Jackie Boy saves me
a great, big, steaming pile of trouble.</i>

752
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,800
Watch it, Jack!

753
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,200
Cops!
They're right on our ass!

754
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,640
Not for long.
Not where we're headed.

755
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,680
<i>My gut tightens up.</i>

756
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,920
<i>Jackie Boy's leading us
straight to Old Town.</i>

757
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,160
<i>The cop shuts off his siren.</i>

758
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,360
<i>He knows he's not the law,
not in Old Town.</i>

759
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,560
<i>The ladies are the law here,
beautiful and merciless.</i>

760
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,520
<i>If you've got the cash
and you play by the rules,</i>

761
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,840
<i>they'll make all your dreams come true.</i>

762
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,560
<i>But if you cross 'em, you're a corpse.</i>

763
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,840
Hey, baby.

764
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,680
Hop in, sugar.
We'll get you there.

765
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:34,400
Sweetheart. I work the day shift
and it's been a long day.

766
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,400
Besides, I don't do group jobs.

767
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,320
Get in the car, baby.
We'll just talk. It'll be nice.

768
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,360
I don't do talk jobs, either.

769
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,280
Babydoll,
I've had me one hell of a bad day.

770
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,880
I've been beat up every time I turn around.

771
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,000
But the day I get turned down by a hooker

772
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:57,520
when I got good,
hard-earned cash to pay her with...

773
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,920
well...

774
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,360
there's only so much a man can take.

775
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,520
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street.

776
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,880
That's the Alamo, not the Amigo.

777
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,440
The Amigo's a fag joint.

778
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,680
Are you having a good time humiliating me
like this for no damn reason at all?

779
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,040
That's far enough, Dwight.
We've been on top of these peckerwoods

780
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,520
since they first showed up
with that cop behind them.

781
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,560
Everything's under control.

782
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,680
Enjoy the show.

783
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,560
<i>There's no use arguing with her.</i>

784
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,400
<i>The ladies are their own enforcers.</i>

785
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,360
So, how's the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up?

786
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,240
Not right now, Gail.

787
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,040
Wound up a little tight, aren't we?

788
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,160
That's your whole problem, Dwight.
You worry too much.

789
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,160
That, and your lousy taste in women.
These days, anyway.

790
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,120
Damn it, Gail.
Not right now.

791
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,960
Those clowns down the way -
they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?

792
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,040
One of them thinks he is.

793
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,000
He's outta control.

794
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,400
I followed them here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girls.

795
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,920
Us helpless little girls.

796
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:11,400
<i>All kinds of death is about to hit
less than 20 yards ahead of us,</i>

797
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,960
<i>and still it's hard to take my eyes off her.</i>

798
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,640
Us girls are safe as we can be, Lancelot.

799
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,080
Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away

800
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,480
from seeing what Miho can do.

801
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,400
And she's been aching for some practice.

802
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,880
<i>She guides my glance upwards
to the pixie perched on the roof's edge.</i>

803
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,960
<i>- Deadly little Miho.
- You're running out of alley, cowboy.</i>

804
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,160
Turn around. Save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief.

805
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,800
You're a sassy little thing.

806
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,480
You ain't hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats.

807
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,480
<i>The trap is set,
locked and ready to spring.</i>

808
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,240
<i>So what? They're scum.
They deserve what's coming.</i>

809
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,560
<i>So why this rotten feeling in my gut
that something is awfully wrong?</i>

810
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,760
They haven't killed anybody I know about.

811
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:06,320
It got pretty bad at Shellie's place,
but they didn't kill anybody.

812
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,760
And they won't.

813
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,840
<i>Why this rotten feeling?</i>

814
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,280
<i>Something Shellie said.
I can't place it.</i>

815
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,440
OK, OK, OK. I sounded off
a little more than I should have.

816
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,360
- I'm a little on edge.
- Over the edge.

817
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,560
It's not a woman you need.
It's a good night's sleep.

818
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:27,280
You couldn't handle a woman,
the state you're in.

819
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,720
She's saying you ain't got
what it takes, Jack.

820
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,920
You wanna see it?

821
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,320
You wanna see what I got?

822
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,240
I've seen all shapes, all sizes.

823
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,720
You seen this one?

824
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,160
Get in the car.

825
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,680
Oh, sugar, you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life.

826
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,400
Oh, God, no!

827
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,000
This is crazy!

828
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,320
Out of nowhere, for no reason at all!

829
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,960
Go ahead.

830
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,320
- He's got the drop on her.
- He's got squat.

831
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,080
He's dead.
He's just too damn dumb to know it.

832
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,440
I got you right where I want you.

833
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,560
This is a career-ending wound, whore.

834
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:49,000
- And there's gonna be hell to pay.
- Watch your step, Jackie Boy.

835
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,600
This isn't funny.

836
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,760
Don't anyone laugh.
I got friends you can't imagine.

837
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,000
Every one of you is gonna burn.

838
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,840
Hang it up.
She's just playing with you.

839
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,040
- You're only making it worse.
- You shut the hell up.

840
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:20,320
<i>Don't pull the trigger.
She blocked the barrel. It'll backfire.</i>

841
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,080
I told you to shut up.

842
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,920
I can't see.

843
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,960
What's happening?

844
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,760
I can't see.

845
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,440
I can't hear anything.

846
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,840
For God's sake, Miho, finish him.

847
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,320
Make it quick, will you?

848
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,080
<i>She doesn't quite chop his head off.</i>

849
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,880
<i>She makes a Pez dispenser out of him.</i>

850
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,160
<i>Then it's straight to business - stretching
the corpses out on the alley floor</i>

851
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:06,280
<i>and going through their pockets,
divvying up cash when they find it.</i>

852
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,320
<i>I'm fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants.</i>

853
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,160
<i>His wallet is packed.</i>

854
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:14,040
<i>Mastercard, Discover,
Platinum American Express,</i>

855
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,280
<i>and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties</i>

856
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:20,160
<i>that I'm not too proud
to stuff into my own pockets.</i>

857
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,000
<i>Then I find an atom bomb.</i>

858
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,480
<i>Jackie Boy,</i>

859
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,880
<i>you son of a bitch.</i>

860
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,720
<i>There was a helicopter
that kicked up such a racket,</i>

861
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,840
<i>I couldn't quite make out what she said.</i>

862
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,200
<i>I thought Shellie said "stop. "</i>

863
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,800
<i>She said "cop. "</i>

864
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,920
<i>Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty.</i>

865
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,240
<i>Iron Jack, the papers call him.</i>

866
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,920
<i>A goddamn hero cop.</i>

867
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,040
<i>It's held for years, the shaky truce.</i>

868
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:01,960
<i>The cops get a slice of the profits and free
entertainment when they throw a party.</i>

869
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,720
<i>The girls get to administer
their own brand of justice.</i>

870
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,600
<i>They get to defend their own turf.
If a cop blunders into the neighborhood</i>

871
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,880
<i>and he's not shopping for what the girls
are selling, they send him packing,</i>

872
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,520
<i>but they send him back alive.</i>

873
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,600
<i>That's the rules.</i>

874
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,520
<i>That's the truce.</i>

875
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,000
<i>The cops stay out.</i>

876
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:26,080
<i>That keeps the girls free
to keep the pimps and the mob out.</i>

877
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,000
<i>Old Town will be left wide open.</i>

878
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,960
<i>It'll be war.</i>

879
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,360
<i>The streets will run red with blood -</i>

880
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,680
<i>women's blood.</i>

881
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,040
The cops!
The mob!

882
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,760
Things are gonna go back
to the way they used to be!

883
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,520
The hell they will!
We got guns.

884
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,560
We'll fight the cops and the mob

885
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,960
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us.

886
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,560
- We'll go to war.
- Don't be stupid.

887
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,840
You wouldn't stand a chance.
Get me a car.

888
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,920
Make sure it's a hardtop
with a decent engine.

889
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,320
I'll hide the bodies.

890
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,720
Did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here?

891
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,200
The cops know Rafferty came here.

892
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,240
They'll check the river,
they'll check the sewer.

893
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,120
They'll find him
and come gunning for us.

894
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,000
I'll haul the bodies to the pits.
The cops won't check the pits.

895
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,880
Get that gun out of my face or I'll smack ya.

896
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,960
Who do you think you are, giving orders?

897
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,520
- You got what you wanted out of us.
- Shut up, Gail.

898
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,200
You got what you wanted out of me!

899
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,760
And you were gone,
off playing with that barmaid.

900
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:32,880
Gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us.

901
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,560
<i>Miho moves to my back.</i>

902
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,600
<i>One word from Gail
and she'll cut me in half.</i>

903
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,200
They'll be watching the roads.
They'll catch you.

904
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,400
It'll be the bad old days all over again.

905
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,080
The pimps, the beatings,
the drugs, the rapes!

906
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:52,920
They won't be watching the roads. Not yet,
they won't! Get me a damn hardtop!

907
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,160
If I don't make it, you can have your war.

908
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,720
Get that gun out of my face now!

909
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,000
Bastard!

910
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,680
I forgot how quick you are.

911
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,200
<i>My warrior woman.</i>

912
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,760
<i>She almost yanks my head clean off,</i>

913
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,960
<i>shoving my mouth into hers
so hard it hurts.</i>

914
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,320
<i>An explosion that blasts away
the dull, gray years</i>

915
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:25,520
<i>between the now and that one fiery night
when she was mine.</i>

916
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,040
A hardtop with a decent engine.

917
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,400
And make sure it's got a big trunk.

918
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,360
I'll always love you, baby.

919
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,200
Always... and never.

920
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,880
Where'd you find that heap?

921
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:53,320
Just look at that trunk.
We'll never fit 'em all in.

922
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,760
Gail? Unless there's something else
you want me to do,

923
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,760
you think maybe I could go home?

924
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:02,840
All this blood and stuff's got me kind of
feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl.

925
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,040
Sure, Becky, go home.

926
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,800
But don't you talk to anybody,
not even your mom.

927
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,680
They'll never fit in that trunk.

928
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:14,360
Not like this, they won't.
Miho.

929
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,640
Dry your hair as soon as you get home!

930
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,760
You'll catch cold if you don't.

931
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,480
Hey, Becky.
Gail said no calls.

932
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:36,200
I just want to hear my mom's voice.
I won't tell her nothing.

933
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,800
Please, don't say nothing to Gail.

934
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,680
Hey, Mom?

935
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,080
<i>Dizzy dames.</i>

936
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,960
<i>What were they thinking, sticking me
with a beat-up bucket of bolts like this?</i>

937
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,680
<i>We were barely able to get the trunk
to stay closed as it was,</i>

938
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,320
<i>we packed it so tight.</i>

939
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,120
<i>There wasn't anything we could do
but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me,</i>

940
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,920
<i>out where anybody who cares to look
will see him.</i>

941
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,800
<i>Go ahead, take one of his cigarettes.</i>

942
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,560
<i>It'll help.</i>

943
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:40,240
It's got you smoking there, bud.

944
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,520
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy.

945
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,680
You're dead.

946
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,800
I'm just imagining this, so shut the hell up.

947
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:58,600
Well, it tells you something
about your state of mind, don't it?

948
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,040
It's got you hearing things.

949
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,120
It's got your nerves shot.

950
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,680
It's got you smoking.

951
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:10,560
You know it's true.

952
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,120
Nobody ever really quits.

953
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:20,200
A smoker's a smoker
when the chips are down.

954
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:25,000
- And your chips are down.
- I'm fine. You shut the hell up.

955
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,880
Will you look at that?

956
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,680
Those hookers let you down.

957
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,840
What are you gonna do
when you run outta gas, call AAA?

958
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:44,000
You sucker for the babes, you.

959
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,960
You ain't even gonna make it to the pits.

960
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:50,000
You shut the hell up.
I'll make it.

961
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,400
Not unless you keep
your eyes on the road, sugar pie.

962
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,400
Watch it!

963
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,720
This is great.

964
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,080
Just like being in a buddy movie.

965
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,360
Shut up!

966
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,200
Boy, you're screwed.

967
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,240
It's over.

968
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,720
You're flushed.

969
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,240
This time, I can't bring myself
to tell him to shut up.

970
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,560
Sure, he's an asshole.

971
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,160
Sure, he's dead.

972
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,680
Sure, I'm just imagining that he's talking.

973
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,680
None of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right.

974
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,040
I don't have a chance in hell
of outrunning this cop.

975
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,280
Not in this heap.

976
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,760
Pull over!

977
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,600
The only question left
is whether I'm gonna kill him or not.

978
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:49,000
Tough call.

979
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:52,160
For all I know,
he's an honest cop, regular guy,

980
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:56,320
a working stiff with a mortgage,
a wife and a pile of kids.

981
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,560
My hand moves all on its own,

982
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,480
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer.

983
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:09,240
- I don't know what to do.
- You better stop. You're making him mad.

984
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,320
Whatever you say.

985
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,560
Your friend here...
party a little too hard tonight?

986
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,680
I'm the designated driver.

987
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,280
Well, you're driving with a busted tail light.

988
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,360
I'll let you off with a warning.

989
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,280
What next?

990
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:00,920
<i>The tank goes dry
a quarter mile from the pits.</i>

991
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,840
<i>I shove the T-Bird the rest of the way.</i>

992
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:07,000
<i>A few minutes' more work
and it'll all be over.</i>

993
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:10,320
<i>Jackie Boy
will go into the damn tar pits,</i>

994
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,440
<i>I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks,
go home and call it a...</i>

995
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,400
No more questions, Dallas.
Do what I say.

996
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,040
Clear the streets.
We're in lockdown.

997
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,760
We're not selling any tail in Old Town.

998
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,040
Not tonight.

999
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,800
Don't struggle.
You'll only hurt yourself.

1000
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,040
Your cause is lost.

1001
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,800
We know everything.

1002
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,720
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty
will be in our possession,

1003
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:55,600
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered.

1004
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,720
There'll be arrests.
There'll be deaths.

1005
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:02,520
My employer will seize
what remains of this neighborhood.

1006
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,000
You will all be slaves.
Nothing can stop this.

1007
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:11,880
But it is within your power
to save many lives

1008
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:16,160
by facilitating the process of transition,

1009
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:21,360
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of Old Town.

1010
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,360
Son of a bitch!
I know you.

1011
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:29,320
I have suffered your kind before -
the dregs of Sin City.

1012
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,360
I serve a new master now,

1013
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:36,080
and soon you and all your wretched kind
will serve him as well.

1014
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:41,360
Now, get dressed and shed a tear
for Dwight McCarthy if you must,

1015
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,880
because, by now, he is surely dead.

1016
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,600
You don't know him.

1017
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:50,760
My man will find a way.

1018
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,800
He always finds a way.

1019
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,160
I can't fathom
these Americans always whining

1020
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,440
and going on about how they got it so bad.

1021
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,720
This is a fine, grand country.

1022
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,080
Guiding light of the modern world, it is.

1023
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,280
Low taxes, land of opportunity.

1024
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,800
Where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that we're getting for this?

1025
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,400
Sure beats the living hell
out of blowing up airports and churches

1026
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,760
without shite to show for it.

1027
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,520
Yeesh.

1028
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,080
You find something, Murphy?

1029
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,280
Looks to be a poor, dead cop's badge.

1030
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,280
It's all bent up.

1031
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,080
What's this stuck in it?

1032
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,160
Bloody hell.
It's the bullet.

1033
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,520
You son of a bitch!
Bastard!

1034
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,000
<i>They weren't cops, these four.</i>

1035
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,960
<i>They were mercenaries.</i>

1036
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,240
<i>And if they were hired
by who I think they were,</i>

1037
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,120
<i>the bad times haven't even started yet.</i>

1038
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,520
<i>And everything seemed
to be going so well.</i>

1039
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,960
Remember, we don't have to
deliver every last inch of the man, Brian.

1040
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,240
You got a good point there, Ronnie.

1041
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,440
Lend me your knife.

1042
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,440
Should I take a nap
while I'm doing all this waiting?

1043
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,400
I'm at the bone, all right?

1044
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,600
There we go.

1045
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:38,400
Have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life?

1046
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,800
We'll be back for the three of you,
and if anyone happens by,

1047
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,640
use your imagination, OK?

1048
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,280
<i>Silence, now.</i>

1049
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,640
<i>No air to breathe.</i>

1050
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:03,640
<i>Only the horrid, oily tar taste
creeping up my nostrils.</i>

1051
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:09,000
<i>Let it in.
Let it fill your lungs.</i>

1052
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,560
<i>They were counting on you
and you blew it.</i>

1053
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:17,680
<i>Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist.</i>

1054
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:21,280
<i>Miho, you're an angel.</i>

1055
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,200
<i>You're a saint.</i>

1056
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,360
<i>You're Mother Teresa.</i>

1057
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,400
<i>You're Elvis.</i>

1058
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,640
<i>You're God.</i>

1059
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:35,680
<i>And if you'd shown up ten minutes
earlier, we'd still have Jackie Boy's head.</i>

1060
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,960
Dwight, they got Gail!

1061
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,040
It's a cinch.
You got yourselves a spy in Old Town.

1062
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,920
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob.

1063
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,320
We gotta find out who it is and rescue Gail.

1064
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,320
But first, we gotta get
our hands on Jackie Boy's head

1065
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:54,400
before it gets to wherever it's going
and this whole situation blows wide open.

1066
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:59,480
Miho, I hope to hell
you left one of 'em alive enough to talk.

1067
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:10,200
<i>I let him know I'm not fooling around.</i>

1068
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,760
<i>We talk.</i>

1069
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:29,080
<i>Stay smart.
Stay cool.</i>

1070
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:32,480
<i>It's time to prove to your friends
that you're worth a damn.</i>

1071
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,560
<i>Sometimes, that means dying.</i>

1072
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:39,000
<i>Sometimes, it means killing
a whole lot of people.</i>

1073
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,480
There they are.
What do we do?

1074
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,640
We stop 'em, Dallas.

1075
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,600
<i>Jackie Boy's head is so close to me</i>

1076
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:57,360
<i>I could almost reach out
and grab it right then and there.</i>

1077
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,480
Get the head!

1078
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,080
I got it!

1079
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,360
Suck on this, you stupid slag!

1080
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,800
<i>I can't tell if Miho is alive or dead,</i>

1081
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:28,400
<i>but I'm on my feet and every ounce of me
wants to get some killing done.</i>

1082
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:35,360
You want the head now, sweetheart?
So come down and get it!

1083
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,040
Brave lad.

1084
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,800
I could've put a bullet
straight down your ear just now,

1085
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:49,480
if I hadn't got me revolver
all wet and useless.

1086
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,760
You got the drop on me, love.

1087
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,240
I'm as helpless as a baby.

1088
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,680
I got to come clean with you, sweetheart.

1089
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:08,560
It was an outright lie I was giving ya
about me revolver being wet.

1090
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,160
You see, I'm not too fond of shootin'.

1091
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,200
It's my preference to blow things up.

1092
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,560
Once you blast the roof off a pub

1093
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,280
and seen all the parts flying off people,

1094
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:24,120
a little bang bang's
never gonna match the sight of that.

1095
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:29,720
And here's me, with all these fine grenades
and such a sweet beauty of a remote.

1096
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:33,120
But it's me knife I'll be doing you with.

1097
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,720
You killed me mates.

1098
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:40,080
Someone shoulda told ya - never give
an Irishman good cause for revenge.

1099
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:44,040
<i>Deadly little Miho.</i>

1100
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,520
<i>You won't feel a thing
unless she wants you to.</i>

1101
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,280
<i>She twists the blade.</i>

1102
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,040
<i>He feels it.</i>

1103
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,360
<i>I tell Miho what we're gonna do
and how we're gonna do it.</i>

1104
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:02,720
<i>I grab poor Dallas's car phone and make
the most important call of my life.</i>

1105
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:07,600
<i>First, we gotta rescue Gail,
then comes the kill.</i>

1106
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:11,480
<i>The big, fat kill.</i>

1107
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,120
Do we just gotta stand here
and watch this?

1108
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,240
What, are you kidding me, man?

1109
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,640
I could watch old Manute do his thing
all night long and not get tired of it.

1110
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,120
I mean, the man's an artist.

1111
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:36,120
Only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject.

1112
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,040
Your skin is perfect.

1113
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,040
Your nerves, responsive.

1114
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,360
Beautiful.

1115
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,400
Just give them what they want, Gail.

1116
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,200
- Becky?
- It's over, Gail.

1117
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,520
There's no fighting them.
Dwight's dead.

1118
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,680
They got what's left of that cop we killed.

1119
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,640
The mob's gonna turn it over to the police
chief, the cops are gonna mow us down.

1120
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,560
We gotta cut a deal.

1121
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:07,080
You little bitch!
You sold us out!

1122
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:10,080
I didn't have no choice!
They was gonna hurt my mom.

1123
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,240
You gotta cut a deal with these people.

1124
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,360
It's selfish, you holding out like this.

1125
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,960
You're gonna get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason.

1126
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,400
It wasn't your mom!

1127
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:22,520
We could have protected her
and you know it.

1128
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,160
It was the money, you stupid little bitch!

1129
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:29,000
Sure, there's money. Sure, you could've
moved my mom into Old Town

1130
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,720
and let her know
that her daughter's a goddamn whore.

1131
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,840
Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

1132
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,480
They offered me what you couldn't
never offer me - a way out.

1133
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,360
I had to watch out for my own neck.

1134
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,040
Your neck.

1135
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:46,080
Your precious, scrawny, little neck!

1136
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:53,920
You're crazy! You could have
ripped my throat out, you crazy whore!

1137
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,760
Schutz, fetch my blades.

1138
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:02,720
- Stuka, kill this one.
- No, I was promised!

1139
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,440
Stupid little bitch!
You deserve worse!

1140
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,920
I knew there was a reason
I got out of bed this morning.

1141
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,320
Nobody.
I don't see nobody.

1142
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,920
Will you look at that?
It's right through me. Guys, look.

1143
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,800
There's something wrapped around it.

1144
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,520
Some kind of note.

1145
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,720
Give it to me.

1146
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,560
It's poked right through me.
Guys, look.

1147
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,560
- It's starting to really hurt.
- Out back. Everyone.

1148
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,360
And bring the women.

1149
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,560
Do you think somebody
should call me a doctor or something?

1150
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,160
McCarthy, you fool.

1151
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,240
Guys?

1152
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:57,600
<i>Dozens of them, armed to the teeth.</i>

1153
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:01,480
<i>I'm outnumbered, outgunned.</i>

1154
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:06,960
<i>But the alley is crooked,
dark and very narrow.</i>

1155
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,560
<i>They can't surround me.</i>

1156
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:14,560
<i>Sometimes, you can beat the odds
with the careful choice of where to fight.</i>

1157
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,080
You can have Old Town, I don't care.

1158
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,640
Just give me the woman.

1159
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,600
Shut up.

1160
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,520
Dwight, don't do this.

1161
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,760
- Hey, wait a minute. Something's not right.
- Shut up, or I'll plug you!

1162
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:38,200
Of course, Mr. McCarthy.
A fair trade.

1163
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,000
She's all yours.

1164
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:53,160
Now, if you'll explain to me why
we shouldn't blow both of you to pieces...

1165
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:56,880
Dwight, what have you done?

1166
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,920
Exactly what I had to.

1167
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,680
Every step of the way.

1168
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:08,000
No! It isn't right!
There wasn't no tape over his mouth!

1169
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,400
How come there's tape over his mouth?

1170
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,440
<i>Where to fight counts for a lot.</i>

1171
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:29,080
Cute trick, McCarthy,
but it will do you no good.

1172
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:33,000
<i>But there's nothing like having
your friends show up with lots of guns.</i>

1173
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,840
No!
McCarthy, you shit!

1174
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,960
<i>The girls all know the score.</i>

1175
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:47,360
<i>No escape, no surrender, no mercy.</i>

1176
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:51,200
<i>We gotta kill every last
rat bastard one of 'em.</i>

1177
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,360
<i>Every last one.</i>

1178
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:57,480
<i>Not for revenge,
not because they deserve it,</i>

1179
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:00,640
<i>not because it'll make
the world a better place.</i>

1180
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,480
<i>We need a heap of bloody bodies</i>

1181
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:07,440
<i>so when mob boss Wallenquist
looks over his charts of profits and losses,</i>

1182
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:11,640
<i>he'll see what it cost him
to mess with the girls of Old Town.</i>

1183
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,760
<i>The Valkyrie at my side
is shouting and laughing</i>

1184
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:20,000
<i>with the pure, hateful,
bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter,</i>

1185
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,320
<i>and so am I.</i>

1186
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,000
<i>The fire, baby.</i>

1187
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:31,760
<i>It'll burn us both.</i>

1188
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:35,600
<i>There's no place in this world
for our kind of fire,</i>

1189
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:39,880
<i>my warrior woman, my Valkyrie.</i>

1190
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,720
<i>You'll always be mine.</i>

1191
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,880
<i>Always...</i>

1192
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:46,560
<i>and never.</i>

1193
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,440
Evenin', officer.

1194
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:07,360
I don't have to introduce myself, do I?
You read the papers.

1195
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:10,760
This being an election year,
you've seen plenty of my picture.

1196
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:14,280
You know who I am and what I can do.

1197
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,000
And I'm doin' you, Hartigan.

1198
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,640
Cold and hard, I'm doing you.

1199
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,920
You blew my son's ear off.

1200
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:28,280
You blew his arm off.
You even blew his nuts and his pecker off.

1201
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:33,960
He's in a coma right now.
They say he may never come out of it.

1202
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,840
My boy.

1203
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,560
He could've been the first Roark to become
the President of the United States,

1204
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:42,680
but you went and turned him into
a brain-damaged, dickless freak.

1205
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:46,440
Pullin' that trigger make you feel powerful?

1206
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:51,240
Power don't come from a badge or a gun.

1207
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,640
Power comes from lying.

1208
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:59,320
Lying big, and gettin' the whole
damn world to play along with you.

1209
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,280
Once you got everybody agreeing with
what they know in their hearts ain't true,

1210
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,840
you've got 'em by the balls.

1211
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:10,200
There's what,
maybe 500 people in this hospital?

1212
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:16,120
I could pump you full of bullets right now,
and I wouldn't even be arrested.

1213
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:19,440
Everyone would lie for me -
everyone who counts.

1214
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,240
Otherwise, all their own lies -
everything that runs Sin City -

1215
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:26,120
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards.

1216
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,760
But I want you firm and fit and healthy.

1217
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,760
I'm even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery.

1218
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,920
Fix that heart condition of yours.

1219
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:44,200
You're gonna keep on living a long time.
I'm gonna make sure of that.

1220
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:50,600
You're gonna be convicted of raping
that little brat, and shooting my boy.

1221
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,960
And you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison,

1222
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:56,680
disgraced, destroyed...

1223
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,680
alone.

1224
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,440
Your wife?

1225
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,680
You tell her the truth and she's dead.

1226
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,680
You tell anybody the truth
and they're dead.

1227
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,240
They won't let me testify.

1228
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:14,480
I told the cops that you saved my life
and they just acted like I was crazy.

1229
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,280
They talked my parents
into keeping me away.

1230
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,800
They said that you'd done things
that you didn't do.

1231
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,240
I told them that you saved me
from that Roark creep,

1232
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:26,320
but they won't even check me out
to see that I'm still a virgin.

1233
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:30,800
I'm still a virgin, still alive -
thanks to you.

1234
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,040
They got it all backwards.

1235
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:36,640
Sometimes, the truth
doesn't matter like it ought.

1236
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:40,160
But you'll always remember things right.

1237
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:42,240
That's gonna mean a lot to me.

1238
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:48,640
But stay away, Nancy.
They'll kill you if you don't stay away.

1239
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:50,680
Don't visit me.

1240
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,480
Don't write me.

1241
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,600
Don't even say my name.

1242
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:59,000
Maybe you won't let me visit,
but I'll still write to you, Hartigan.

1243
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,960
I'll sign my letters "Cordelia. "

1244
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:05,360
That's the name of a really cool
detective in books I read.

1245
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:09,640
I'll write you every week... for forever.

1246
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:12,400
Sure, kid.

1247
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,520
Now, run on home.

1248
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,880
It's not safe for you here.

1249
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,360
Bye, Nancy.

1250
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,840
I love you.

1251
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,760
John Hartigan.

1252
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,520
Mr. Law and Order.

1253
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,880
Mr. By the Book.

1254
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,040
Mr. High and Mighty.

1255
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:52,560
I gotta give you credit, being such
a straight arrow for so damn many years

1256
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,720
without it catching up with you.

1257
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,920
It's catching up with you now,
friend of mine.

1258
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,160
It's catching up with you but good.

1259
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,760
Maybe I oughta look at him.
He doesn't look too good.

1260
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:12,960
He's hale and hearty, Tammy. See?

1261
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:16,240
He's the picture of health.

1262
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:19,600
That Tammy, there - she's fine, isn't she?

1263
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,840
I rented her out of Old Town.

1264
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:26,400
I wanted to show you what you won't
be getting any of, not in prison.

1265
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,800
You hear me, Hartigan?

1266
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,400
If you stop being stupid,
start playing along with us,

1267
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,200
you might just get some of Tammy.

1268
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:37,800
You see that?
She flinched.

1269
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,160
You make her sick.

1270
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,880
She heard about you and that little girl.

1271
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:47,120
<i>This is nothing but a price I promised
myself I'd pay, and I'm paying it.</i>

1272
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:51,440
<i>You don't save a little girl's life, then
turn around and throw her to the dogs.</i>

1273
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,400
<i>Not in my book, you don't.</i>

1274
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:56,800
<i>They want a confession.
They won't get it.</i>

1275
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:03,520
<i>There was a letter from Nancy waiting
when they put me in solitary.</i>

1276
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,520
<i>She calls herself "Cordelia,"
just like she promised.</i>

1277
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:10,240
<i>She makes no mention of anything
that would give her away.</i>

1278
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,160
<i>At first, I figure
she'll send another note or two</i>

1279
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:16,360
<i>before her young mind
moves on to better things.</i>

1280
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:19,560
<i>But every Thursday, another one arrives.</i>

1281
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,400
<i>What a sweet kid.</i>

1282
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,680
<i>I do my best to keep my hand
from shaking when I reach for it.</i>

1283
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:29,960
<i>She's the only friend I've got -
the daughter I never had.</i>

1284
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,000
<i>My sweet Cordelia.</i>

1285
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,560
<i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan.</i>

1286
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,680
<i>Eight years pass.</i>

1287
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,760
<i>Then comes a Thursday
when I bound from my cot,</i>

1288
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,760
<i>excited as a kid at Christmas,</i>

1289
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,320
<i>only to find myself
staring at the damn floor of my damn cell,</i>

1290
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,400
<i>looking for a letter from Nancy
that isn't there.</i>

1291
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,320
<i>Then another Thursday with no letter.</i>

1292
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,200
<i>Is she all right?</i>

1293
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,600
<i>Did something happen to her?</i>

1294
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:04,040
<i>Nothing.</i>

1295
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:07,680
<i>Two months now -
not a word from Nancy.</i>

1296
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,040
<i>Did they find her?
Did they get to her?</i>

1297
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:14,440
<i>Of course!
Stupid old man.</i>

1298
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:17,960
<i>Do your math.
Nancy's 19 years old.</i>

1299
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:20,440
<i>How long did you expect her
to keep writing?</i>

1300
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:24,080
<i>She was a saint to keep it up
as long as she did.</i>

1301
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:27,080
<i>She's forgotten you, old man.</i>

1302
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,080
<i>You're alone.</i>

1303
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,480
<i>You're all alone.</i>

1304
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:42,360
<i>This guy smells awful -
like bad food.</i>

1305
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:45,720
<i>Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster
in the middle of summer.</i>

1306
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,840
<i>He stinks so bad, I want to throw up.</i>

1307
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:01,280
<i>Practically knocked my head off,
the bastard.</i>

1308
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,080
<i>When I come to, I see it.</i>

1309
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:07,280
<i>The same kind of envelope
Nancy always uses,</i>

1310
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,680
<i>but there's no letter inside of it.</i>

1311
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,720
<i>There's something soft,</i>

1312
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:15,560
<i>something that ought to be alive -
a hunk of meat and bone</i>

1313
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:19,520
<i>that ought to be the index finger
of the right hand of a 19-year-old girl.</i>

1314
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,640
<i>How the hell did they find her?</i>

1315
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,440
<i>She was so careful.</i>

1316
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,280
<i>She never gave away
where she lives or where she works.</i>

1317
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:34,480
<i>I've got to get out.
I've got to help her.</i>

1318
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:39,440
<i>Nothing else matters -
not my life and not my pride, either.</i>

1319
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,000
<i>It's only one final surrender they want.</i>

1320
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:45,640
<i>You got me, Roark.
You beat me.</i>

1321
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:49,680
<i>I say everything they want to hear,
just the way they want to hear it.</i>

1322
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,080
<i>I tell them I'm a twisted,
wretched child molester.</i>

1323
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:56,400
<i>I agree to everything they want from me.</i>

1324
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,440
<i>I love you, Nancy.</i>

1325
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:12,320
It's a lot of miles into town, Hartigan.

1326
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:19,280
- You care for a ride?
- Long as you stay in front of me.

1327
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,080
Prison's made you paranoid.
Talk about water under the bridge.

1328
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,560
Christ.

1329
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:28,360
Eight years.

1330
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,760
Well, if it's any consolation to you...

1331
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:39,600
you made me hate myself.

1332
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,120
Any word from Eileen?

1333
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:49,200
She got remarried four years ago.

1334
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:55,400
She had two kids.
I'm sorry, John.

1335
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,440
Don't be.

1336
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,880
I'm glad.

1337
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:03,040
Eileen always wanted kids.

1338
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,960
She'll make a good mother.

1339
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:11,000
Like you said, Bob -
water under the bridge.

1340
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:24,640
<i>Bob and I get on
with our fond farewells to each other,</i>

1341
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:28,720
<i>then I go looking for the only human being
on the planet who means a damn to me -</i>

1342
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,160
<i>Nancy.</i>

1343
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:33,520
<i>How could they have found out it was you
writing all those letters to me?</i>

1344
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,240
<i>How did they find out who you are?</i>

1345
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:39,360
<i>And what have they done to you, baby?</i>

1346
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:45,000
<i>Not a sound.</i>

1347
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:47,680
<i>No sign of life.</i>

1348
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:51,320
<i>Has Roark gone to all this trouble
just to torture a broken old man,</i>

1349
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:55,000
<i>like a kid poking at a fly
when he's already torn his wings off?</i>

1350
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,760
<i>What has he done to Nancy?</i>

1351
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:00,480
<i>It's like all she ever does
is read and study and write.</i>

1352
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:05,640
<i>No diary, no phone numbers
or addresses written down anywhere.</i>

1353
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:10,440
<i>Closest thing to a clue
is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon.</i>

1354
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:15,560
<i>It's a long shot,
but maybe she's got some friends there.</i>

1355
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,000
<i>A dead end.</i>

1356
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:27,680
<i>Nancy wouldn't have anything to do
with a pack of drunks and losers like this.</i>

1357
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:31,480
<i>But if there's anything to be found here,
the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is</i>

1358
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,480
<i>or whoever kidnapped her
and mutilated her, this is the place.</i>

1359
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:39,400
Excuse me, miss. Wondering if you
could help me. I'm looking for somebody.

1360
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:42,680
Cold night like this, everybody's
looking for somebody, stranger.

1361
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:45,520
It's not like that.
Her name is Nancy.

1362
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,960
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim.

1363
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:51,160
She's just warming up.

1364
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,680
<i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan.</i>

1365
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,560
<i>She grew up.</i>

1366
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:06,440
<i>She filled out.</i>

1367
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:10,000
<i>Nancy Callahan, 19 years old.</i>

1368
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:14,800
<i>And here I was,
expecting a skinny little bookworm,</i>

1369
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:18,520
<i>maybe a bit too shy for her own good.</i>

1370
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:24,240
<i>How little she told me about herself
in all her letters for all those years.</i>

1371
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:30,520
<i>How the hell did they find her?</i>

1372
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,040
<i>Then it hits me.</i>

1373
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,240
<i>They were bluffing.</i>

1374
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,880
<i>I've led them straight to her.</i>

1375
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,680
<i>She hasn't spotted you yet.</i>

1376
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:52,200
<i>Turn around and walk out the door.</i>

1377
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,920
<i>Lead the creep outside.</i>

1378
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:00,000
<i>Get that Beretta away from him somehow,
and kill him.</i>

1379
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:03,880
<i>I'm just a horny ex-con
watching an exotic dancer.</i>

1380
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:06,800
<i>Just a few seconds and she'll be safe.</i>

1381
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:10,160
<i>No, Nancy.
Don't notice me.</i>

1382
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:13,480
<i>Don't recognize me.</i>

1383
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:24,760
There's no time to explain.

1384
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,680
I've made a terrible mistake,
put you in terrible danger.

1385
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:30,040
We need to get out of here
right this second.

1386
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:33,840
Whatever you say, Hartigan.
Let me throw some clothes on.

1387
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:40,480
And here I'd figured you'd forgotten
all about me. Me and my dumb letters.

1388
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,840
Kept me going.

1389
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,280
Kept me from killing myself.

1390
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,840
Hurry up, will you?

1391
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:58,000
- Maybe I should drive.
- Not a chance.

1392
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:01,440
Nobody but me
can keep this heap running.

1393
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,520
Besides, from the sound of things,
you might have to shoot somebody.

1394
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:13,480
- I don't have a gun.
- Under the seat.

1395
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:16,800
It's loaded and it works.

1396
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,240
Yeah, this'll do.

1397
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,680
Taken it to the range a couple of times.
Kicks like a mule.

1398
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:33,680
Hartigan, there's so much
I've wanted to say to you.

1399
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,200
You've never been far from my thoughts.

1400
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:39,760
I've lain awake nights, thinking of you.

1401
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:42,520
What are you talking about?

1402
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:47,200
Keep driving, Nancy.
Keep driving and keep the car on the road!

1403
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,720
<i>She's counting on you, old man.</i>

1404
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,480
What are you doing?

1405
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,880
<i>Prove you're still worth a damn.</i>

1406
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,160
Try and keep it on the road, Nancy!

1407
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:08,440
<i>He's a decent shot.</i>

1408
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:11,320
<i>He's got skill,
but he's in too much of a hurry.</i>

1409
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,240
<i>Throwing away bullets
like they were candy.</i>

1410
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,080
<i>He doesn't know how to take his time.</i>

1411
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:23,320
<i>Aim careful and look the devil in the eye.</i>

1412
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,800
Stop the car, Nancy.
Gotta confirm the kill.

1413
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:35,880
- What?
- Stop the car, now!

1414
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,880
Right.
Stop the car, confirm the kill.

1415
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,040
Sorry. I got a little rattled.

1416
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:52,200
It's OK. You did great.
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

1417
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,360
No!
Let me stay close.

1418
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,840
Nothing can happen to me
when I'm with you.

1419
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:00,000
Please?
Let me stay close.

1420
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:12,880
<i>The stink - I almost gag.</i>

1421
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:14,800
<i>His blood smells
even worse than he does.</i>

1422
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:17,720
<i>- Jesus.
- And it's all over the place.</i>

1423
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:22,080
<i>But the creep himself, he's gone.</i>

1424
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:24,160
We're out of time.

1425
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:28,480
<i>The sirens - I used to welcome the sound.</i>

1426
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,800
<i>There's nothing to do now
but find a place to hole up for the night,</i>

1427
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:35,440
<i>get Nancy calmed down, and figure out
what on Earth I'm going to do next.</i>

1428
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:38,920
<i>The stink - somehow it stays with us
all the way to the motel.</i>

1429
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:41,600
Nancy, I went to your apartment.

1430
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:45,480
Your window was thrown wide open.
The rooms looked almost empty.

1431
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,720
That's why I was sure
you'd been kidnapped.

1432
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:51,400
My window? Robbed again?
That's the third time this year!

1433
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:54,920
I swore if I ever saw you again,
I'd show you I grew up strong.

1434
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,480
But there I was, just like before,
scared and helpless.

1435
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:01,040
- I'm such an asshole.
- You should sit down.

1436
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:05,040
You'll feel a little bit better if you sit down.

1437
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,880
<i>I've never been all that good with people.</i>

1438
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:11,200
<i>When it comes to reassuring
a traumatized 19-year-old,</i>

1439
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:15,040
<i>I'm as expert as a palsy victim
doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench.</i>

1440
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:17,880
It's always been you, Hartigan.

1441
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:19,840
All these years.

1442
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:23,440
It's just nerves
making you say that, Nancy.

1443
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,560
You're just exhausted.
You need to sleep.

1444
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:29,720
- Sleep with me.
- Stop it, Nancy!

1445
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:32,120
Eight years.

1446
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:35,720
Why do you think
I kept writing you those letters?

1447
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,880
It wasn't just gratitude.

1448
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:40,960
I tried to fall in love with boys.

1449
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,280
Even thought I did once or twice.

1450
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:47,200
But I was already in love... with you.

1451
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,880
That's enough.
Jesus Christ!

1452
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,200
I'm old enough to be your grandfather!

1453
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:54,840
- You're just scared.
- I'm not scared.

1454
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,200
No.

1455
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:34,000
There's wrong and there's wrong
and then there's this.

1456
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,520
For God's sakes, you're just a kid!

1457
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,400
I love you.

1458
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,200
I love you, too.

1459
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:48,080
With all my heart.

1460
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:52,400
<i>Cold shower- it helps.</i>

1461
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,680
No, Nancy.

1462
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:59,240
Recognize my voice, Hartigan?

1463
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:03,000
Recognize my voice,
you piece of shit cop?

1464
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:06,720
I look different,
but I bet you can recognize my voice.

1465
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:10,640
Sure.
I recognize your voice, Junior.

1466
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,000
<i>Everything's gone straight to hell.</i>

1467
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:18,400
<i>I've been suckered
into betraying the only friend I've got,</i>

1468
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:22,000
<i>and put her in the hands of a murdering
rapist I thought I'd put down for good.</i>

1469
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:26,120
<i>Suckered by a spoiled brat
son of a senator.</i>

1470
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,120
<i>It's all gone to hell.</i>

1471
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:30,080
Klump, it's me.

1472
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,880
I got a dead man needs to be fetched.

1473
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,840
I want you to set me up for a party.

1474
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:37,280
I've already got the girl, you dumb shit!

1475
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,120
Hey, it better be perfect
or I'm calling my dad!

1476
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:42,560
My tools better be clean and sharp.

1477
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,320
It better be ready!
It better be perfect!

1478
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:52,440
I get to do whatever I want,
however I want, whenever I want it!

1479
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:56,120
My dad - I'd love him if I didn't hate him.

1480
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:58,840
He spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the planet

1481
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,920
to grow back that equipment
you blew off from between my legs,

1482
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,200
just so the old fart can hold out
some kind of hope of having a grandkid.

1483
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:10,120
Although, as you can see,
there were some side effects.

1484
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:12,280
I'm not complaining, though.
Since you've been gone,

1485
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:14,080
I've been having the time of my life.

1486
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:17,520
And now you've led me back
to your darling Cordelia.

1487
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,640
We all wondered
who wrote all those letters.

1488
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,600
She left not a clue.

1489
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:26,040
Clever girl.
And so pretty, so pretty.

1490
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:32,440
A little old for my taste,
but I can forgive that just this once.

1491
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,600
Nancy, don't scream.

1492
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:37,960
Whatever he does to you, don't scream.

1493
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:42,160
She'll scream. I'm gonna take
all night doing dear old Nancy.

1494
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:45,440
And you're gonna die knowing
that it's all your fault.

1495
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:48,080
They've all screamed, Hartigan.

1496
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,880
Dozens of them - maybe a hundred.

1497
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:54,000
Eight years' worth.
Every one of them has screamed.

1498
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:56,240
And if there weren't
so many people hereabout,

1499
01:42:56,280 --> 01:43:00,120
I would show you how
I'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream.

1500
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,760
It's gonna be one hell of a show!

1501
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:14,960
<i>This is it.
No way to fight it now.</i>

1502
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,960
<i>No hope left.</i>

1503
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:18,720
<i>No chance.</i>

1504
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:22,480
<i>This is it.
This is the end.</i>

1505
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:26,200
<i>No.</i>

1506
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,880
<i>Give it a shot, old man.
Keep your neck tight. Move.</i>

1507
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:34,640
<i>The window - maybe there's an alarm.</i>

1508
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:37,280
<i>Keep your neck tight, goddamn it!
Stay conscious!</i>

1509
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:40,040
<i>Stay conscious.</i>

1510
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,240
<i>No alarm.</i>

1511
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:44,000
<i>The glass! Cut the rope.</i>

1512
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,760
<i>You can do it.</i>

1513
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,440
It is inclement upon me

1514
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:52,680
to comment with marked displeasure
on your rash impulsiveness

1515
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:59,240
in selecting such an eye-catching
and impractical car to heist, Mr. Shlubb.

1516
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:04,760
Irrelevant to said mission is the following
query, which I now put forth to you.

1517
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:10,760
Wherein this most streamlined
and trunkless of transports -

1518
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:13,280
boner-inspiring though it may be -

1519
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:18,040
wherein are we to reposit
our recently deceased cargo?

1520
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:24,600
I can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm.

1521
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:32,480
Tell me where Roark takes the girls
or I'll cut your damn head off!

1522
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:34,160
In plain English, creep!

1523
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:37,840
The answer you seek is rural,
even agrarian.

1524
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:41,120
The farm!

1525
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:44,800
<i>That's all I need to hear.
Every cop on the force</i>

1526
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:48,800
<i>knows about the Roark family's farm
and to stay away from it.</i>

1527
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:51,080
<i>Shlubb and Klump
were packing an arsenal.</i>

1528
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,160
<i>Once things get loud,
I'll probably have use for the cannons.</i>

1529
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:57,080
<i>But at first, I'll have to play it quiet.</i>

1530
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:59,280
<i>Quiet and nasty.</i>

1531
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:03,080
<i>Nancy's car- six miles from the farm.</i>

1532
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:06,280
<i>"Nobody but me can keep
this heap running, " she told me.</i>

1533
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:09,680
<i>Good girl.
The car stalled out on that yellow bastard</i>

1534
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:12,040
<i>and you didn't tell him
how to start it up again.</i>

1535
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:15,840
<i>You kept your mouth shut.
I'll bet Junior was furious.</i>

1536
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:18,440
<i>I'll bet he slapped you around
something fierce.</i>

1537
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:22,320
<i>But you stayed strong.
You bought a few extra minutes.</i>

1538
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:24,520
<i>There's still a chance, Nancy.</i>

1539
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:26,480
<i>Don't scream.</i>

1540
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,920
<i>I ditch the car a mile or so from the farm
and make my way through the woods.</i>

1541
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:34,800
<i>I'm not halfway there when it hits.</i>

1542
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:39,200
<i>My heart.
Can't be my heart.</i>

1543
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,960
<i>I was cured.</i>

1544
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,920
<i>Bad cough - blood in it.</i>

1545
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:46,960
<i>Doesn't matter now.</i>

1546
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:50,080
<i>I don't have to stay alive
that much longer, anyway.</i>

1547
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,960
<i>Rotten way to kill a man, but it's quiet.</i>

1548
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:05,600
<i>Hate yourself later.</i>

1549
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:19,680
You're only making this worse for yourself,
you stupid cow!

1550
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:30,680
Do you think I'm tired?

1551
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,800
Is that it?
Do you think I'm getting tired?

1552
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,200
You're the one who's gonna crack!

1553
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:37,160
You'll crack!

1554
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:40,120
You'll cry and beg!

1555
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:41,920
You'll scream!

1556
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:46,520
Oh, yeah, you'll scream,
you big, fat, ugly cow!

1557
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,840
You're thinking the whip
was the worst I could do?

1558
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,800
That was foreplay.

1559
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,640
Hartigan was right about you.

1560
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:05,080
You can't get it up unless I scream.

1561
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:08,360
You're pathetic!

1562
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:11,640
You're pathetic.

1563
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:16,880
It's not wise at all
to make fun of me like that.

1564
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,680
It brings out the worst in me.

1565
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:28,640
<i>Stupid old man!</i>

1566
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:30,760
<i>In too much of a hurry.</i>

1567
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:35,160
Damn!
It can't be!

1568
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:39,000
<i>Charging in like Galahad,
just like I told myself I wouldn't!</i>

1569
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:40,320
<i>Stupid old man!</i>

1570
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:44,400
- You tagged him good!
- Don't take no chances. Perforate the fool.

1571
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:50,720
Good advice.

1572
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,680
Give it up, Junior.

1573
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:04,640
It's over.
Let her go.

1574
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:06,400
You're dreaming, Hartigan!

1575
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:11,240
I get to see your eyes while I fillet the
woman of your dreams right in front of you!

1576
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:14,360
Look at you!
You're about to keel over!

1577
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:17,080
You can't even lift that cannon!

1578
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:19,400
Sure, I can.

1579
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,600
You gave me a scare there
for a second there, old man.

1580
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:31,480
Nancy, I'm sorry.

1581
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:34,800
I'm taking no chances with you.

1582
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:40,600
First I soften you up,
and then it's showtime.

1583
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:46,040
Here it comes.

1584
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:49,320
It's gonna hurt.

1585
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:51,320
You're right about that.

1586
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:56,880
Sucker.

1587
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:01,760
<i>I take away his weapon.</i>

1588
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:04,920
<i>Both of them.</i>

1589
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:19,800
Eight long years, son of a bitch!

1590
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:24,600
<i>After a while, all I'm doing is pounding
wet chunks of bone into the floorboards,</i>

1591
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:25,840
<i>so I stop.</i>

1592
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:29,680
So long, Junior.

1593
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:32,200
Been a pleasure.

1594
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:40,720
I didn't scream, Hartigan, not once.

1595
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,600
I didn't scream.

1596
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:45,720
I know it, baby.

1597
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,080
You grew up strong.

1598
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:02,280
<i>By the time I get her to the car,
Nancy stops shaking.</i>

1599
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:06,120
<i>Her skin is warm again.
She's herself again.</i>

1600
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:08,560
Thanks for remembering my coat.

1601
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,800
And for all the little things.

1602
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:15,840
Like saving my life, twice.

1603
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,720
- You better get rolling.
- You're not coming along?

1604
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:24,560
No. I have friends on their way,
to collect evidence.

1605
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:27,280
I'm gonna blow
this whole sick mess wide open.

1606
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:29,560
I'm gonna clear my name.

1607
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:33,520
I'm gonna put Senator Roark
behind bars where he belongs.

1608
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:37,080
I can't lose you, not again.

1609
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,240
You'll never lose me, Nancy.

1610
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:58,080
<i>Nancy Callahan, the love of my life.</i>

1611
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:03,720
<i>Shame to lie to her.
I hope she forgives me for it.</i>

1612
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:07,240
<i>Get Senator Roark behind bars?
Sure.</i>

1613
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:10,720
<i>And maybe after I've pulled off
that miracle, I'll go and punch out God.</i>

1614
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:14,480
<i>There isn't a prosecutor in the state
who'll go after Senator Roark.</i>

1615
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:16,520
<i>I killed his only son.</i>

1616
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:18,640
<i>The bloodline is cut.</i>

1617
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:21,440
<i>Roark's lost his goddamn legacy.</i>

1618
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:24,200
<i>He'll use all his power
to get revenge on me.</i>

1619
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:27,720
<i>He'll go after me through Nancy.
He'll find her again.</i>

1620
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:30,200
<i>There'll be no end to it.</i>

1621
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:32,360
<i>She'll never be safe.</i>

1622
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:34,960
<i>Not as long as I'm alive.</i>

1623
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:37,520
<i>There's only one way to beat him.</i>

1624
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:40,680
<i>An old man dies,</i>

1625
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,880
<i>a young woman lives.</i>

1626
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:46,120
<i>Fair trade.</i>

1627
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,800
<i>I love you, Nancy.</i>

1628
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,440
Yes.

1629
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,800
Oh, Mom, don't go on like that.

1630
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:07,840
It's not the city. I could've gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere.

1631
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:11,320
Yeah, just a fracture.
The doctor said it's a clean break.

1632
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:13,640
It should be right as rain in no time.

1633
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:35,320
<i>Turn the right corner in Sin City</i>

1634
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:39,720
<i>and you can find anything.</i>

1635
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,400
Becky.

1636
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,920
Care for a smoke?

1637
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:50,000
Love you, too, Mom.

1638
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:53,160
<i>Anything.</i>
