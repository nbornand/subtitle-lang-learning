LOS ANGELES 2029 A.D.

3
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,711
THE MACHINES ROSE FROM THE
ASHES OF THE NUCLEAR FIRE.

4
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,389
THEIR WAR TO EXTERMINATE MANKIND
HAS RAGED FOR DECADES,

5
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,876
BUT THE FINAL BATTLE WOULD NOT
BE FOUGHT IN THE FUTURE.

6
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,560
IT WOULD BE FOUGHT HERE,
IN OUR PRESENT.

7
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,636
TONIGHT...

8
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,552
LOS ANGELES 1984
1:52 AM.

9
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,268
What the hell...?
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...

10
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,070
What the hell...?

11
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,116
Hey, my turn.

12
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,589
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

13
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,196
Nice night for a walk?

14
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,030
Nice night for a walk.

15
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,994
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

16
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,872
Nothing clean. Right.

17
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,958
I think this guy's a couple of cans
short of a six-pack.

18
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,152
Your clothes, give them to me.

19
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,078
- Now.
- Fuck you, asshole.

20
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,479
Hey, buddy, did you just see
a real bright light?

21
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,560
- See that guy?
- Hold it right there.

22
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,070
- He's rabbiting.
- Hey! I said hold it! Go.

23
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,078
That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.

24
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,152
- What day is it? The date.
- 12th May.

25
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,113
- Thursday.
- What year?

26
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,758
He's got my gun. Let's go.

27
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,069
Guard it for me, Big Buns.

28
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,476
Hi. I'm late.

29
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,436
So am I.

30
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,476
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

31
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,589
- Honey, can I have that coffee now?
- Yes, sir.

32
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,359
- OK. Who gets the burly-beef?
- I ordered barbecued.

33
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,471
That's mine, but I didn't order fries.

34
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,797
- Mine's the chili beef deluxe.
- Who gets the burly-beef?

35
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,673
- We're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

36
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,076
I'm so sorry.

37
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,996
This isn't real leather, is it?

38
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,111
Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.

39
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,749
Look at it this way.
In 100 years, who's gonna care?

40
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,155
The 12-gauge auto-loader.

41
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,959
That's Italian. You can go pump or auto.

42
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,393
The 45 long slide with laser sighting.

43
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,830
These are new. We just got them in.
That's a good gun.

44
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,035
The beam comes on - you put the red dot
where you want the bullet to go.

45
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,116
You can't miss.

46
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,433
- Anything else?
- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.

47
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,120
Hey, just what you see, pal.

48
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,754
The Uzi nine millimeter.

49
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,235
You know your weapons, buddy.

50
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,511
Any one of these is ideal
for home defense.

51
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,438
So which will it be?

52
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,996
- All.
- I may close early today.

53
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,238
It's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take now.

54
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,271
- You can't do that.
- Wrong.

55
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,753
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

56
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,919
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.

57
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,191
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...?

58
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,952
Hey, man, you got
a serious attitude problem.

59
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,115
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

60
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,714
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

61
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,389
Sarah, come here. It's about you.
I mean, sort of.

62
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,797
Incredible. You're not gonna believe this.
You're going to love this.

63
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,632
<i>- What?
...compiled from several witnesses.</i>

64
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,911
<i>Once again, Sarah Connor,
35, mother of two,</i>

65
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,349
<i>brutally shot to death this afternoon.</i>

66
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,630
You're dead, honey.

67
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,636
<i>...if you're into sound,</i>

68
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,912
<i>for the greatest sound around,
come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.</i>

69
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,999
<i>We've got woofers, tweeters,
the newest in audio and compact discs.</i>

70
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,351
<i>We've got graphic equalizers
and sound balancers that...</i>

71
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,478
Sorry.

72
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,558
Hello?

73
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,719
<i>First I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse one by one,</i>

74
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,992
<i>then run my tongue down your neck
to your bare, gleaming breasts.</i>

75
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,274
<i>And then slowly... slowly pull
your jeans off inch by inch.</i>

76
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,478
Ginger, it's Matt.

77
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,559
And lick your belly in circles
further and further down,

78
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,797
and then pull your panties off
with my teeth.

79
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,309
Who is this?

80
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,510
God. Sarah?

81
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,468
<i>Jesus. I'm sorry.</i>

82
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,114
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger?

83
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,639
Sure.

84
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,116
It's the creep.

85
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,355
Hello?

86
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,836
First I'll rip the buttons off
your blouse one by one...

87
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,469
You fucking pigs. Wait till I get
my hands on you. Get off me.

88
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,276
Ed.

89
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,596
- What have you got?
- Dead girl.

90
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,190
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.

91
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,869
Shot six times at less than 10 feet.
Large caliber weapon.

92
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,956
You know, these work.

93
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,754
- What's this?
- Dead girl two.

94
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,031
Sent over from the Valley division
this afternoon.

95
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,833
Are you sure there's a point to all of this?

96
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,235
Look at the name, Ed.

97
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,909
Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?

98
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,789
You're kidding.

99
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,434
The press is gonna be short-stroking it.

100
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,758
- A one-day pattern killer.
- I hate the weird ones.

101
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,916
So...

102
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,634
Better than mortal man deserves.

103
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,632
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- Not lately. Did you check messages?

104
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,035
I thought you did.

105
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,954
<i>- Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...
- There you are, young man.</i>

106
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,230
You mind your mother.

107
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,190
<i>Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.
Something's come up.</i>

108
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,915
<i>Looks like I won't be able to make it
tonight. Just can't get out of it.</i>

109
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,556
<i>I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you.
Call you in a day or so. Bye.</i>

110
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,198
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?

111
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,791
He can't treat you like this.
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.

112
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,876
I'll live.

113
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,150
I'll break his kneecaps.

114
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,469
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don't you, baby?

115
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,996
God. It's disgusting.

116
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,680
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Have a good time.

117
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,598
- We will. You, too.
- OK.

118
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,676
Damn it, Matt.

119
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,956
Shit.

120
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,039
These killings occurred in the order
of their listings in the phone book.

121
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,357
- What can I tell you? No comment.
- But, Lieutenant...

122
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,395
That coffee's two hours cold.

123
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,754
I put a cigarette out in it.

124
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,236
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I got her answering machine.

125
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,794
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit. There's no answer.

126
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,150
- The apartment manager's not in.
- Call her.

127
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,033
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

128
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,116
Give me a cigarette.

129
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,435
<i>Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.</i>

130
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,473
<i>But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too, so talk to it...</i>

131
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,996
Same shit.

132
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,555
I can hear it now. He's gonna be
called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.

133
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,674
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.

134
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,680
- Where are you going?
- To make a statement.

135
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,756
Maybe make these jackals work for us.

136
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,476
If I can get on the tube by eleven o'clock,
maybe she'll call us.

137
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,114
Well, how do I look?

138
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,437
- Like shit, boss.
- Your mama.

139
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,552
<i>This just in. Police have announced
the name of the victim</i>

140
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,036
<i>in the second of two murders
which took place today.</i>

141
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,392
<i>Incredibly, the names of the
two victims are virtually identical.</i>

142
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,469
<i>Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann
Connor was pronounced dead...</i>

143
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,750
<i>- Can we change this?
- Sarah Louise...</i>

144
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,269
Don't touch it.

145
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,638
<i>Police are refusing to speculate on the
similarity between the shooting deaths</i>

146
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,878
<i>and no other connection between
the two victims has been established yet.</i>

147
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,629
<i>We'll have more on this
late-breaking story as it comes in.</i>

148
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,790
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It's in the back.

149
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,275
Hey. Four-fifty.

150
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,991
<i>You have reached the Los Angeles
Police emergency number.</i>

151
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,671
<i>All lines are busy. If you need a police car
sent out to you, stay on the line.</i>

152
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,239
Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.

153
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,438
Don't make me bust you up, man.

154
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,915
<i>Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.</i>

155
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,873
<i>But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too.</i>

156
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,913
<i>So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,
or Sarah will get back to you.</i>

157
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,474
<i>Wait for the beep.</i>

158
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,830
<i>This is Sarah. Pick up if you're there.</i>

159
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,512
<i>I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard
called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.</i>

160
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,475
I think that there's somebody after me.
I hope that you play this back soon.

161
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,036
I need you and Matt to come
and pick me up as soon as possible.

162
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,391
The police keep transferring me.
I'm gonna give 'em another try.

163
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:26,550
<i>The number here is 5559175.
Call me, kiddo. I need your help.</i>

164
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,115
<i>It's her.</i>

165
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,590
Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.

166
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,917
Don't put me on hold.
Don't transfer me to another department.

167
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,190
I won't. Can you tell me where you are?

168
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,108
<i>- I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.
- I know it. It's on Pico.</i>

169
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,800
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.

170
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,879
- I think there's a guy following me.
- Now, listen carefully.

171
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,596
You're in a public place so you'll be safe.
Stay visible. Don't go outside.

172
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,678
<i>- I'll have a car there in a minute.
- OK.</i>

173
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,596
Hey, that guy didn't pay.

174
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,031
Come with me if you wanna live.

175
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,756
Come on!

176
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,114
This is one-L-19. I got a hit-and-run felony.

177
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,392
Suspect vehicle - late model
grey Ford headed westbound on Seven.

178
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,590
He's really moving - punching lights.

179
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,271
I'm gonna need an ambulance
at Seventh and Broadway right now.

180
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,550
Hold it.

181
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,395
Hold on.

182
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,519
Are you injured? Are you shot?

183
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,796
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

184
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,276
Don't move unless I say.
Don't make a sound unless I say.

185
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,595
Do you understand?

186
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,077
- Do you understand?
- Yes. Please don't hurt me.

187
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,312
I'm here to help you.

188
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,911
I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.
DN38416. Assigned to protect you.

189
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,270
You've been targeted for termination.

190
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,075
This is one-L-19. Westbound
on Olympic. Approaching Overland.

191
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,356
This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.

192
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,029
No, but you will.
It's very important that you live.

193
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,516
This isn't true. How could that man
just get up after you...

194
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,438
It's not a man. A machine.

195
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,916
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101.

196
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,599
A machine? Like a robot?

197
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,077
Not a robot. A cyborg -
cybernetic organism.

198
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,919
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

199
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,515
Get your head down.

200
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,036
Listen. The Terminator's an infiltration
unit. Part man, part machine.

201
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,872
Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat
chassis. Microprocessor controlled.

202
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,278
Fully armored, very tough.
Outside it's living human tissue.

203
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,552
Flesh, skin, hair, blood -
grown for the cyborgs.

204
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,399
- Look, Reese, I don't know...
- Pay attention.

205
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,875
I gotta ditch this car.

206
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,839
The 600-Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.

207
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,349
But these are new. They look human.

208
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,155
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

209
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,716
I had to wait till he moved on you
before I could zero him.

210
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:31,278
Look, I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.

211
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,154
Not yet. Not for about forty years.

212
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,630
Are you saying it's from the future?

213
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,309
One possible future...
from your point of view.

214
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,432
I don't know tech stuff.

215
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,199
Then you're from the future, too.
Is that right?

216
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,276
- Right.
- Right.

217
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:04,274
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I do. Don't do that again.

218
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,234
- Just let me go.
- Listen and understand.

219
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,715
That Terminator is out there.

220
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,549
It can't be bargained with,
it can't be reasoned with.

221
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,199
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear

222
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:26,031
and it absolutely will not stop,
ever, until you are dead.

223
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,473
Can you stop it?

224
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,556
I don't know.

225
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,875
With these weapons, I don't know.

226
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,958
<i>All units. Ford suspect vehicle has
been found in a parking structure...</i>

227
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,957
Reese, why me?

228
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,520
Why does it want me?

229
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,194
There was a nuclear war.

230
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,870
A few years from now,

231
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,313
all this, this whole place, everything,

232
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,831
it's gone, just gone.

233
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,556
There were survivors.

234
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,636
Here, there.

235
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,158
Nobody even knew who started it.

236
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,836
- It was the machines, Sarah.
- I don't understand.

237
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,394
Defense network computers.

238
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,078
New, powerful,

239
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,751
hooked into everything,
trusted to run it all.

240
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,237
They say it got smart -
a new order of intelligence.

241
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,789
Then it saw all people as a threat.
Not just the ones on the other side.

242
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,673
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

243
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,076
Extermination.

244
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,830
Did you see this war?

245
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,710
No. I grew up after. In the ruins.

246
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,798
Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.

247
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,673
- H-Ks?
- Hunter-killers.

248
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,554
Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

249
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,117
Most of us were rounded up.
Put in camps for orderly disposal.

250
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,954
This was burned in by laser scanner.

251
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,639
Some of us were kept alive. To work.

252
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,234
Loading bodies.

253
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,920
The disposal units ran night and day.

254
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,998
We were that close to going out for ever.

255
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,476
But there was one man
who taught us to fight.

256
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,556
To storm the wire of the camps.

257
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,116
To smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk.

258
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,198
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.

259
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,472
His name was Connor. John Connor.

260
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,037
Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.

261
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,998
Drive.

262
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,634
Reese!

263
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,390
No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.

264
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,149
You in the Cadillac,
let me see your hands now.

265
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,875
Get out of the car.

266
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,196
Drop to your knees.

267
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,471
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

268
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,832
Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.

269
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,436
Listen, are you sure it's them?

270
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,438
I mean,
maybe I should look at the bodies.

271
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,599
No. They've been identified
and there's no doubt.

272
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:01,471
Ginger. Kiddo.

273
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,988
- Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

274
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,999
Tell him everything Reese told you,
Sarah. Do you feel up to that?

275
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,076
Yeah, I guess so.

276
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,628
- You're a doctor?
- Criminal psychologist.

277
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:23,356
- Is Reese crazy?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

278
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,949
So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom?

279
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:54,393
With the 132nd under Perry.
From '21 to '27.

280
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,193
That's the year 2027?

281
00:50:57,892 --> 00:50:59,847
<i>That's right. Then I was assigned...</i>

282
00:50:59,972 --> 00:51:03,601
<i>- This is fucking great.
...under John Connor.</i>

283
00:51:03,732 --> 00:51:06,689
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defense system...

284
00:51:06,811 --> 00:51:09,006
Goddamn! Sorry.

285
00:51:09,131 --> 00:51:12,487
...built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdyne Systems.

286
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,568
I see.

287
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:20,243
And this computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy.

288
00:51:20,371 --> 00:51:23,522
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived.

289
00:51:23,651 --> 00:51:25,801
A sort of retroactive abortion?

290
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:30,606
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.

291
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,721
- He screwed it first...
- Ed, shut up.

292
00:51:32,851 --> 00:51:35,411
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

293
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,964
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

294
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:42,367
It had no choice.
Their defense grid was smashed.

295
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:46,687
We'd won. Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.

296
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:49,608
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

297
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:54,326
Is that when you captured the lab
complex and found... What is it called?

298
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:56,804
The time displacement equipment?

299
00:51:56,929 --> 00:52:00,604
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

300
00:52:00,729 --> 00:52:03,641
Connor sent me to intercept
and they blew the whole place.

301
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:06,329
Well, how are you supposed to get back?

302
00:52:06,449 --> 00:52:08,405
I can't.

303
00:52:09,449 --> 00:52:14,397
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.

304
00:52:15,528 --> 00:52:18,885
It's just him and me.

305
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:01,437
<i>It's just him and me.</i>

306
00:54:04,363 --> 00:54:09,278
<i>Why didn't you bring any weapons?
Something more advanced.</i>

307
00:54:09,404 --> 00:54:12,156
<i>Don't you have ray guns?</i>

308
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:15,673
<i>- Ray guns.
- Show me a piece of future technology.</i>

309
00:54:15,803 --> 00:54:20,273
<i>You go naked. Something about the
field generated by a living organism.</i>

310
00:54:20,403 --> 00:54:23,951
<i>Nothing dead will go.
I didn't build the fucking thing.</i>

311
00:54:24,082 --> 00:54:28,394
<i>OK, OK. But this cyborg, if it's metal...?</i>

312
00:54:28,522 --> 00:54:31,878
<i>- Surrounded by living tissue.
- Oh, right.</i>

313
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,721
Great stuff.
I could make a career out of this guy.

314
00:54:34,842 --> 00:54:37,675
See how clever it is?
It doesn't require a shred of proof.

315
00:54:37,802 --> 00:54:42,239
Most paranoid delusions are intricate,
but this is brilliant.

316
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:46,877
<i>- Why were the other women killed?
- Records were lost in the war.</i>

317
00:54:47,001 --> 00:54:49,561
<i>Skynet knew almost nothing
about Connor's mother.</i>

318
00:54:49,681 --> 00:54:53,230
<i>Her full name, where she lived.
They just knew the city.</i>

319
00:54:53,361 --> 00:54:56,114
<i>The Terminator was
just being systematic.</i>

320
00:54:56,241 --> 00:54:58,914
<i>- Let's go back...
- Look, you have heard enough.</i>

321
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:02,238
<i>I have answered your questions.
I have to see Sarah Connor.</i>

322
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,036
<i>- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?</i>

323
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,117
<i>- Who is in authority here?
- Please...</i>

324
00:55:08,241 --> 00:55:10,196
<i>Shut up!</i>

325
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:12,881
<i>You still don't get it, do you?</i>

326
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,028
<i>He'll find her. That's what he does.
That's all he does.</i>

327
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:23,517
<i>You can't stop him. He'll reach down
her throat and pull her fucking heart out!</i>

328
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:26,029
<i>- Doc.
- Let go of me!</i>

329
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:32,116
Sorry.

330
00:55:35,759 --> 00:55:37,317
He's crazy?

331
00:55:37,439 --> 00:55:40,715
In technical terminology, he's a loon.

332
00:55:41,399 --> 00:55:46,553
Sarah, this is what they call body armor.
Our TAC guys wear these.

333
00:55:46,678 --> 00:55:48,829
It'll stop a 12-gauge round.

334
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:53,031
This other man must've been wearing
one under his coat. Feel that.

335
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:58,592
- He punched through the windshield.
- He was probably on PCP.

336
00:55:58,718 --> 00:56:01,312
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn't feel it.

337
00:56:01,438 --> 00:56:03,793
There was this guy once...
You see this scar?

338
00:56:03,918 --> 00:56:05,874
Thank you.

339
00:56:05,998 --> 00:56:09,433
There's a couch in this other room.
Stretch out and get some sleep.

340
00:56:09,558 --> 00:56:11,992
Be at least an hour
before your mother gets here.

341
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:15,155
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

342
00:56:15,278 --> 00:56:19,236
It may not look it,
but that couch is very comfortable.

343
00:56:20,517 --> 00:56:24,476
You'll be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.

344
00:56:25,517 --> 00:56:27,473
Thank you.

345
00:56:33,037 --> 00:56:34,992
- Good night.
- Good night.

346
00:56:48,876 --> 00:56:52,391
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she's here. Could I see her?

347
00:56:52,516 --> 00:56:54,950
No. Can't see her.
She's making a statement.

348
00:56:55,076 --> 00:56:56,634
Where is she?

349
00:56:56,756 --> 00:57:01,306
It make take a while. If you wanna wait,
there's a bench over there.

350
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:12,392
I'll be back.

351
00:58:05,713 --> 00:58:07,668
Stay here.

352
00:58:45,351 --> 00:58:47,306
Watch him.

353
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:53,539
Ed...

354
01:00:20,666 --> 01:00:23,226
Sarah!

355
01:00:23,346 --> 01:00:25,302
Reese.

356
01:00:28,306 --> 01:00:29,659
This way.

357
01:01:08,744 --> 01:01:11,133
<i>KFLB news time. 4.36.</i>

358
01:01:11,224 --> 01:01:14,374
<i>Top story - the largest single
law enforcement mobilization</i>

359
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,462

360
01:01:17,584 --> 01:01:21,292

361
01:01:24,623 --> 01:01:26,579
Take this.

362
01:01:28,903 --> 01:01:31,463
All right. Let's get this off the road.

363
01:02:01,142 --> 01:02:04,258
- You cold?
- Freezing.

364
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,457
Reese?

365
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,695
- You got a first name?
- Kyle.

366
01:02:24,021 --> 01:02:28,172
Kyle, what's it like
when you go through time?

367
01:02:30,861 --> 01:02:32,816
White light.

368
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,896
Pain.

369
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:43,418
- It's like being born maybe.
- My God.

370
01:02:44,259 --> 01:02:46,216
I caught one back there.

371
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,298
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

372
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:54,649
- We gotta get you to a doctor.
- It's OK. Forget it.

373
01:02:54,779 --> 01:02:59,489
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy? Take this off.

374
01:03:10,978 --> 01:03:12,730
Jesus.

375
01:03:12,859 --> 01:03:15,326
See? It passed right through the meat.

376
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,767
This is gonna make me puke.

377
01:03:17,898 --> 01:03:20,935
- Would you just talk about something?
- What?

378
01:03:21,058 --> 01:03:25,414
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

379
01:03:26,218 --> 01:03:28,173
He's about my height.

380
01:03:31,258 --> 01:03:33,407
He has your eyes.

381
01:03:36,377 --> 01:03:38,334
What's he like?

382
01:03:38,457 --> 01:03:42,006
You trust him. He's got a strength.

383
01:03:43,616 --> 01:03:45,653
I'd die for John Connor.

384
01:03:48,336 --> 01:03:51,773
Well, at least now I know
what to name him.

385
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:57,447
Don't suppose you know who the father is
so I won't tell him to get lost?

386
01:03:57,576 --> 01:04:00,330
John never said much about him.

387
01:04:00,456 --> 01:04:03,414
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait.

388
01:04:04,816 --> 01:04:07,376
I don't wanna know.

389
01:04:07,495 --> 01:04:10,771
So was it John that sent you here?

390
01:04:10,895 --> 01:04:13,456
I volunteered.

391
01:04:13,576 --> 01:04:18,206
- Why?
- It was a chance to meet the legend.

392
01:04:18,335 --> 01:04:24,888
Sarah Connor,
who taught her son to fight, organize,

393
01:04:25,015 --> 01:04:27,084
prepare from when he was a kid.

394
01:04:27,215 --> 01:04:30,763
When you were in hiding before the war.

395
01:04:33,094 --> 01:04:36,405
You're talking about things
I haven't done yet in the past tense.

396
01:04:36,535 --> 01:04:38,968
It's driving me crazy.

397
01:04:42,134 --> 01:04:44,489
Are you sure you have the right person?

398
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,684
I'm sure.

399
01:04:46,814 --> 01:04:50,567
Come on! Do I look like
the mother of the future?

400
01:04:52,294 --> 01:04:57,049
I mean, am I tough? Organized?
I can't even balance my chequebook.

401
01:05:00,053 --> 01:05:03,807
Look, Reese, I didn't ask
for this honor and I don't want it.

402
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,163
Any of it.

403
01:05:08,253 --> 01:05:13,168
Your son gave me a message
to give to you. Made me memorize it.

404
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:16,250
Thank you, Sarah,
for your courage through the dark years.

405
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:20,844
I can't help you with what you must
soon face. The future is not set.

406
01:05:20,972 --> 01:05:23,406
You must be stronger than
you imagine you can be.

407
01:05:23,532 --> 01:05:26,729
You must survive or I will never exist.

408
01:05:26,853 --> 01:05:28,808
That's all.

409
01:05:31,532 --> 01:05:34,205
It's a good field dressing.

410
01:05:34,332 --> 01:05:36,288
You like it?

411
01:05:36,412 --> 01:05:38,561
It's my first.

412
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:44,532
Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.

413
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,322
OK.

414
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:01,920
Talk to me some more.

415
01:06:04,731 --> 01:06:07,119
About what?

416
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:09,810
Tell me about where you're from.

417
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:13,686
All right.

418
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:19,367
You stay down by day,
but at night you can move around.

419
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:24,438
You still have to be careful
because the H-Ks use infrared.

420
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:30,487
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.

421
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:33,889
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

422
01:06:34,009 --> 01:06:37,558
The Terminators were the newest.
The worst.

423
01:06:46,768 --> 01:06:51,922
<i>Traversing your sector in search mode.
750 meters north of your position.</i>

424
01:06:56,288 --> 01:06:58,244
Let's go.

425
01:07:40,926 --> 01:07:43,963
- Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

426
01:09:12,322 --> 01:09:14,994
Terminator!

427
01:10:28,398 --> 01:10:31,390
I was dreaming about dogs.

428
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:34,476
We use 'em to spot Terminators.

429
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:38,315
Your world is pretty terrifying.

430
01:11:14,676 --> 01:11:18,429
Hey, buddy,
you got a dead cat in there or what?

431
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:27,472
Fuck you, asshole.

432
01:11:45,675 --> 01:11:47,427
God damn.

433
01:11:48,275 --> 01:11:49,832
Thank you.

434
01:11:54,994 --> 01:11:56,985
Is this enough?

435
01:11:57,114 --> 01:12:01,073
Yeah, it's enough.
I don't wanna ask where you got it.

436
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,070
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.

437
01:12:08,194 --> 01:12:11,185
- With a kitchen.
- Do you have one with a kitchen?

438
01:12:26,752 --> 01:12:29,108
I am dying for a shower.

439
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:33,392
We should check your bandage, too.

440
01:12:33,512 --> 01:12:36,948
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

441
01:12:40,672 --> 01:12:42,629
Keep this.

442
01:13:06,551 --> 01:13:09,941
No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.

443
01:13:10,071 --> 01:13:12,062
<i>I need to know where to reach you.</i>

444
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:17,184
<i>You tell me to hide out at the cabin
and you won't tell me what's going on?</i>

445
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,461
<i>I am worried sick here.</i>

446
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:23,939
OK. OK, here's the number.

447
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:26,265
<i>- You ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.</i>

448
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:32,659
<i>It's 4085551439. Room nine.</i>

449
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:34,587
<i>- Got it?
- I've got it.</i>

450
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:38,908
<i>I gotta go. I'm sorry
I can't tell you more right now.</i>

451
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:40,985
<i>I love you, Mom.</i>

452
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:46,549
I love you, too, sweetheart.

453
01:13:58,028 --> 01:14:00,462
<i>- Tiki Motel.
- Give me your address there.</i>

454
01:14:03,989 --> 01:14:05,944
What have we got?

455
01:14:08,548 --> 01:14:14,339
Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.

456
01:14:14,468 --> 01:14:16,618
What's for dinner?

457
01:14:16,747 --> 01:14:19,785
- Plastique.
- That sounds good.

458
01:14:19,907 --> 01:14:21,864
What is it?

459
01:14:21,988 --> 01:14:25,423
It's a nitroglycerin base.
It's a bit more stable.

460
01:14:25,548 --> 01:14:28,301
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

461
01:14:38,867 --> 01:14:41,427
Make sure there's none on the threads.

462
01:14:42,907 --> 01:14:44,862
Like this.

463
01:14:46,266 --> 01:14:48,416
Screw the end cap on.

464
01:14:49,867 --> 01:14:52,016
Very gently.

465
01:14:53,986 --> 01:14:56,341
You must've had a fun childhood.

466
01:14:59,785 --> 01:15:01,538
That's good.

467
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:06,420
All right. Six more like that
and I'll get started on the fuses.

468
01:15:16,145 --> 01:15:18,500
He'll find us, won't he?

469
01:15:20,665 --> 01:15:22,621
Probably.

470
01:15:39,304 --> 01:15:41,864
It'll never be over, will it?

471
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,654
Look at me. I'm shaking.

472
01:15:52,663 --> 01:15:57,612
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.

473
01:15:58,624 --> 01:16:02,172
No, I'm not.

474
01:16:10,783 --> 01:16:14,775
Kyle, the women in your time,

475
01:16:15,902 --> 01:16:18,052
what are they like?

476
01:16:19,902 --> 01:16:21,858
Good fighters.

477
01:16:21,982 --> 01:16:24,542
That's not what I meant.

478
01:16:26,062 --> 01:16:28,416
Was there someone special?

479
01:16:29,822 --> 01:16:31,573
Someone...?

480
01:16:31,701 --> 01:16:33,852
A girl, you know.

481
01:16:35,301 --> 01:16:37,257
No.

482
01:16:39,501 --> 01:16:41,458
Never.

483
01:16:42,501 --> 01:16:44,457
Never?

484
01:16:48,821 --> 01:16:51,972
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

485
01:16:55,021 --> 01:16:56,976
So much pain.

486
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:02,378
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

487
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:05,693
So you feel nothing?

488
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:12,658
John Connor gave me
a picture of you once.

489
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:17,218
I didn't know why at the time.

490
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:23,096
It was very old, torn, faded.

491
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:32,853
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just a little sad.

492
01:17:33,898 --> 01:17:37,891
I used to always wonder
what you were thinking at that moment.

493
01:17:38,018 --> 01:17:41,374
I memorized every line,

494
01:17:41,498 --> 01:17:43,455
every curve.

495
01:17:46,698 --> 01:17:50,373
I came across time for you, Sarah.

496
01:17:50,498 --> 01:17:54,536
I love you. I always have.

497
01:18:11,697 --> 01:18:14,052
I shouldn't have said that.

498
01:19:40,653 --> 01:19:43,213
Think fast.

499
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:10,085
Trade places.

500
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:23,478
Faster. Drive faster.

501
01:22:11,086 --> 01:22:14,123
Kyle. Oh, my God.

502
01:23:18,963 --> 01:23:21,318
You stay here.

503
01:23:43,202 --> 01:23:45,157
Let's get outta here.

504
01:23:47,842 --> 01:23:49,991
Get out.

505
01:24:05,481 --> 01:24:08,279
Kyle. Come on. Get up.

506
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,999
Come on.

507
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,793
Help me. Get out. Get out.

508
01:24:45,959 --> 01:24:48,348
Don't stop. Run.

509
01:26:55,153 --> 01:26:57,303
Sarah.

510
01:26:57,433 --> 01:26:59,185
Kyle.

511
01:27:08,232 --> 01:27:11,190
We did it, Kyle. We got him.

512
01:27:29,991 --> 01:27:31,140
No.

513
01:28:26,508 --> 01:28:27,942
Wait.

514
01:28:32,308 --> 01:28:34,617
What are you doing?

515
01:28:34,748 --> 01:28:36,978
Cover, so he can't track us.

516
01:28:47,068 --> 01:28:49,423
Come on.

517
01:28:50,307 --> 01:28:53,744
No. Kyle. Come on.

518
01:28:54,507 --> 01:28:57,544
- Come on.
- Leave me here.

519
01:29:06,867 --> 01:29:11,304
Move it, Reese. On your feet, soldier.

520
01:29:11,427 --> 01:29:14,736
On your feet. Move it.

521
01:30:23,863 --> 01:30:25,819
Get back. Go back.

522
01:30:58,782 --> 01:31:00,579
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

523
01:31:00,701 --> 01:31:02,374
Run.

524
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:07,253
Run.

525
01:31:07,381 --> 01:31:09,895
Come on, motherfucker.

526
01:32:57,737 --> 01:32:59,488
No.

527
01:34:53,291 --> 01:34:55,441
You're terminated, fucker.

528
01:35:50,488 --> 01:35:52,444
Kyle.

529
01:36:12,128 --> 01:36:15,483
Seven. November 10. Where was I?

530
01:36:16,647 --> 01:36:20,276
What's difficult is trying to decide
what to tell you and what not to.

531
01:36:20,767 --> 01:36:24,918
But I guess I have a while before you're
old enough to understand these tapes.

532
01:36:25,047 --> 01:36:29,802
They're more for me at this point
just so that I can get it straight.

533
01:37:04,285 --> 01:37:06,241
Fill her up.

534
01:37:09,524 --> 01:37:12,039
Should I tell you about your father?

535
01:37:12,164 --> 01:37:14,315
Boy, that's a tough one.

536
01:37:15,764 --> 01:37:21,203
Will it effect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

537
01:37:22,124 --> 01:37:24,877
If you don't send Kyle, you can never be.

538
01:37:25,004 --> 01:37:27,962
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

539
01:37:31,523 --> 01:37:34,799
I suppose I will tell you.

540
01:37:34,923 --> 01:37:37,074
I owe him that.

541
01:37:39,163 --> 01:37:41,519
Maybe it'll help if...

542
01:37:41,643 --> 01:37:46,592
you know that in the few hours
that we had together,

543
01:37:48,323 --> 01:37:50,917
we loved a lifetime's worth.

544
01:38:03,002 --> 01:38:06,597
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful.

545
01:38:06,722 --> 01:38:09,680
He is ashamed to ask you
for five dollars for this picture.

546
01:38:09,802 --> 01:38:12,998
But if he doesn't, his father will beat him.

547
01:38:13,121 --> 01:38:16,000
Pretty good hustle, kid.

548
01:38:31,481 --> 01:38:33,597
What did he just say?

549
01:38:33,721 --> 01:38:36,678
He said there's a storm coming in.

550
01:38:40,041 --> 01:38:41,996
I know.

551
01:38:42,305 --> 01:38:48,919
