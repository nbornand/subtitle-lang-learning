one step towards the chair.

you take one step back...

If you reach the chair,
you sit down.

you can go.

When your mother and father
were first divorced,

189

your mom went to see a doctor
like me, and he didn't hello her.

You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

Your dad gave you that watch

How come?

Well, sometimes we do things
to draw attention,

to express our feelings
about certain issues--

278

279
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,275

leave something on the desk

[Cole] No.

282
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,439
[Malcolm] Free association writing
is when you take a pencil in your hand,

283
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,680
and you put the pencil to a piece
of paper and you start writing.

284
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,314
And you don't look
at what you're writing or
think about what you're writing.

You just keep
your hand moving.

anymore, am I ?

865
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,119
I think we said everything
we needed to say.

866
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,438
Maybe it's time to say things
to someone closer to you.

867
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:33,318
Maybe we can qretend like we're
gonna see each other tomorrow.

868
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,790
Just for qretend.

869
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,070
Okay.

870
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,475
I'm gonna go now.

871
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,595
I'll see you
tomorrow, Cole.

- [Chattering, Indistinct]

873
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:30,116
I'm okay, Officer.
l-I'm okay.

874
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,390
I don't know
what happened.

875
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,318
[Lynn] Hmm.

876
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,398
Geez, I hope
nobody got hurt.

877
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,438
You're very quiet.

878
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:52,677
You're mad I missed
the play, aren't you?

879
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,030
I have two jobs, baby.

880
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:57,958
You know how important
they are for us.

881
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,877
[Sighs]

882
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,275
I'd give anything
to have been there.

883
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,910
I'm ready to communicate
with you now.

884
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,916
Communicate?

885
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,670
Tell you my secrets.

886
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,549
What is it?

887
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,839
You know the accident
uq there?

888
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,793
Yeah.

889
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,876
Someone got hurt.

890
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,036
They did?

891
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:47,516
A lady.

892
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:49,756
She died.

893
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,189
Oh, my God.
What, you can see her ?

894
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,552
- Yes.
- Where is she?

895
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,709
Standing next to
my window.

896
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,398
Cole, you're
scaring me.

897
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,715
They scare me too
sometimes.

898
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,396
They?

899
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,997
Ghosts.

900
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:30,595
You see ghosts, Cole?

901
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:35,353
They want me to
do things for them.

902
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,190
They--
They talk to you?

903
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,278
They tell you
to do things?

904
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:47,158
They're the ones
that used to hurt me.

905
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,194
What are you
thinking, Mama?

906
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:55,757
- You think I'm a freak?
- Look at my face.

907
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,678
I would never think that
about you. Ever.

908
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,269
- Got it?
- Got it.

909
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,276
Just let me think
for a minute.

910
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,996
Grandma says hi.

911
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:23,352
She says she's sorry for
taking the bumblebee pendant.

912
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,994
She just
likes it a lot.

913
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:32,069
- What?
- Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

914
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:37,000
Cole, that's
very wrong.

915
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,554
- Grandma's gone, you know that.
- I know.

916
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,797
- She wanted me to tell you--
- Cole, please stop.

917
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:45,514
She wanted me to tell you
she saw you dance.

918
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:50,596
She said
when you were little,

919
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,517
you and her
had a fight...

920
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:55,234
right before
your dance recital.

921
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:01,911
- [Sniffles]
- You thought she didn't come
to see you dance.

922
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,835
She did.

923
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:16,669
She hid in the back
so you wouldn't see.

924
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,439
Sh-She said you were
like an angel.

925
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,911
- [Sobbing]
- She said...

926
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:29,316
you came to the place
where they buried her,

927
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,789
asked her a question.

928
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:40,359
She said
the answer is...

929
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,311
every day.

930
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,189
What did you ask?

931
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:50,392
[Sniffles]

932
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:53,353
[Voice Breaking]

933
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,917
Do--

934
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:01,555
Do I make her qroud?

935
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,315
[Sobbing]
Mama.

936
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,110
[Sobbing]

937
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:27,913
[Laughing, Chattering]

938
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,909
[Man] Hi, everybody.
As most of you know,

939
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,508
I'm not
used to doing this,

940
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:43,076
and I promised Anna
that I'd try not to embarrass her.

941
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:47,159
I'll leave that to her mother.
[Chuckles]

942
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,316
But we do want to thank
all of you for coming...

943
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:52,113
and for sharing
this wonderful day with us.

944
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:54,913
It's bittersweet almost,
for me,

945
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,110
'cause I hate
giving her up.

946
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:59,276
[Malcolm] Anna?

947
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,948
[Applause On Television]

948
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:10,591
I miss you.

949
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:18,714
I miss you too.

950
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,479
Why, Malcolm?

951
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,194
What?

952
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:29,356
- What is it?
- Why did you leave me?

953
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:32,597
I didn't leave you.

954
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:38,717
[Object Clatters]

955
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:56,035
[Cole] I see people.

956
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:58,469
They don't know
they're dead.

957
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:07,036
- [Malcolm] How often
do you see them?
- [Cole] All the time.

958
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,392
[Cole] They're everywhere.

959
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,709
They only see
what they want to see.

960
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:33,276
[Malcolm On TV] Okay, Mikey.

961
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,472
Come on.
Give me a minute.

- Oh, God.
- [Groaning]

970
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:18,790
- [Mumbling] It doesn't even hurt.
- Let me see.

971
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:24,352
- Let me see. Put your hand--
- [Groaning]

972
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,596
Oh, God.

973
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,756

[Sobbing]

976
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:55,549
I think I'm okay.
Really, I think it just went--

977
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,875
went in and out.

978
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,877
It doesn't even
hurt anymore.

979
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,429
I think
I can go now.

980
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,315
I just needed
to do a couqle things.

981
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,794
I needed
to hello someone.

982
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:52,396
I think I did.

983
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,840
And I needed
to tell you something.

984
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:08,438
You were never second.

985
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,994
Ever.

986
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:15,674
I love you.

987
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:23,150
You sleep now.

988
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:27,474
Everything will be
different in the morning.

989
