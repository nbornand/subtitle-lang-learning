2
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,361
Take aim!

3
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,657
We're dying for our country
and our freedom!

4
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,243
- Long live Mexico!
- Fire!

5
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,955
Kill me, kill me, you bastard!

6
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,498
Kill me!

7
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:02,228
A BULLET FOR THE GENERAL

8
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,523
- Hey, there's a line.
- Go to the end of the line!

9
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,775
Where do you think you're going?

10
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,611
- Where are you going?
- As far as the train goes.

11
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,490
- As far as Durango.
- Okay. To Durango, then.

12
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,243
Senor.

13
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,995
Are you from the United States?

14
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,872
Senor.

15
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:24,667
- Do you like Mexico?
- No, I don't.

16
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,633
- Look, there's a man on the tracks!
- Look!

17
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,009
Stop! Stop!

18
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,011
Driver!

19
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,723
Can't you see there's a man there?
Stop, by God!

20
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,685
Lieutenant!
Call the lieutenant.

21
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,104
Where's the lieutenant?

22
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,815
- Why did we stop?
- I don't know.

23
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,817
Driver!

24
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,072
- What are we waiting for?
- There's a man on the tracks.

25
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,199
A man? Who is it?

26
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,910
He's tied to the tracks...

27
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,746
with chains.

28
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,581
He looks like an officer.

29
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,918
- Is he alive?
- Yes, he's alive.

30
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:58,714
Sergeant, tell the men
on the flatcars to be on the alert!

31
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,052
You soldiers up on the engine, get down!

32
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,428
Go unchain him!

33
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,811
He has a captain's uniform!

34
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,729
What's going on?

35
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,780
Help!

36
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,923
- Where's Rosalba?
- Mama! I'm here!

37
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,801
- My child is with you!
- Yes, over here!

38
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,513
Lieutenant, why aren't we moving?

39
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,849
We have no cover up here.

40
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:56,856
Driver, get as close as you can,

41
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,275
but don't run him over.

42
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,110
Yes, Lieutenant.

43
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,119
It's impossible.
It's impossible.

44
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:16,333
- Sergeant, send two men down.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,462
Giamo, Gomez, hop to it!

46
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,308
They're shooting
from the other side as well!

47
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,187
You guys go to the other side!
Shoot toward the mountain!

48
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,148
Fire!

49
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,418
Here I am!

50
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,349
We're going to have a party!

51
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,653
They're going to kill us!
Let's move!

52
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,864
Paulito, take cover!

53
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,367
Let's go! Driver!

54
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,120
That's it! I'm not staying here.

55
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,455
García, stop!

56
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,543
Are you crazy?
Come back, García!

57
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,469
Lieutenant, we have to get out of here!

58
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,223
Tell the driver to move,
or they'll kill us all!

59
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:03,149
Captain, I'm Lieutenant Alvaro Ferreira!

60
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,776
I belong to the 7th Rurales Regiment.

61
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:11,407
I await your orders.
I don't know what to do.

62
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,702
I'm Captain Enrique Sanchez Campoy

63
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,246
of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment.

64
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,709
I'm sorry to be the cause
of these complications, Lieutenant.

65
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,170
Give me my orders!

66
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,922
Decide what I should do!

67
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,508
You decide, Lieutenant.

68
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:30,718
I can't.

69
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:34,930
- What?
- I can't!

70
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:41,312
Sergeant!

71
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,608
Answer me, by God!

72
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,736
The sergeant is dead.

73
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,049
Officer, can you hear me?

74
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:17,932
If you leave us your weapons,
I'll let you go home.

75
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,769
I'll let you go back to your wife.

76
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,230
Officer!

77
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,068
You're busting my balls!

78
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:35,282
And when my balls get busted,
things get ugly.

79
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:39,078
I'm going to find a safer place.
I'm leaving!

80
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,247
No! They'll get you!

81
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,998
Come back!

82
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,009
What the devil can we do?

83
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,724
Are they revolutionaries?

84
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,687
They're damned rebels.
Sons of bitches!

85
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,147
- What do they want?
- Our hides.

86
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,525
No way they'll let us live.

87
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,822
Captain, I await your orders!

88
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,283
Don't ask me.

89
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,785
What kind of an officer are you?

90
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,204
You're nothing but a coward!

91
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,333
Take responsibility for your actions.

92
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:34,717
I know I'm responsible for my men,
but I can't kill you!

93
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,678
One man is worth less than sixty.

94
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,764
All right, then.

95
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,853
Bastards! God damn them all.

96
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,410
Muchachos, leave the officer to me!

97
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,231
Driver!

98
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,894
Achilos, stop the train!

99
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,687
Hurry!

100
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,982
!Vamos! To the train!

101
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,443
!Andale!

102
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,988
Let's go, Achilos.

103
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,122
Adelita!

104
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,917
The horses! !Vamos!

105
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,378
Let's go, muchachos!

106
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,178
!Adelante!

107
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,424
What's he doing?
Hey, you can't go there!

108
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,804
They killed Matías!

109
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,099
Bastards!

110
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,810
Over there!
The train's stopping!

111
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,479
Let's go!

112
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,449
We're with God and the people.

113
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,660
We fight for God and the people.

114
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,580
We're your brothers!

115
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,915
Have no fear!

116
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:26,174
Nino, did you stop the train?

117
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,552
Yes.

118
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:33,682
- You killed the driver and the soldier?
- Yes, I found a gun.

119
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,772
With handcuffs?

120
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:48,071
How did you do that?
Tell me how you shot them with cuffs on.

121
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,699
Like this.

122
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,331
Easy, nino, easy.

123
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,167
So tell me, why did you do it?

124
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:04,421
They were taking me to the border.

125
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,965
- To El Paso?
- Yes.

126
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,216
Why?

127
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,304
- There's a bounty on my head.
- Oh, yeah?

128
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,682
How much are you worth?
How much money?

129
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,269
Not as much as a train.

130
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,273
I get it.

131
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:26,234
You've already paid me
by giving me the train.

132
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,280
All right, nino, I'm in a hurry.

133
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,449
Hands in the air.

134
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,994
Hands in the air!
Get 'em up!

135
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,839
Nino, we're even now.
Go back to your mother.

136
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:51,176
Muchachos, leave the civilians alone!

137
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,679
Just take the weapons!

138
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,515
And all the ammunition you can find!

139
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,850
!Viva México!

140
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,023
- Is there a machine gun?
- No, only rifles.

141
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:08,735
Where do these bastards
keep the machine guns?

142
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,906
- Vicente, any machine guns?
- Nothing!

143
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,118
...in peace. Amen.

144
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,290
And you?

145
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,794
Who are you?

146
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,840
A priest living with those thieves?

147
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,761
Christ died between two thieves.

148
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,514
God is with the poor and the oppressed.

149
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,184
If you're a good priest,
you should know that.

150
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,738
Don't touch him!
Respect the dead!

151
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:56,074
- Get out of here.
- I said leave him alone!

152
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,969
Hold it right there, you bastard.

153
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,109
He killed me!
He killed me!

154
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,406
They're going to kill us!

155
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,467
They killed them!

156
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,649
Achilos, the mules.

157
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,692
Load the munitions on their backs.

158
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,537
They're going to kill us all!

159
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,930
Quickly, muchachos!

160
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,306
Let's go.

161
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,315
- Who's that?
- The gringo who stopped the train.

162
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,776
Nice.

163
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,529
Look. Do you want it?

164
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,490
Do you want it?
I got it for you.

165
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,584
- Where are you going, nino?
- I'm coming with you.

166
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,128
Hear that, boys?

167
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,047
This nino wants to come with us.

168
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,929
- Why?
- I don't want to be hanged.

169
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,265
I understand.

170
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:29,019
- If they catch me, I'm done for.
- Oh, yeah?

171
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,229
I stopped the train.

172
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,940
Besides, you need men.
You lost several today.

173
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:38,069
One. Matías, poor guy.
He's gone forever.

174
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:43,450
Guapo, what do you think of this kid?

175
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,452
If he's brave...

176
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,413
- If he's brave, why not?
- Okay.

177
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:52,792
He stopped the train.
He killed the driver and a soldier.

178
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,712
Two shots, two kills.

179
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,213
Good.

180
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,342
- Picaro?
- All right, but let's get going.

181
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:04,471
- Pepito?
- He's a gringo. I don't like him.

182
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,432
That's why?
Because he's a gringo?

183
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,517
No, because I don't like him.

184
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,812
He's in love.
He doesn't count.

185
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:16,608
- Santo?
- If he helped us, we should help him.

186
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,692
Okay.

187
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,320
But tell him if he's with us,

188
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,406
he's with the revolution.

189
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:26,493
Got it, nino?
Do you like the revolution?

190
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:30,538
Wasn't it the revolution
that shot off my handcuffs?

191
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,084
That's true.

192
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:38,380
It's me.
I'm the revolution.

193
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:46,972
Muchachos, we've found a new comrade!

194
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,057
Let's celebrate!

195
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,613
Oh, Mother of God!

196
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,157
The horse is killing me.

197
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,952
I can't take it anymore.

198
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,956
Buck up, Emilino.

199
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,750
We can't stop. Be brave.

200
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,920
- I can't.
- Hang in there!

201
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,597
Hey, Chuncho!

202
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,392
- Sixty rifles.
- Good.

203
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:36,688
- How much at 30 pesos apiece?
- Sixty times 30 makes...

204
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,441
- A lot.
- 1,800 pesos.

205
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,693
1,800. Thank you, kind sir.

206
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,654
- There are 15 of us. How much apiece?
- One more now, with the gringo.

207
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:48,366
- But Emilino is dying.
- Right. Then one less.

208
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:52,662
- So how much apiece?
- 120 pesos.

209
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,540
- 120 pesos. That's easy.
- That's great!

210
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,377
Hear that, nino?
You made 120 pesos. Happy?

211
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,046
- It's not much.
- I know.

212
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,049
We need to find some machine guns.

213
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,968
They're worth a lot more money.

214
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,804
- What is it, nino?
- Nothing.

215
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,807
- I thought you were revolutionaries.
- We are.

216
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:16,102
Who do we sell our weapons to?
To the revolution.

217
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,564
To General Elías?

218
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,441
My God.

219
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:26,488
Do they know our great general
even in the United States?

220
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,324
I'm glad, gringo.
Look at him!

221
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,242
This is General Elías.

222
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,661
He gave me this medal.
I fought with him.

223
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,247
My brother says he was sent by God.

224
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,582
Hey, Picaro!

225
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,628
Sing one of our songs
for Emilino. He's dying.

226
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:45,423
- I don't feel like it.
- I'll give you five pesos. Sing!

227
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,843
Come on, boys!

228
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,597
Let's all sing! Cheer up!

229
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,808
Adelita!"

230
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,914
Forgive us.

231
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,543
Forgive us for this day.

232
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,549
For today we have shed yet more blood.

233
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:33,012
And we have killed many of our brothers.

234
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,600
But you know that it is only
our love that guides us.

235
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:43,439
Our infinite love
for all the creatures who suffer.

236
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,568
Is he crazy?

237
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,987
He's my brother.

238
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,990
I didn't think he was your brother.
He's blond.

239
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,576
Why not?

240
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,662
Same mother,
and the father, who knows?

241
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,914
We grew up together.

242
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,917
He's the best of all of us.

243
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,006
And he's not crazy!

244
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,593
He's pure...

245
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,304
as pure as a child.

246
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,100
He doesn't know
we get paid for the weapons.

247
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:24,772
He thinks we donate them
for the triumph of the revolution.

248
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:29,652
- Where are we taking the weapons?
- To the headquarters in the Sierra.

249
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:34,115
- Where is that?
- In the mountains, in the Sierra.

250
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,203
- That way?
- Yes...

251
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:42,498
But first we need to collect more weapons.

252
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,305
- Are you coming?
- No.

253
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:01,184
- Why not?
- I don't feel like it tonight.

254
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:13,488
- Is he dead?
- Yes, he's dead.

255
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,993
May he rest in peace.

256
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,703
Amen.

257
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,959
It's cold at night...

258
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,629
if you sleep alone.

259
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:50,525
Nino, I think Adelita likes you.

260
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,695
But watch out for Pepito.

261
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,864
Good night.

262
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,080
He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke...

263
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,208
he doesn't even notice women.

264
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:12,046
- What do you like, nino?
- Money.

265
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,614
- Get me the commander.
- Guard!

266
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,701
The commander is busy.

267
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:47,081
- Why do you want to see him, gringo?
- I'm handing these two criminals over to him.

268
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:51,711
- What have they done?
- They attacked the train I was traveling on.

269
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:59,510
- Bandits or rebels?
- Is there a difference?

270
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,472
No, there's no difference.

271
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:08,227
Well, look at this.

272
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,481
- Are you the guy with the drum?
- Yes, I am.

273
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,570
With our national flag?

274
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,408
You bandit! Guard!

275
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,286
- Inside!
- Let's go. Move!

276
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,789
I said inside! Let's go!

277
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,083
You come along too.

278
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,632
Get a move on!

279
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,260
Walk!

280
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,804
Inside, you pig!

281
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,765
- Go get the commander.
- Yes, sir.

282
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,268
What kind of gringo are you? English?

283
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,813
American.

284
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,482
American!

285
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,151
Tiny heart, lots of money.

286
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:06,369
Who gave you a medal?
Your general?

287
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,913
For all the soldiers you slaughtered?

288
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:12,542
Well, we're going to kill you.

289
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,796
Should we kill you today,

290
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:21,551
or should we kill you tomorrow?

291
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:26,139
Should we kill you today,

292
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:30,601
or should we kill you tomorrow?

293
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:36,566
- Are you pulling my beard?
- Yes, I'm pulling your beard.

294
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,277
Then I'll break your balls!

295
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,779
Hold it, or I'll shoot!

296
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:44,824
Where is he?

297
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,035
Where is this American senor?

298
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,081
I'm Commander Hernández Montoya.

299
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:18,316
Come on. Let's go.

300
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,985
Hurry, Eufemio.

301
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,987
- Kill him!
- Let's hurry it up.

302
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,909
!Rápido!

303
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:31,829
If you touch Adelita, I'll kill you!

304
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,208
Give it to me.

305
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,340
- Give that to me!
- Good.

306
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,301
Pepito! Come on!

307
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,429
- Let's go, muchachos.
- !Hombre!

308
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,765
Give them here.

309
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,435
More soldiers are coming.
They called in reinforcements!

310
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,522
Let's get out of here!

311
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,236
Long live the revolution!

312
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,574
Commander, what's she look like?

313
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:10,201
- Blonde? A brunette?
- Is she pretty?

314
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:14,121
Gentlemen, this is a real woman.

315
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,917
She's stupendous! The most beautiful
that's ever come this way.

316
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,633
Corporal, help the lady.

317
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,553
Fernando, some champagne. Quickly.

318
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,722
- Welcome.
- Welcome, beautiful lady.

319
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,975
- At last!
- Welcome!

320
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,521
Hello, boys!
Dona Dolores sent me.

321
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,314
Good for Dolores!

322
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,400
No more abstinence!

323
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,902
- Muchachos, take it easy with my things.
- Yes, miss.

324
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:47,280
- It's the new girl.
- Reserved for the officers.

325
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,907
- Hello, whore!
- And what are you? A virgin?

326
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:53,744
- Oh, no! I'm a whore.
- We're all whores here.

327
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,413
!Guapa!

328
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,752
- Welcome!
- No more chastity!

329
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,046
Easy. There's some for everyone.

330
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,341
Come here!

331
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,845
Just a minute, gentlemen!

332
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,490
One, two, three-

333
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,287
My sister is a nun,

334
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,914
and she embroiders
very nice hankies for me.

335
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,208
I was good at embroidery too as a child.

336
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:44,837
Dona Dolores is a true friend to the army.
She's our godmother.

337
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,216
What's she doing?

338
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,428
!Senorita!
Come over here.

339
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:02,063
Lieutenant!

340
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,347
- Adelita, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

341
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:40,393
- I give up!
- I give up!

342
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,285
Eufemio, the weapons!

343
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,211
- Is there a machine gun?
- No, nothing.

344
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,130
- Shit!
- Nothing doing.

345
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,229
You can have whatever you want.

346
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,482
No need to get rough.

347
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,026
Come to me, morena!

348
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:38,909
- Are there any machine guns here?
- No, only whores.

349
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,870
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

350
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:45,624
What kind of shitty army
has no machine guns?

351
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,960
Let's get out of here!

352
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,809
Aim! Fire!

353
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:09,148
Did you run out of courage?
Why are you shaking?

354
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,358
Hold it right there!

355
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,487
Aim! Fire!

356
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,159
Let's go get the officers.

357
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,499
- Water.
- Water.

358
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,002
- Have pity on us.
-Water, senor.

359
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,859
This way. Come on.

360
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,653
Come on up.

361
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,989
We have to agree on an exchange
of prisoners for our officers.

362
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,784
- Sorry, you're out of luck.
- Let's talk about it.

363
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,120
- You're just unlucky.
- We can arrange something.

364
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:08,666
Have a little dignity.
Please, sir, hold still!

365
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,752
No, wait!
This is too good for them.

366
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,839
Leave them to me.
Move it!

367
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,006
Quickly!

368
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,217
What are you going to do to them?

369
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,850
Get down there!

370
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,106
Take the ladder out!

371
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,405
Throw the key in the river.

372
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,827
This way you'll die...

373
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,956
a slow death.

374
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,086
You'll have all the time you need
to repent your sins.

375
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,047
Santo, this is no time for your sermons.

376
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,425
We've got to hurry.

377
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,678
Let's go, muchachos.

378
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:17,067
In the name of our president,
Venustiano Carranza...

379
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,695
Stop! Stop!

380
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,531
Why are you decorating criminals?

381
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,576
They've killed women and children.

382
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,536
They've tortured common laborers.

383
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:29,580
They're a disgrace!

384
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,499
They've pillaged, raped, slaughtered,

385
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,085
exterminated poor, innocent victims.

386
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,672
Tigers of Mexico, I curse you!

387
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,507
Is that priest crazy?

388
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:09,703
Nino, get a move on
with the ammunition.

389
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,749
Vamos, let's go!

390
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,097
Chuncho!

391
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,517
There's been an uprising in San Miguel.
The people hold the town.

392
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,270
- And the soldiers?
- They killed them all.

393
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,315
Muchachos, let's go to San Miguel!

394
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,902
Tonight we eat, we drink,
and I want a woman.

395
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,114
What's wrong?

396
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,200
There will be girls
for you too in San Miguel.

397
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,911
Come on. A little revelry!

398
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:37,124
You're always sad, nino.
Let's go.

399
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,712
Let's take the weapons to Elías's camp first.

400
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,756
- Then we can go to San Miguel.
- Come on!

401
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,550
Wake up, nino. If you come
to San Miguel, you won't regret it.

402
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,801
!Vamos!

403
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,220
We'd better go to San Miguel now.

404
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:53,265
You never know when the army will come.

405
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:57,686
And then the party's over, nino.
It's time to live!

406
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,945
- !Vamos, Pepito!
- Let's go dancing!

407
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,205
Long live the revolution!
Long live Mexico!

408
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,220
Long live the revolution!

409
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,472
Chuncho.

410
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,475
Raimundo.

411
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,685
- Crazy man!
- Old fart!

412
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,604
Welcome!

413
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,607
- How are you, Raimundo?
- How are you?

414
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,527
- What happened to your arm?
- Lost.

415
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:50,239
- Where?
- In the last fight with the army.

416
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,407
General Elías said to me,

417
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:57,621
Old man, go home.
You've done enough for the revolution."

418
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,957
How about you?

419
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,583
Me?

420
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,922
I travel with the boys.
I kill soldiers.

421
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:11,135
I steal weapons from the army
and give them to our general.

422
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:14,555
Excellent. Elías needs them.

423
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:23,188
- And who's this?
- An American. He's very brave.

424
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:27,276
A good guy.
A comrade from America.

425
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,404
The United States gives money
to Carranza's government.

426
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,323
- But also to the revolution.
- They used to.

427
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,201
These days, they only help our enemies.

428
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,412
-Why , gringo?
- Why?

429
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,958
I don't know. I'm not friendly with
the president of the United States.

430
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,960
He's not friendly."

431
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,171
- But what do you think?
- Me?

432
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,464
I'm with Chuncho.

433
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:52,092
We take weapons from the army,
and pass them on to the revolution.

434
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:57,306
Of course.

435
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,224
Is he offended?

436
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,393
Oh, well.

437
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:04,479
Let's go celebrate our reunion. !Vamos!

438
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,523
No, wait.

439
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:09,985
First we must kill Don Felipe.

440
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:15,866
- Who's Don Felipe?
- The owner of the lands.

441
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:22,289
All right. Muchachos,
first we're going to kill Don Felipe.

442
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,002
Let's go find this Don Felipe.

443
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:38,597
- Are they coming?
- Yes.

444
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,272
What are you doing? Wait!

445
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:49,608
- What do you think you're doing?
- What you should be doing.

446
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,069
- No, darling. Please don't.
- Go get the cartridges.

447
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,612
Let's not be foolish.

448
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:57,491
- I'm not saying this out of cowardice.
- Coward! Let me go!

449
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,953
We can talk, negotiate.
Raimundo is a reasonable man.

450
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,374
Let's at least preserve our dignity.

451
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:08,085
Oh, God! Oh, God!

452
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,628
I feel ill.

453
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,672
Rafael!

454
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:14,967
It's not fear.
Believe me.

455
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,135
- Rafael!
-Yes, senora.

456
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,595
I truly feel ill.

457
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,264
- Rafael, come quickly!
- I'm right here, senora.

458
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:24,893
- Help me take him to the other room.
- I can't breathe!

459
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,398
Come. Lie down.

460
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,276
I'll talk to those criminals.

461
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:36,154
- Are they all at home?
- Yes, sir, all of them.

462
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:55,299
No, no, that's champagne.
You'll get diarrhea.

463
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:59,011
Drink something else.
Drink red wine, hombre.

464
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,101
Good morning.

465
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,644
Please, come in.

466
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:10,480
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

467
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:14,901
Beatriz, Henriqueta,
more bottles for the gentlemen.

468
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:22,576
Sit down, muchachos.
You too, Adelita.

469
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,875
Senora, where is Don Felipe?

470
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:32,878
We're here to speak with your husband.

471
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:37,007
Senora, excuse me.

472
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,718
Could you pass the cheese?

473
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:46,183
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

474
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:49,561
Senora, please have someone
go get your husband.

475
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,648
My husband is resting right now.

476
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,359
You may speak to me.
There's no difference.

477
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:58,862
- There is a difference, senora.
- Please, sit down.

478
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:03,450
- You're Raimundo, right?
- Yes.

479
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,078
Is your family all right?

480
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,831
Since when are you interested
in my family, senora?

481
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,591
So, what do you want?

482
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,510
- Money?
- No.

483
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:25,055
What do you mean?
It seemed as though that's all you wanted.

484
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,266
- You've done nothing but ask for it.
- That's true.

485
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:31,144
We ask,

486
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,231
and your husband, just so he doesn't
have to give us anything,

487
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:37,150
calls the green hats...

488
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:40,779
the Rurales, our murderers.

489
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:45,242
- No, he didn't call them.
- Yes, senora, he did.

490
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,996
My husband has always been against bloodshed.

491
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,208
- Believe me. My husband-
- Is responsible for our dead!

492
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,211
Let's not talk about the past.

493
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:00,674
Raimundo, let's try
to reach an understanding...

494
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,634
reasonably.

495
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:07,222
- What is it that you want?
- The land.

496
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:11,935
All right.

497
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,021
- We'll see what we can do.
- Nothing, senora.

498
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,526
- The land is ours now.
- Yes, stolen!

499
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,363
- You see, senora...
- Yes?

500
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:30,537
The fact is that these muchachos
would like to kill your husband.

501
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,707
Why?

502
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,376
Why kill him?

503
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,129
What has he done wrong?

504
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,885
And why are you telling me
and not them?

505
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,263
Because...

506
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,141
they're not in the habit of talking.

507
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,393
As children, they were always quiet.

508
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,937
Forget it, Rosario.

509
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:59,191
There's no use in talking.
It's pointless.

510
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:05,405
So, Raimundo,
you've decided to kill me.

511
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,741
Why?
There must be a reason.

512
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,369
Is it just because I'm rich?

513
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:12,996
No, senor.

514
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,874
It's because we're poor,

515
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:19,085
and you've done your best
to keep us that way.

516
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:25,550
- Who is that man?
- He's one of General Elías's men.

517
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:29,763
A brave and decorated soldier
of our revolutionary army.

518
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:33,934
Can you tell me, then,
why they want to kill me?

519
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,773
I understand your question, senor.

520
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:44,069
Felipe, what's happening?

521
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:46,696
It's unfortunate,

522
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,492
but, in this life,
people die sometimes.

523
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,161
- Guapo, toss me the cheese.
- All right.

524
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:56,873
- I have one favor to ask.
- Anything but your life. Ask away.

525
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:59,417
Let me say good-bye
to my mother in there,

526
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:03,380
and let her and my wife leave.

527
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:08,301
- What do you say, Raimundo?
- All right.

528
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:10,470
All right.

529
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:13,431
- Do I have your word?
- You have my word.

530
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,602
But let's get a move on.

531
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,647
Good-bye, dear.

532
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,984
Forgive me if I've disappointed you sometimes.

533
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,820
I've always loved you.

534
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,625
Felipe, what do these people want?

535
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,712
Nothing.
I have to leave with them for a moment.

536
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,672
- Tell me the truth.
- It is the truth.

537
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:50,135
- What kind of a rifle is that?
- It's a precision rifle.

538
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:54,556
Nice. Do you like it?

539
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,600
Here. My gif t to you.

540
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,143
- Enough!
- No.

541
00:48:58,227 --> 00:48:59,603
- Cowards!
- Where are you going?

542
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:04,107
Murderers!
Get out! Get out of here!

543
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:07,402
All of you, out!
Get out of here!

544
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:10,030
- What a beauty.
- I'll call the army!

545
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,698
Thieves!

546
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,201
I'll have you all hanged!
I said get out!

547
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,996
What kind of commander are you?
You're a murderer!

548
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,041
- You're all murderers-
- She's hot!

549
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,132
I'm sorry.

550
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,636
Get ready to leave, senora.

551
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,224
You really want to leave, senora?

552
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,853
Too bad.

553
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,606
I like you and your red hair.

554
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,733
Didn't you give your word?

555
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,818
Words fly away with the wind, nino.

556
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:51,488
- Out of my way! Let me go!
- Come on.

557
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:54,324
Let's have a private party,
just the two of us.

558
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:57,160
Haven't we wasted enough time?
Let her go.

559
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,828
Why are you defending her?

560
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:03,875
I was only 15
when some other Don Felipe raped me!

561
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,753
Why should she get special treatment?

562
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,797
Why?

563
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:14,761
Adelita, look what I found.
It's for you.

564
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,932
Come and try it on.

565
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:26,106
- I like her. I like her.
- And you want to get rich, you clown?

566
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,608
Nino.

567
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:32,445
- Lazy slobs like you don't get rich.
- I'll kill you.

568
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,699
Did you hear that?
The nino is defending the lady.

569
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,285
But the lady wants to stay with us.

570
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:42,997
Can't you see you disgust her?
You smell like a goat!

571
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,751
And you'll smell like a-

572
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:53,591
Chuncho!

573
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,468
Why, Chuncho?

574
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,138
Why?

575
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,725
Chuncho!

576
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,769
What have you done?

577
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,486
Why? Why did you kill him?

578
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:20,618
Because Guapo wanted to kill the nino.

579
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:28,293
And the nino is my friend.

580
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:31,296
Wasn't Guapo your friend too?

581
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:39,012
Guapo is dead.

582
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,973
Don't worry about him.

583
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,100
- What are you yelling about, Eufemio?
- Oh, nothing.

584
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:46,561
I came to tell you
Don Felipe has a car. Come see!

585
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:49,939
A car? That's great.
Let's go see it.

586
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,154
Good-bye, Rafael.

587
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,493
You're happy, aren't you?

588
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:25,183
Stop, stop!

589
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,645
Let's go to San Miguel in the car.

590
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:31,189
To San Miguel!

591
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,160
A car!

592
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,261
- What's that?
- The gear shift.

593
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:04,138
- What's it for?
- To shift gears.

594
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,268
- Do you understand?
- No.

595
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:12,981
- But the horses go faster.
- Don't tire the horses out!

596
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:16,693
Don Felipe, what kind of a car
runs slower than horses?

597
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,695
There are too many of us.

598
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,321
Did you hear that?

599
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,198
Okay, get off.

600
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:23,867
- Get off!
- Down! Down!

601
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,369
- Idiot!
- Get off.

602
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:31,708
And now, drive faster!

603
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,544
Wow, it's nice.

604
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:59,308
You look beautiful tonight, Adelita.

605
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,811
What's up with you, gringo?

606
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:03,813
Nothing.

607
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,984
I wanted to apologize
for not noticing sooner.

608
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:12,029
See? It was a good idea
to come to San Miguel.

609
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:17,451
I thought you didn't like women,

610
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:19,370
but you do.

611
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,584
So, what are you waiting for?

612
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,629
Are you afraid?

613
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:33,426
Of Pepito?

614
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,220
No.

615
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:40,433
- Of what, then?
- Of complications.

616
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,478
Look...

617
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,692
That's never happened to me before.

618
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:53,279
- Why are you here, then?
- To say good-bye.

619
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,281
I'm leaving.

620
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,617
So are we.

621
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:00,620
- When?
- Tomorrow.

622
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,873
No, you're not.

623
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,501
Can't you see Chuncho?
He'll never get tired of the applause.

624
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:11,047
He's starting to appreciate
the revolution again.

625
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,716
Oh, really?

626
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:18,179
And just because they're clapping,
I should give up on my money?

627
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:20,973
After we risked our lives!

628
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:26,687
No way.
I won't give up on it.

629
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:32,276
- Why don't you tell Pepito?
- You bet I will.

630
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,321
Where did that idiot run off to?

631
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,323
Pepito!

632
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:47,208
- Adelita, what is it?
- Come here. I have to talk to you.

633
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,544
And quit drinking!

634
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,429
- What's wrong, my love?
- I've had enough.

635
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,556
I don't want to rot in this town,

636
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:05,393
and I don't want to waste my life
always in the saddle,

637
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:08,688
waiting for the money
from the weapons forever.

638
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:11,065
What's wrong? I don't get it.

639
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,734
Really, you don't get it?

640
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:18,114
What are we doing here?
Chuncho sings, Santo preaches.

641
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:21,617
Everyone's drunk, but when
are we going to deliver the weapons?

642
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:24,120
I want my money, and I'm leaving.

643
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:27,790
After this trip is over, we'll be set.

644
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,711
The trip ends here.
Ask the gringo.

645
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:37,925
What does she mean?

646
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:44,056
I was telling Adelita that Chuncho
has no intention of leaving.

647
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:47,351
Says who?

648
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:51,480
Ask him.
He's over there.

649
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:55,359
What are you waiting for, idiot? Ask him.

650
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:57,903
Go on. Ask him.

651
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:05,369
If everything goes well,

652
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:09,081
I'll take you with me to my country.

653
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:12,001
Together?

654
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,795
To the United States?

655
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,300
Don't make fun of me.

656
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,569
- Do you like me?
- Do you like me?

657
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,197
- Let's go.
- To my house.

658
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,161
Chuncho!

659
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,332
- I need to talk to you.
- Tomorrow.

660
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,210
No, now.
When are we leaving?

661
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:58,464
I know when. When I say so.
When I feel like it.

662
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:00,800
- Let's go.
- Forgive me, querida.

663
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:03,094
Get out of here.

664
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:06,597
Forgive me.
They're so rude.

665
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,767
- Look at the bull!
- The bull of our pueblo!

666
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,399
Eighteen, 19, 20.

667
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,486
- Only 20 cartridges?
- Enough to kill 20 soldiers.

668
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,612
Watch it!

669
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,739
- I don't know how to shoot.
- Then give it back!

670
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:26,867
- Wait! Where are you going?
- No, it's mine and I'm keeping it.

671
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:30,121
Raimundo, a machine gun!
I found a machine gun!

672
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:32,289
- A machine gun?
- A machine gun?

673
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:35,543
There was a machine gun hidden
in the warehouse with tons of bullets.

674
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:38,504
- No kidding!
- And it's brand new.

675
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,172
- Where is it?
- In the warehouse.

676
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,757
Let's go.

677
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,509
Where are you going, my love?

678
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:48,097
It shoots 20 bullets at a time.
It can kill 1,000 soldiers in an hour.

679
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,851
- Who found it?
- Get out of here. Let me see.

680
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:58,190
So beautiful! I've wanted one of these
even more than a woman.

681
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:21,589
Come on, women.
Hurry it up!

682
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,674
Double time!

683
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:31,849
Brother, if the cavalry comes,
we'll roast them on a spit!

684
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:37,229
You said even horses
are God's creatures, didn't you?

685
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:42,276
But not the government's horses!

686
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,489
- Anything new up there?
- Nothing.

687
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:49,450
- Keep your eyes peeled.
- Of course, General.

688
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,993
Excellent.

689
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:26,403
- What's going on?
- I was waiting for you. We're ready.

690
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:28,989
- Ready for what?
- To leave.

691
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:36,247
And the rest of you?
Are you all leaving with him?

692
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,624
No, it's the gringo who's coming with us.

693
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,919
Chuncho, come with us.
The party's over.

694
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:46,549
Our money is waiting for us
at General Elías's camp.

695
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:49,969
What are we waiting for here?
The army?

696
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,514
So they can capture us and the weapons?

697
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:56,850
We can't leave the village
of San Miguel to be slaughtered.

698
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:59,228
And what should we do?
Get slaughtered too?

699
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,813
That's not why we came here.

700
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:06,485
But if we're all here with our weapons...

701
01:05:07,988 --> 01:05:11,615
and with a machine gun,
we at least have a chance.

702
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:14,243
Why take that chance?
I don't get it.

703
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:20,082
We can take more weapons from the army.

704
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,792
- That's something.
- We have so many already.

705
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,503
- No, I'm done.
- We've done enough shooting.

706
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:28,048
The truth is, amigo, you have shit
in your veins instead of blood.

707
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:31,844
Maybe, but living shit
is better than dead shit.

708
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:39,852
- Amigo, shit will always be shit!
- Fine.

709
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:44,315
- Then give me my share of the weapons.
- Give them to him.

710
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,235
- What's his share?
- Thirty rifles.

711
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:51,697
- And the ammunition.
- Four boxes.

712
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:57,369
Come on!
Everybody, gather 'round.

713
01:05:57,454 --> 01:06:00,205
We have to unload the rifles and ammo.

714
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:03,125
Look at these shitty warriors

715
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,961
running away from San Miguel
while the army is on its way.

716
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:08,881
What heroism!

717
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:16,889
Nino.

718
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,726
I'm not mad at you.

719
01:06:21,353 --> 01:06:23,228
You're a gringo.

720
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,731
What do you care about Mexico?

721
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:30,402
- I'd leave regardless.
- Even if you were Mexican?

722
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:33,280
- Why should I stay here?
- For them!

723
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:37,743
- Is it worth it?
- Why? Aren't they men like us?

724
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:43,207
Look at this town, nino.

725
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:47,086
They're poor and dirty, but they're men,
just like us. Look at him.

726
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,838
He doesn't go to the barber
or wear cologne,

727
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:52,466
but he's a man like us.

728
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,677
Go unload the weapons.

729
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,221
Do you understand me, nino?

730
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:00,140
No.

731
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,434
Gringo.

732
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:04,395
Are you coming or not?

733
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,368
Good-bye, General!

734
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:23,330
Chuncho, you can't do
a bunch of things at the same time.

735
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:27,459
You have to do one thing at a time.

736
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,718
The thing that's most worth your while.

737
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:39,096
- So, are you coming?
- No, I'm staying here.

738
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:41,765
Good-bye.

739
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:45,269
- Good-bye, nino.
- Let's go!

740
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:48,856
Be brave!

741
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:54,361
- Good luck, Chuncho.
- Go on, you slut!

742
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,532
Sons of bitches!

743
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,952
I hope you get fucked in the ass!

744
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:06,331
In the ass!
That's where your motherland is!

745
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,335
Let's go.

746
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,140
Okay, Vicente. Hurry!

747
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:34,318
- What, are you leaving?
- We'll be back. !Adios!

748
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:37,237
Did you see that?
They're leaving San Miguel!

749
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:41,074
Like this.

750
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:43,952
Give me that.

751
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,705
This isn't a stick.

752
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:50,542
It's not a spike.
Is it a spike?

753
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,377
Is it? No?

754
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:55,130
Say no. No, right?

755
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:57,633
It's a rifle, a Mauser.

756
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:01,470
A great rifle.
Everyone, look at it.

757
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:04,765
You open it.

758
01:09:05,934 --> 01:09:07,726
You load it.

759
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,814
You close it.

760
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:14,691
You aim.

761
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:17,069
You fire. Is that clear?

762
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:21,657
Try it.

763
01:09:23,368 --> 01:09:26,078
Go on. Try it.
It's not hard.

764
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:30,374
You open it.

765
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,252
You load it.

766
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,798
You close it.

767
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:40,926
You aim.

768
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,761
And you fire.

769
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,771
- Did you drop this rod?
- No.

770
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:55,858
- So whose is it? Yours?
- Not mine.

771
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,778
Are we done?

772
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,572
Should we try again?

773
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:13,292
- I'm wondering why I stay with you.
- Just because.

774
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:20,007
And why should you stay with me?

775
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:26,179
- Why?
- Because we really like staying with you.

776
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:34,479
Why are you leaving?

777
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:42,237
Chuncho, what's wrong?

778
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:45,574
- Should we try again?
- Go ahead, shoot.

779
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,159
You can kill each other.

780
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,709
You aim.

781
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,586
Like this?

782
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,212
That's good.

783
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:03,634
Get me the machine gun.

784
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,929
Enough. Give me the rifle.

785
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:08,680
Now go home.

786
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,600
- Leave me alone.
- My love, are you coming?

787
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,185
Leave me alone.

788
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:16,521
I don't love you.
I'll throw this at you!

789
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:19,858
- Come on.
- Go away!

790
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,779
Leave me alone!

791
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:26,782
- What's wrong, brother?
- She only wants one thing.

792
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:28,951
She's never satisfied.

793
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:34,039
You know, I was thinking
we shouldn't have let them leave.

794
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:38,669
It would have been better if we had all stayed here
together with our weapons and ammunition.

795
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,880
Thirty Mausers
and a machine gun will be enough.

796
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:44,716
As long as you and I are here,
no one will enter San Miguel.

797
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:46,760
I know, I know.

798
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:50,430
General Elías needs weapons
more than we do.

799
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:57,896
Who knows if the general
will ever get those weapons?

800
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,358
Why?

801
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:07,406
I don't know if the nino and those
good-for-nothings will find the way.

802
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:10,075
Didn't you tell them how to get there?

803
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:15,288
I said up the mountains, in the Sierra.

804
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,165
What else could I say?

805
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,459
There are no paths, nothing.

806
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:22,087
- The General is waiting for those weapons.
- I know.

807
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,675
I know that.

808
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,597
Watch it! I'll kill you!

809
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:36,518
Look...

810
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:39,604
if it weren't for the army,
which could get here any second,

811
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:43,483
I'd go after them,

812
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:48,196
catch them and bring them back with me.

813
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:50,198
I could, right?

814
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:52,784
But we need you here.

815
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,541
Yes, I know.

816
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,043
Chuncho!

817
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,919
They stole it!

818
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:05,881
- They stole the machine gun!
- When? Who?

819
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:09,718
- This morning, when they left.
- They asked for it in your name.

820
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,720
In my name? Who?

821
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:14,139
I don't know his name.
The one who sings.

822
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,141
- Picaro?
- Yes.

823
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,562
Did you hear that?

824
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,317
And you're the one who knows
how to read and write?

825
01:13:27,195 --> 01:13:30,238
Hermano, I'm going.

826
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:33,116
- A horse!
- Chuncho!

827
01:13:33,201 --> 01:13:37,079
Give me your hat. !Vamos!

828
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:39,331
Come back soon, brother!

829
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:45,295
- Come back soon.
- !Tranquilo!

830
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:48,423
I'll be back with the machine gun tomorrow!

831
01:13:57,517 --> 01:13:59,684
Hurry.

832
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:25,043
It's Chuncho!

833
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,780
Picaro!

834
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,882
Eufemio!

835
01:16:04,352 --> 01:16:06,311
Get my horse.

836
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:18,907
Get off!

837
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:22,661
No one can steal a machine gun
in my name! Is that clear?

838
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,172
All right. Should we go?

839
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:48,561
Not that way! This way!

840
01:16:57,738 --> 01:16:58,571
Why?

841
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:00,949
Because you can't go
to General Elías's headquarters.

842
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:02,951
It's too dangerous.
There's fighting there.

843
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:07,539
There's a different place where Elías's men
bring us our money. We'll go there.

844
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,541
Didn't you want to see the general?

845
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:13,253
Of course I'd like to.

846
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:15,255
But, for now...

847
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,717
I'll be satisfied with his photograph.

848
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:21,219
Some other time,
some other time.

849
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:26,641
Adelita, guapa, let's go!

850
01:17:26,726 --> 01:17:29,060
Let's go, horse!

851
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:56,629
General Elías's men!

852
01:17:56,714 --> 01:18:00,008
Chuncho!
How come there is only one?

853
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:03,136
I told you they'd come.

854
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,180
- But only one?
- There are the others.

855
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:08,058
- No, they're soldiers!
- Pepito!

856
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:13,229
- Rurales!
- Pepito!

857
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:17,067
- Where are the others?
- There, at the watering hole.

858
01:18:24,617 --> 01:18:28,495
- What's going on?
- Rurales!

859
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:34,292
- We're screwed.
- Get us more ammunition.

860
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,170
Go, Vicente!

861
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:39,672
Nino, the machine gun!

862
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:09,452
Take cover! Quick!

863
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,250
Hurry!

864
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:29,722
- News of the general?
- Everything's fine.

865
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:31,266
- Did you bring the weapons?
- Of course.

866
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:34,644
- But where are the others?
- They were captured.

867
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:37,272
Now we'll have some fun.
Grab a Mauser.

868
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:46,865
Vicente has been hit.

869
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,994
- Fire, nino.
- Easy.

870
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:52,912
What are you waiting for?
Come on!

871
01:19:52,997 --> 01:19:56,207
Come on, damn it! Shoot!

872
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,554
Listen to the machine gun sing!

873
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:13,391
Come on, nino! Another one.

874
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:20,607
Another!

875
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:23,776
They're coming back.

876
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:30,533
Watch out for Adelita, nino.

877
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,751
Another one.

878
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,305
Pepito, more ammunition. Quick!

879
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:08,530
Pepito...

880
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,532
What have you done?

881
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,621
What have you done, you idiot?

882
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,387
Come here, sons of bitches!

883
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,598
!Cabrón!
Come here!

884
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:46,150
Wait, nino. Stop.

885
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:50,154
I'll take care of those guys.

886
01:21:57,705 --> 01:21:59,539
Where are you going?

887
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,836
Come here! I have to shoot you!

888
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,674
Good thing you had the machine gun.

889
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:20,351
Come here.

890
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:27,525
Don't leave!

891
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:07,273
Is he dead?

892
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,370
Maybe he didn't have it.

893
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:25,416
Maybe one of the others was carrying it.

894
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,131
But why them?

895
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:36,177
Fuck!

896
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:39,347
That means he didn't bring the money.

897
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:43,601
Or did you take it, nino?

898
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:47,355
- Yeah, and I already spent it all.
- Yeah, yeah.

899
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:50,066
Now we have to go to the general's camp.

900
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:53,194
And Vicente is dead.

901
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:57,448
- Eufemio?
- Dead.

902
01:23:58,283 --> 01:23:59,909
Pepito?

903
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:08,459
Dead.

904
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,301
Adelita, buck up.

905
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:21,806
- Buck up, muchacha.
- I'm leaving.

906
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:25,643
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

907
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:27,937
Muchacha.

908
01:24:28,814 --> 01:24:31,607
In this life, people die sometimes.

909
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:36,487
What about your share of the weapons?

910
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:38,823
Did you get the money?

911
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,576
No, nothing here.

912
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:45,663
But if you come to the camp with us...

913
01:24:46,874 --> 01:24:49,834
we'll split the money three ways.

914
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:54,005
Do you have any money?

915
01:25:05,184 --> 01:25:07,059
I don't know what you're looking for.

916
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:11,731
I've never understood you,
and I don't even care anymore.

917
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:23,785
Pepito is down there.
Bury him.

918
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:49,644
Are we going to waste more time
burying them?

919
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:38,276
What's wrong, nino?

920
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:41,779
Do you feel sick?

921
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:59,964
Come here.

922
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,471
Let's go.

923
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:28,492
It's nothing, nino.
You're not used to this life.

924
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:35,249
Now...

925
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:39,045
with a little fire,
everything will be all right.

926
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:43,883
No, it's malaria.

927
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,136
Malaria?

928
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:51,724
Get my pills from my bag.

929
01:27:56,521 --> 01:28:00,775
- Get what from your bag?
- The vial with the quinine.

930
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:07,448
The vial with the quinine.

931
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:02,753
It's a little glass vial.

932
01:29:04,965 --> 01:29:07,425
Glass? Okay.

933
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:19,562
- The whole thing?
- Four.

934
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,480
Four.

935
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:26,235
Take this.

936
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:29,071
Take it.

937
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:33,826
This is no good. I'll give you
some good medicine, nino.

938
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:38,539
Chew this. It's good.

939
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:44,837
Mescal is good for the body,
for the head and for love, nino.

940
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:48,758
It helps you sleep, dream.

941
01:30:28,298 --> 01:30:30,591
- Drink up, nino.
- Thank you.

942
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:32,551
- Chuncho.
- What?

943
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:34,261
I don't understand you.

944
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:37,515
You keep wasting time,
thinking of others.

945
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:40,267
- Me? Who do I think of?
- Me, for instance.

946
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:44,980
You could have left on your own
and taken all the money for yourself.

947
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:50,945
Well, I don't like to work alone.

948
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:02,248
- Chuncho.
- What?

949
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:06,418
Do you know a Hotel Morelos
in Ciudad Juárez?

950
01:31:06,503 --> 01:31:08,546
I don't know any hotels.

951
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:11,215
If we get separated, find it.

952
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:16,178
- Why should we get separated?
- Something might happen.

953
01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:19,849
Nothing ever happens, amigo.

954
01:31:21,852 --> 01:31:26,230
Nino, why do you have
a gold bullet in your bag?

955
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:35,573
It's... a good-luck charm.

956
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:45,207
- Like this is for me?
- Right.

957
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:47,293
Good luck!

958
01:31:50,672 --> 01:31:53,257
Let's go.

959
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,968
The general's camp is nearby.

960
01:31:58,054 --> 01:31:59,555
Just think, nino.

961
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:03,934
That money is all ours.
We'll divide it all between us.

962
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:06,061
!Vamos!

963
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,820
LAN D AND LI BERTY

964
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:19,533
- Chuncho, are you still alive?
- Chuncho can never die.

965
01:32:19,618 --> 01:32:22,620
- How are things here?
- We're waiting for weapons.

966
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:25,206
- How about down there?
- It's hell.

967
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:27,041
Vamos.

968
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:30,127
- Too hot?
- Hot and bloody.

969
01:32:30,212 --> 01:32:32,504
This here is heaven.

970
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:34,590
A heaven where we starve.

971
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,636
- Not enough to eat?
- Nothing at all.

972
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:44,225
I have a machine gun for the general.

973
01:32:52,776 --> 01:32:55,277
- Go on, eat it.
- Thank you!

974
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:14,380
Hombre, he's a friend of mine.

975
01:33:19,135 --> 01:33:20,844
Let's go!

976
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:28,560
Adios, senor.

977
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:45,995
Hey, kids, who's the oldest?

978
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:50,541
Come here.

979
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:07,433
Divide it fairly.
One chunk apiece.

980
01:34:11,521 --> 01:34:13,647
Come forward.

981
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:18,736
- Two.
- Two.

982
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:23,324
Hold it.

983
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:26,535
How many?

984
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:28,746
- Five.
- Five?

985
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:31,415
- Three.
- Three.

986
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:33,417
Catch.

987
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:38,005
Paquita.

988
01:34:40,133 --> 01:34:41,967
Catch.

989
01:34:43,345 --> 01:34:45,220
Good, Paquita.

990
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:46,847
Another one.

991
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:25,761
Stop.

992
01:35:27,013 --> 01:35:31,975
- Senor, now do you like Mexico?
- No.

993
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:35,896
So what are you doing here?
Why don't you go back to your country?

994
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:39,316
I sell weapons.
It's a job like any other.

995
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:43,070
I wouldn't sell weapons to people I disliked.

996
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:46,990
Because you're not a professional.
Chico, learn from General Elías.

997
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:50,702
He buys my weapons and doesn't complain.

998
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:55,541
- Good-bye, revolutionary.
- Adios.

999
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:25,863
- How many survivors in the town?
- Not many.

1000
01:36:26,489 --> 01:36:29,992
- Are they here?
- Yes, we put them in the chapel.

1001
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:32,369
- Are there many dead?
- Yes, many.

1002
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:34,913
Hombre.

1003
01:36:34,998 --> 01:36:36,498
Senor.

1004
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:40,377
A machine gun.

1005
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,301
Look.

1006
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:52,139
It's fantastic.
The latest model.

1007
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:55,726
It uses the same bullets as the Mauser.

1008
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:59,229
One...

1009
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:06,028
machine gun.

1010
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,953
Go on. Out.

1011
01:37:23,922 --> 01:37:27,341
One, two, two.

1012
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:32,763
That's it.

1013
01:37:35,642 --> 01:37:37,434
How much?

1014
01:37:37,519 --> 01:37:39,728
- How much what?
- The amount.

1015
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:48,362
Five thousand pesos.

1016
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:52,407
Good.

1017
01:37:52,492 --> 01:37:56,119
First, the general wants to see you.

1018
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:57,788
The general?

1019
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:01,208
To see me?

1020
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:02,793
Great.

1021
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:32,823
They resisted as long as they could,
but there were too many soldiers.

1022
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:35,909
- Nothing could be done.
- General.

1023
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:39,830
Here he is.

1024
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:56,471
Come forward.

1025
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:05,772
- Come, Chuncho.
- Well met, General.

1026
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:11,069
I have a picture of you.
It's your spitting image.

1027
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:12,946
Take a seat.

1028
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:18,118
Move.

1029
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:22,205
It's been a long time
since you fought with us.

1030
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,460
Now we must talk about money.

1031
01:39:26,544 --> 01:39:28,295
And about the weapons I brought.

1032
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:31,173
Did you hear about the machine gun?
It's amazing.

1033
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:34,176
Yes, I know.

1034
01:39:35,428 --> 01:39:38,347
- What's the total, Tomás?
- Five thousand pesos.

1035
01:39:39,349 --> 01:39:41,892
- Five thousand pesos.
- Pay him.

1036
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:48,440
This time, Chuncho...

1037
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:54,821
has done well for himself.

1038
01:40:07,251 --> 01:40:10,295
- Thank you, General.
- Just a minute, Chuncho.

1039
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:12,881
I need your advice.

1040
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:17,594
- Mine?
- Yours.

1041
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:18,762
Sit down.

1042
01:40:24,936 --> 01:40:29,940
Three days ago, Carranza's army
took back the town of San Miguel.

1043
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:32,401
All the townspeople died,

1044
01:40:32,485 --> 01:40:34,945
because they had no weapons
to defend themselves.

1045
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:43,620
It was a massacre.

1046
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:47,124
- Really?
- Yes.

1047
01:40:49,168 --> 01:40:52,129
One man profited from this massacre.

1048
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:55,632
A man who profits
from the deaths of his brothers...

1049
01:40:56,092 --> 01:40:57,759
Does he seem like a man to you?

1050
01:41:03,141 --> 01:41:04,850
What would you call him?

1051
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:09,146
A bastard.

1052
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:12,149
And what would you do to him?

1053
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:18,864
I would kill him.

1054
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:26,913
Your comrades from San Miguel
are dead, all of them.

1055
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:31,877
And you've made 5,000 pesos.

1056
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,813
Have me shot.

1057
01:41:54,984 --> 01:41:56,777
- Ramirez.
- Yes, General?

1058
01:41:56,861 --> 01:41:59,696
No, I must punish him.

1059
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:04,493
He's my brother.

1060
01:42:06,078 --> 01:42:07,162
My blood.

1061
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:11,875
And you?

1062
01:42:13,753 --> 01:42:15,712
What do you have to say about it?

1063
01:42:18,549 --> 01:42:21,051
What can I say, General?

1064
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:23,887
Who knows?

1065
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:30,352
Maybe death will be less ugly
if my brother shoots me.

1066
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:35,690
Here, cashier.
I don't need any money where I'm going.

1067
01:42:35,775 --> 01:42:37,901
Good-bye, Chuncho.

1068
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:41,738
Good-bye, General.
Long live Mexico!

1069
01:43:18,484 --> 01:43:20,527
Good-bye, beautiful.
I'm leaving!

1070
01:43:36,294 --> 01:43:40,547
I don't like this spot, brother.
It stinks of pig shit.

1071
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:43,049
Let's go a little further.

1072
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:54,728
Hermano, Santo, won't you let me
make confession or absolve me?

1073
01:43:54,812 --> 01:43:57,272
There is no absolution for what you did.

1074
01:43:57,356 --> 01:44:02,110
- Prepare yourself.
- But you said God is good and generous.

1075
01:44:02,194 --> 01:44:04,446
God is, but I'm not.

1076
01:44:08,075 --> 01:44:10,493
Where, then?
Will you make up your mind?

1077
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:14,623
Wherever the hat falls.

1078
01:44:19,045 --> 01:44:20,587
Where are you aiming?

1079
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:23,924
Here or here?

1080
01:44:24,008 --> 01:44:27,344
- Wherever you want.
- Here.

1081
01:44:37,146 --> 01:44:40,231
Brother, what is it?

1082
01:44:43,361 --> 01:44:45,946
They shot General Elías!

1083
01:45:15,267 --> 01:45:18,728
The general was shot with a golden bullet.

1084
01:45:27,989 --> 01:45:30,907
General Elías is dead.

1085
01:45:46,465 --> 01:45:50,260
REBEL GENERAL" KILLED
BY GOLDEN BULLET

1086
01:46:06,277 --> 01:46:08,903
No bills, please.

1087
01:46:08,988 --> 01:46:12,198
- Isn't it the same?
- No. Gold!

1088
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:16,327
You promised me
100,000 pesos in gold.

1089
01:46:16,412 --> 01:46:18,079
Pay him.

1090
01:46:50,946 --> 01:46:54,324
It's hard to believe you succeeded.

1091
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:55,658
Why?

1092
01:46:57,495 --> 01:46:59,120
You're very young.

1093
01:46:59,747 --> 01:47:02,832
They said the same thing when I volunteered.

1094
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:08,171
And yet I've done what I said I'd do.

1095
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:11,341
- But how did you get away?
- I was lucky.

1096
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:16,513
Just a moment.

1097
01:47:17,389 --> 01:47:19,390
The receipt.

1098
01:47:24,230 --> 01:47:27,524
For important services
rendered to the government.

1099
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:48,002
Senor Tate, there are other rebel leaders.

1100
01:47:49,088 --> 01:47:53,591
If we should need you,
where can we find you?

1101
01:47:53,676 --> 01:47:56,219
If I need money, I'll find you.

1102
01:47:56,303 --> 01:47:57,929
Adios.

1103
01:48:18,409 --> 01:48:20,368
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, senor.

1104
01:48:20,452 --> 01:48:22,120
Thank you very much.

1105
01:48:24,123 --> 01:48:27,000
Senor, can you spare some change?

1106
01:48:27,084 --> 01:48:28,543
I'm hungry.

1107
01:48:28,627 --> 01:48:31,588
Get out of here, for the last time!

1108
01:48:31,672 --> 01:48:34,090
What do you want? Get out!

1109
01:48:34,633 --> 01:48:37,552
Stop bothering our clients!

1110
01:48:45,477 --> 01:48:47,520
Where are you going?
Stop!

1111
01:48:47,605 --> 01:48:50,064
What do you want?
Watch out! He has a gun!

1112
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:51,941
Stop him!

1113
01:48:52,026 --> 01:48:53,610
Call the police!

1114
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:56,905
Leave him alone.
Leave him.

1115
01:48:56,989 --> 01:48:59,199
He's armed.
Can't you see he's got a gun?

1116
01:48:59,283 --> 01:49:02,452
He's a friend of mine.

1117
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:15,256
It's just a joke.
It's not loaded.

1118
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:20,553
How are you?
I've been expecting you.

1119
01:49:20,638 --> 01:49:23,973
- Shouldn't we hand him over to the police?
- Go away!

1120
01:49:27,019 --> 01:49:28,019
Here.

1121
01:49:30,898 --> 01:49:32,982
Don't shoot right away.
Wait five minutes.

1122
01:49:33,859 --> 01:49:37,946
Manager, I gave you a case yesterday.
I'd like to collect it now.

1123
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:39,322
Very well.

1124
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:42,450
Of course, senor Tate.

1125
01:49:42,534 --> 01:49:44,327
Just a moment.

1126
01:49:45,537 --> 01:49:47,914
- Right away?
- Yes.

1127
01:49:47,998 --> 01:49:51,960
To be secure, I put it in the safe.

1128
01:49:52,044 --> 01:49:54,754
Here it is.
The case and a letter.

1129
01:49:56,632 --> 01:49:58,967
For senor Chuncho Munos.

1130
01:49:59,051 --> 01:50:01,177
Read the letter.

1131
01:50:09,144 --> 01:50:12,355
Dear Chuncho, I waited for you
for a week, but now I must leave.

1132
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:14,565
I'm leaving you the 50,000 pesos you earned.

1133
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:17,110
It's half of what I made with your help.

1134
01:50:17,194 --> 01:50:19,237
I hope we meet again someday.

1135
01:50:19,321 --> 01:50:21,447
Thank you for everything, and-"

1136
01:50:26,036 --> 01:50:27,745
For you.

1137
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:32,208
Senor, just a moment.

1138
01:50:32,793 --> 01:50:34,419
A signature, please.

1139
01:50:34,503 --> 01:50:36,212
Come.

1140
01:50:46,015 --> 01:50:49,309
Sign the paper.
Any mark will do.

1141
01:50:57,735 --> 01:50:59,152
Good.

1142
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:03,906
Come. Let's go up to my room.

1143
01:51:08,495 --> 01:51:12,707
- Should we call the police?
- No, I think they're friends.

1144
01:51:19,089 --> 01:51:22,008
- It's another one of your tricks.
- No.

1145
01:51:22,092 --> 01:51:25,345
If I'd wanted to trick you,
I would have left with all the money.

1146
01:51:25,429 --> 01:51:26,929
That's true.

1147
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:31,434
But the general...

1148
01:51:33,354 --> 01:51:34,937
Why did you kill him, nino?

1149
01:51:37,649 --> 01:51:40,651
Yes, of course, I know.

1150
01:51:40,736 --> 01:51:42,945
For all this money!

1151
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:46,699
You see how much that man was worth?

1152
01:51:46,784 --> 01:51:50,620
You've made more with this one job
than you could have in your entire lifetime.

1153
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:53,414
For sure.

1154
01:51:58,587 --> 01:52:01,798
- But why did you kill my brother?
- He was about to kill you.

1155
01:52:03,133 --> 01:52:04,717
Yes.

1156
01:52:05,219 --> 01:52:06,719
That's true.

1157
01:52:09,973 --> 01:52:12,308
Well, what's the matter?

1158
01:52:15,771 --> 01:52:19,399
- What's wrong, Chuncho?
- I don't know.

1159
01:52:20,901 --> 01:52:22,985
I came here to kill you.

1160
01:52:23,487 --> 01:52:25,321
And now I don't know.

1161
01:52:26,323 --> 01:52:27,323
?Quién sabe?

1162
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:29,909
Scruples?

1163
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:31,536
All right. Let's do this.

1164
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:35,289
If you're having scruples,
I'll take all the money.

1165
01:52:35,374 --> 01:52:37,333
Hands off!

1166
01:52:38,001 --> 01:52:40,503
Who took you to the general? I did!

1167
01:52:43,549 --> 01:52:46,300
Yes, with this money,

1168
01:52:46,385 --> 01:52:51,639
I'd be a rich man,
even in the United States.

1169
01:52:54,435 --> 01:52:57,103
You are a rich man, Chuncho.

1170
01:52:57,187 --> 01:52:59,939
It's time to start looking like one.

1171
01:53:15,873 --> 01:53:16,873
Relax, senor.

1172
01:53:33,515 --> 01:53:35,600
What is your profession?

1173
01:53:35,684 --> 01:53:38,853
I'm in business.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

1174
01:53:39,771 --> 01:53:42,064
For the United States.

1175
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:45,151
If I come back, I'll look for you.

1176
01:53:45,235 --> 01:53:47,028
I like you very much.

1177
01:53:52,075 --> 01:53:55,578
- How did it go last night?
- Very well. A fiery woman.

1178
01:54:01,919 --> 01:54:05,213
- How much did you give her?
- Nothing. I've never paid!

1179
01:54:05,797 --> 01:54:09,133
- What do you do to women, Chuncho?
- They fall in love.

1180
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:14,597
Sometimes I might give them
a little present, if I feel like it.

1181
01:54:15,182 --> 01:54:18,768
But when you pay,
there are no complications.

1182
01:54:19,269 --> 01:54:21,604
In your country, perhaps.
I don't know.

1183
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:25,358
But here money doesn't fix everything.

1184
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:31,531
Hey, beautiful!

1185
01:54:32,157 --> 01:54:33,783
- Get out of the way.
- It was my turn.

1186
01:54:33,867 --> 01:54:35,785
And now it's mine.

1187
01:54:35,869 --> 01:54:39,372
Life is beautiful
because it's full of surprises.

1188
01:54:46,713 --> 01:54:48,506
The last man goes first.

1189
01:54:49,841 --> 01:54:51,592
Senor.

1190
01:54:51,677 --> 01:54:54,303
Senor, may I shine your shoes?

1191
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:04,564
Buy yourself some bread.

1192
01:55:08,443 --> 01:55:10,152
Cut it out!

1193
01:55:12,781 --> 01:55:14,615
Buy yourself some bread.

1194
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:16,200
Shall we go?

1195
01:55:16,827 --> 01:55:18,869
Thank you, senor.

1196
01:55:23,917 --> 01:55:26,627
Tell me, Chuncho.
Have you ever taken a train before?

1197
01:55:26,712 --> 01:55:29,255
Thirteen, or 11.
I've lost count.

1198
01:55:29,339 --> 01:55:32,800
- No, I mean as a passenger.
- As a passenger, none.

1199
01:55:32,884 --> 01:55:35,177
You'll see, it's much nicer.

1200
01:55:35,887 --> 01:55:39,265
Nino, if we go to the United States,
won't it be dangerous for you?

1201
01:55:39,349 --> 01:55:41,392
You said there's a bounty on your head.

1202
01:55:41,476 --> 01:55:45,980
That was just a trick
so you'd let me join your gang.

1203
01:55:48,275 --> 01:55:50,234
What about the handcuffs?

1204
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:52,778
I took them off a dead soldier.

1205
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:57,783
- How did you know I'd attack the train?
- I had to join the rebels to get to the general.

1206
01:55:57,868 --> 01:56:01,120
I'd been riding trains
with weapons cargoes for two weeks.

1207
01:56:01,204 --> 01:56:04,081
- Then you met me.
- That's right.

1208
01:56:04,166 --> 01:56:07,460
Nino, you're very clever.
You never make a mistake, right?

1209
01:56:07,544 --> 01:56:10,338
- Let's get on. The train's leaving.
- You've been a good friend to me.

1210
01:56:10,422 --> 01:56:12,923
It's true, but I have to kill you.

1211
01:56:13,008 --> 01:56:17,094
- Are you starting with that again?
- No, nino, I'm almost finished.

1212
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:19,847
Don't be stupid.
I made you rich, Chuncho.

1213
01:56:19,931 --> 01:56:22,892
- Why do you want to kill me?
- Nada. I just have to do it.

1214
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:25,353
- But tell me why!
- ?Quién sabe?

1215
01:56:25,437 --> 01:56:27,521
Why do you want to kill me?

1216
01:56:28,482 --> 01:56:29,732
?Quién sabe?

1217
01:56:29,816 --> 01:56:32,234
What do you mean, who knows"?
You have to know.

1218
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:34,278
I do know why.

1219
01:56:35,364 --> 01:56:37,031
Wait. Tell me why!

1220
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:52,797
Go back to the United States!

1221
01:56:58,178 --> 01:57:01,013
And you, don't buy bread
with this money.

1222
01:57:01,098 --> 01:57:04,100
!Hombre!
