00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,752
<i>I've just found out I've got a lifer</i>
<i>out on licence this morning.</i>

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,398
<i>Ruth Slater.</i>

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,948
- How long's she been in for?
- 15 years.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,190
She was 17 when she went inside.

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,033
Two and a half in Durham,
ten years at New Hall,

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,588
and the last two and a half
at Askham Grange,

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,671
where she's done very well
as far as I know,

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,389
very different person from the one
that got hauled up to Durham 15 years ago.

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,193
- See you, Ruth.
- See you.

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,271
- Ta-ra.
- All that remains, Ruth,

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,271
is for you to sign the Firearms Act.

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,593
Good luck, Ruth.
Look after yourself.

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,952
Thanks... for everything
what you done for me.

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,432
Hell of a thing, going in that young.
She won't know her arse from her elbow.

16
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,910
She's been on day release for the past
12 months, working in a garden centre,

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,037
so she won't be
completely wet behind the ears.

18
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,350
I'll find out what she went in for eventually.

19
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,237
She murdered two policemen.

20
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,031
Shot 'em -
one in the face, one in the chest.

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,908
One near 50, not far off retirement,
and the other one a rookie lad.

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,234
Hiya.

23
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,470
Another four months, it'll be my turn.

24
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,632
Look after yourself, mate.

25
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,472
You too.

26
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,750
Oh, do you believe this?
This is a brand-new car!

27
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,557
Excellent! Wonderful! Fantastic!

28
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,716
- Guess what?
- Oh, not again!

29
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,358
I should've bought a nearly new one.

30
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,431
Why didn't I? Why didn't I do that?

31
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,432
You're gonna have to ring the garage, love.
Ring the RAC.

32
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,114
Thank you, yes, funnily enough,
I had worked that one out.

33
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,270
D'you mind if I shoot off?
I've got a nine o'clock.

34
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,829
- And if I'm dropping these two off...
- No, you go.

35
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,037
Bugger off, don't mind me.
I'll sort meself out.

36
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,872
Have a good day.

37
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,958
Come on, come on.

38
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,156
Has she not been offered any sort of
new identity or anything?

39
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,639
What, with our resources?

40
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,358
Oh!

41
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,631
- I thought it was Lucy's writing.
- Well, I'm sure she's thinking about you.

42
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,312
You know she doesn't do cards.

43
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,152
I've got butterflies.

44
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,550
Good. It's a big thing
starting your A level course.

45
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,758
It's a milestone. It's an achievement
just getting this far.

46
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,833
In fact, it's probably
the most important thing you'll ever do...

47
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,393
because it determines the rest of your life,
it determines which university you'll go to.

48
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,552
I still have nightmares
about sitting my A levels.

49
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,868
I do!

50
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,520
I'm sitting in the exam room,
I'm at my desk,

51
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,355
I turn over the exam paper but I suddenly
realise I haven't done any revision.

52
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,149
So I think
you're allowed to have butterflies.

53
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,515
I think we'd be worried if you didn't.

54
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,911
Mr Belcombe?

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,514
- Hello.
- Are you the father of Lucy Belcombe?

56
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,352
Why? Yes. Why?

57
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,670
Is she a student at college in York?

58
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,439
She appears to be involved
in an accident, sir.

59
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,434
Lucy? What kind?
What do you mean, she appears to?

60
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,114
She's been taken to the City Hospital.

61
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,599
She isn't?

62
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,113
That's as much as we know.

63
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,673
Ah...
I've gotta phone my wife.

64
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,236
Hello, hi,
I've come to see Carol Crossland.

65
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,753
What's your name?

66
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,193
Ruth Slater.

67
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,959
- Hello.
- <i>I have a Ruth Slater here for you.</i>

68
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,313
Right, thanks.

69
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,755
D'you wanna take a seat for me, love?

70
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,556
- Ruth Slater?
- Yeah. Oh, sorry.

71
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,394
Oh, sorry. Hi, how do you do?
I'm Carol Crossland, I'm your new...

72
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,232
Have they explained to you about Alison?

73
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,278
Yeah, dropped dead, heart attack.
Kept telling her she were too fat.

74
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,998
Not that bluntly, though, obviously.

75
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,433
D'you want to come upstairs?

76
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,669
- Have you not?
- What?

77
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,320
- Dropped your stuff off.
- They said to come straight here.

78
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,753
- You didn't have to.
- What?

79
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,229
- D'you want me to go and come back?
- No, of course not.

80
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,833
Erm, I tell you what,

81
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,993
I'll drive you to your flat. I'd like to see it
anyway. Give it the once-over.

82
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,389
Give me two minutes,
I'll get me car keys.

83
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,948
- How was your journey?
- Yeah, it were fine.

84
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,749
When t'train stopped. I were worried
it weren't gonna, in right place, anyway.

85
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,229
I've never been on a train before.

86
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,313
Love you.

87
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,553
Da-da.

88
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,354
The train. Yes.

89
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,034
Here we go, here we go. Ooh!

90
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,151
- Hi.
- Hiya.

91
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,876
And you've been working
in a garden centre?

92
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,313
No, bathroom suppliers.

93
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,836
You'll have to bear with me, I'm trying to
get up to speed with the information.

94
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,480
- Straight down.
- Yeah, I were driving a forklift truck.

95
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,437
It were good. I like driving.

96
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,069
First time I'd been behind the wheel
in 14 years. Didn't know I were born.

97
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,515
Don't you need
an ordinary licence for that?

98
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,033
Yeah.

99
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,317
You must've passed your test
pretty sharpish after you were 17, then.

100
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,753
I did, yeah.

101
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,877
Still, I were driving
since I were eight or nine.

102
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,393
Other people's cars?

103
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,913
Mainly.

104
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,434
- Then before that I worked for t'nuns.
- Oh, yeah.

105
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,431
Yeah, first time on day release.

106
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,398
Once a week they'd send me
to this convent in York,

107
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,914
cos they had a shop there
for t'tourists, you know,

108
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,230
selling knocked off bits of cross.

109
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,958
Not really.

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,558
They were funny.

111
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,313
They were so...

112
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,473
What?

113
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,073
Sweet.

114
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,071
Kind.

115
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,559
Just uncomplicated.

116
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,355
I wouldn't mind being a nun.

117
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,678
You don't look like a nun.

118
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,479
Don't I?

119
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,516
What do I look like?

120
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,357
A forklift truck driver.

121
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,071
So you've got a job lined up over here,
and you start that when?

122
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,513
Tomorrow.

123
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,399
Where?

124
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,598
Jaggers, it's a meat processing place,
it's on Gibbet Street.

125
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,636
Good.

126
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,950
I wouldn't say that,
but the money's not too bad.

127
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,229
Steve's had a phone call
from this bloke at the probation office.

128
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,799
Has he?

129
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,355
I was wondering...
if you could talk to him.

130
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,759
Why me?

131
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,473
You're his brother.

132
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,433
You're his wife.

133
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,190
He's thinking things.

134
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,475
Things that are gonna get him
into bother.

135
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,949
Would it bother you if they did?

136
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,316
I just don't want him to go to prison.

137
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,592
I'll try and catch up with him.

138
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,593
Will you?

139
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,753
When?

140
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,353
Soon.

141
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,593
When?

142
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,159
I just said.

143
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,153
Mr and Mrs Belcombe?

144
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,993
- Mm.
- I'm DC Summergate, CID.

145
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,433
Can I talk to you?

146
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,590
Yes, of course.

147
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,473
All the witness statements indicate that
she went through a red light at speed,

148
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,394
- and then impacted with...
- I'm sorry, she went through a red light?

149
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,675
Your daughter was driving the vehicle.

150
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,637
She was the only person in it.

151
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,392
But she hasn't...

152
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,113
She hasn't passed her test.

153
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,952
We know.

154
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,951
Well, whose car was it?

155
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,350
It belongs to a Jonathan Litchford.
D'you know him?

156
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,356
No. Is he a student?

157
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,159
No, he's a drug dealer.

158
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,597
- The point is...
- No, no, no!

159
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,878
Lucy wouldn't mix with someone like that.
She has a rebellious streak...

160
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,679
She's an unusually gifted musician,
she's a real talent.

161
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,478
There's no way she'd throw all that away.

162
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,030
I'm just telling you the facts
as they appear to be at the moment.

163
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,190
The point is,
we've had to take a blood sample.

164
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,554
Why?

165
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,791
So we can ascertain whether or not
she had any substances in her system

166
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,632
when the incident occurred.

167
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,192
You did well getting this place.

168
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,077
I were on t'housing list for two years.

169
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,958
- Good for you.
- Last week, I took a day off work,

170
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,713
borrowed a van off someone at prison,

171
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,360
sorted myself out a bit of furniture.

172
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,192
Well, you seem very sorted.

173
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,589
Yeah, well, I've had a lot of help.

174
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,319
It won't be easy, first few weeks,

175
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,437
specially wi' you being on your own
and no family, but...

176
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,954
Who said I've got no family?

177
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,237
That's what I understood,
but, like I say, I'm still not up to speed.

178
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,312
- I've got a sister.
- Yeah, yeah, I did read that...

179
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,879
I meant apart from...

180
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,475
I was meaning people you could rely on
during the first few weeks and months.

181
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,437
I'm sorry,
I've put me foot in it, haven't I?

182
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,830
No, when I got arrested,
and when I got sent down...

183
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,673
I don't know how much you know
and how much you don't know.

184
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,274
Just assume that I know nothing.

185
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,158
Katie was six, I was 17.

186
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,708
I were on remand
and she got put into care.

187
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,116
And I wrote to her every day -
well, as often as they'd let me.

188
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,431
She struggled to read it, but I thought
someone might've helped her.

189
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,637
I sent it all via social services.

190
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,349
I didn't expect owt back,
cos she were only six or seven,

191
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,356
but... after I got sent down,
they sent me to Durham,

192
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,195
and, er, well, I couldn't find
anything out about her.

193
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,713
I kept asking people.

194
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,038
Eventually,
I found out she'd been adopted.

195
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,395
I didn't know who by
or where she were or owt.

196
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,948
I would've liked a photo or summat,

197
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,429
you know, so I could've seen
what she looked like, but...

198
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,952
And then just before I moved
to Askham...

199
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,070
...it were coming up to her 18th,

200
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,037
and I thought, well, this is it.

201
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,079
If there's somebody been stopping her
somehow from knowing where I were,

202
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,515
or how to contact me,
well, it wouldn't matter no more,

203
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,830
cos she'd be old enough now to...

204
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,353
But there were nothing.

205
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,836
And week after week I were phoning
the social services at Halifax,

206
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,275
and I were saying,
"She's me sister and she's 18,

207
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,715
"can't you just tell her
I want to see her?

208
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,555
"And if she don't wanna see me, fine.
I mean, it's fine."

209
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,995
And they wouldn't even do that.

210
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,549
So I don't know.

211
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,112
D'you want some tea?

212
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,673
Sure.

213
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,676
So how often will you need to see me?

214
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,399
Once a week as a rule to start with.

215
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,313
So there's just your licence conditions
to go through.

216
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,753
Condition.

217
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,798
We need to be clear between us
that you know what that condition is.

218
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,632
I haven't to make any contact

219
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,429
with any members of the families
of either of... me victims.

220
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,191
So what d'you know?

221
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,430
Did you get a phone call last week?

222
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,038
Yeah.

223
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,237
Well, how do you feel about that, then?

224
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,954
D'you remember, after it happened,
what we used to say?

225
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,069
We were kids.

226
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,233
So what? 15 years for a man's life -
it's nothing. It's not enough.

227
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,199
Look at us.

228
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,236
Look at me, bloody greetings cards,

229
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,356
and look at you -

230
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,719
mucking out council flats all day
after the dirty little bastards have left.

231
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,394
We could've done more, both of us.

232
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,992
It's true.

233
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,119
So what if it is?

234
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,037
I've got a wife, I've got a baby.

235
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,193
Don't tell me you wouldn't want to spend
ten minutes in the same room with her,

236
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,350
just you and me
and a couple of baseball bats?

237
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,679
Tell you what...

238
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,754
...if you find the bitch, which you won't,
you'll keep it to yourself.

239
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,513
OK?

240
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,877
A poltergeist?

241
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,430
That's what everybody in the office thought.
It's a possibility!

242
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,669
We're haunted?

243
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,718
You can take the mickey,
but it does add up.

244
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,395
All sorts of things I keep remembering -
not just the way the car won't start.

245
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,311
Like the thing with the light bulb.

246
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,516
- What thing?
- It just popped out.

247
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,070
You were here - from that lamp,
five feet in the air, hit the ceiling.

248
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,832
- Really?
- That was odd.

249
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,435
- And what about my sister? She says...
- She's enough to frighten anybody.

250
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,796
She says she won't come and stop again
after last time. Do you remember?

251
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,474
Cameron cried all night
and there was no reason for it.

252
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,993
Mum, babies cry.

253
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,672
Yes, but not for nothing.

254
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,118
I don't know, maybe they're more sensitive
to these things than grown-ups are.

255
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,031
Have you ever felt creepy here?

256
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,351
I suppose, if I'm here by myself,
which I hardly ever am,

257
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,032
there's a certain...

258
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,594
And have you ever noticed
going through to the pantry,

259
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,558
how just as you go through the doorway,
the temperature drops?

260
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,076
- That's because there's a draught.
- Yes, but where does it come from?

261
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,639
D'you think someone died here?

262
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,917
The place is over 400 years old,
it'd be odd if someone hadn't died here.

263
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,117
Yeah, but like in funny circumstances
or something.

264
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,998
Oh, you're just going
to frighten yourselves.

265
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,513
I'm not frightened,

266
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,354
I just want to know
if there's some... spirit thing here,

267
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,069
that's wanting to be,
you know, released.

268
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,552
All right, come on...

269
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,595
You explain how does this get
from here to here with that kind of force.

270
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,433
It smashed the door!
How thick is that glass?

271
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,830
Something happened.

272
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,957
Something happened!

273
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,635
I'll pack a bag for Mum,
take it over tomorrow.

274
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,711
She'll stay with Lucy
as long as she needs to,

275
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:51,830
or we'll take it in turns
depending on... how long it...

276
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,837
Well, the doctors seem confident she can
make a complete, proper, full recovery...

277
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,956
Did you know Lucy wasn't happy?

278
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,393
Sorry?

279
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,277
College.

280
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,430
What makes you say that?

281
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,472
Last term, before the holiday,

282
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,473
she said she was out of her depth
and that everybody was cleverer than her.

283
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,993
Oh, that's nonsense.

284
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,154
She said she wanted to give up -
come home and hide...

285
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,437
but she couldn't
because she was scared.

286
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,959
Of what?

287
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,598
Letting people down.

288
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,356
Why didn't she talk to me?

289
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,874
Are you making this up?

290
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,908
- Why didn't you tell us?
- She didn't want me to.

291
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,913
Said it wasn't fair, not after everything
you and Mum have done for us both.

292
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,353
She said...

293
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,989
she thought her birth mum and dad
mustn't have been very bright.

294
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,511
It's not your fault.

295
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,549
- So where do you live, Ruth?
- Got a flat in town.

296
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,632
- Are you not from round here?
- Originally, but...

297
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,950
- So what's brought you back?
- Nothing.

298
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,439
- Now, then.
- Oh, God!

299
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,750
- Here he is.
- God's gift, thinks he is.

300
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,913
Don't I know you?

301
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,355
- Take no notice of him.
- No, no, no, we've met before.

302
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,393
No, I don't think so.

303
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,199
Happen it were
in a previous existence, eh?

304
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,349
Happen it were.

305
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,311
I'm Bradley.

306
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,914
Hello.
Now you tell me what your name is.

307
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,592
- Don't tell him, Ruth.
- Oh.

308
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,637
So, what you doing
Friday night, then, Ruth?

309
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,278
- Nothing.
- Great.

310
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,998
- Don't hang about, does he?
- So...

311
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,117
a gang of us usually meet in Maggie's
about half-eight,

312
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,758
and we generally end up in the Aca.

313
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,594
- You coming?
- Yeah. Where d'you say you go?

314
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,477
The Acapulco.

315
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,913
Nightclub.

316
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,116
- D'you know it?
- Yeah.

317
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,599
Where is it?

318
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,240
- She doesn't know where the Aca is!
- So what?

319
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,756
It's not the centre of the universe.
I can meet you, Ruth, we can go together.

320
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,638
John?

321
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,832
Rufus?

322
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,911
Charlie?

323
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,353
Hello?

324
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,111
I want to help you.

325
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,595
Tell me what you want.

326
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,432
Show me what you want.

327
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,149
There's no need to be frightened of me.
I'm not frightened of you.

328
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,953
Why are you sitting out here?

329
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,712
Well, I'm not sitting in there.

330
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,029
We're living with someone else,
it's that simple.

331
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,749
Someone who is dead,
who is trying to draw attention to itself.

332
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,874
- Is anything missing?
- This isn't burglars.

333
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,793
You think burglars with a sense
of humour who don't steal anything?

334
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,950
I left my iPod on the kitchen table
in full view.

335
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,399
Perhaps we shouldn't say anything
to the boys.

336
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,993
Don't want to upset them.

337
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,471
Perhaps
we should put the house up for sale.

338
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,913
What an odd thing to do.

339
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,959
Well, it's mischievous, it's annoying,
it's what poltergeists do.

340
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,436
Perhaps something did happen here.
Perhaps we should try and find out.

341
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,751
Why don't I just ring an estate agent
instead?

342
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,238
Because I like this house and so do you,

343
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,596
and we're not being chased out
by somebody who's dead, that's why.

344
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,878
Where are the deeds?

345
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,678
There might be some clues in there.

346
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,512
Filing cabinet.

347
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,673
Right.

348
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,072
Right, now...

349
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:36,357
I'm putting this coffee table back like it was
and you're going to like it.

350
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,875
Everything's going to be fine.

351
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,990
We'll sort everything out.

352
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,959
Nothing's worth getting yourself
into a state like this.

353
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,433
I love you.

354
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,752
I'm sorry.

355
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,678
Say that again.

356
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,955
It was one of the conditions
of the adoption.

357
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,032
When whoever it was adopted her,

358
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,672
they specified that there was to be no
subsequent contact between you and Katie.

359
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,113
Could they do that?

360
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,599
Well, then they could.

361
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,116
They were so short of adoptive parents
15 years ago

362
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,953
- they'd agree to practically anything.
- Why?

363
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,393
Why though?

364
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,032
Cos they thought I were dangerous.

365
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,158
Not to her.

366
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,674
I loved her.
I would never have hurt her.

367
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,276
So, why didn't they tell me then...

368
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,678
...at the time?

369
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,554
Why didn't it occur to anybody,
so I wouldn't...

370
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,552
Day after day, year after fucking year,
hoping I'd hear back from her.

371
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,953
Sorry.

372
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,189
Bureaucracy, breakdown in
communications, usual cock-ups.

373
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,558
I know that's no comfort.

374
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,758
I loved her.

375
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,832
I thought the world of her.
She thought the world of me.

376
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,956
I never hurt her,
never laid a finger on her.

377
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,835
It were me that stopped her
from getting hurt.

378
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,797
It certainly isn't how they do things now,

379
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,997
but perhaps at the time,
they thought it was in her best interests,

380
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,550
given how young she was
and given what had happened,

381
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,108
and that you were inside anyway
by that stage.

382
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,077
Can't you find out for me where she is?

383
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,513
No.

384
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,355
Social services are no more likely to tell me
than they are to tell you.

385
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,795
They can't. They're bound by law.

386
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,155
She never had any of the letters and stuff
that I've sent her?

387
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,358
I would assume not.

388
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,352
But she can choose...

389
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,753
...to see me, can't she? Katie can.

390
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,599
Yes, she can.

391
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,358
So why hasn't she?

392
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,272
I don't know.

393
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,353
Unless over the years...

394
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,514
If they've never talked to her about you,

395
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,114
or passed anything on from you,

396
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,431
or encouraged her to think about you...

397
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,593
But she can't have forgotten about me,
though, can she?

398
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,111
No!

399
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,039
Ooh!

400
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,476
My God, Charlie, I can't believe
you traded my game for Tom's.

401
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,915
- It's so much better.
- I don't care!

402
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,197
- Stop moaning.
- Charlie, come back here!

403
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,555
Charlie, Charlie, listen to me...

404
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,240
John! John!

405
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,512
What's the matter?

406
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,959
Keep looking at her.

407
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,189
Why?

408
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,430
I don't know why, just do.

409
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,033
Hello.

410
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,308
Can I...

411
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,277
Can I help you?

412
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,157
I doubt it.

413
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,960
Are you... all right?

414
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,596
I don't mind you standing on my wall,
I'm just rather intrigued as to why you are.

415
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,716
I used to live here.

416
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,075
You...

417
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,949
I were born here. I grew up here.

418
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,712
We got chucked off.

419
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,153
Really?

420
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,158
So...

421
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,719
When was that, then?

422
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,870
15, 16 years ago.

423
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,474
I just wanted to look at it,
see if it had changed.

424
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,518
I've not been back, you see,
since then.

425
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,391
Do you want to see inside?

426
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,516
Inside the house?

427
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,230
I'm John, by the way.
John Ingram.

428
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,673
Are you?

429
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,393
I'm Ruth...

430
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,152
Slater.

431
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,111
Have you heard of me?

432
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,236
Should I have?

433
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,311
So you were tenants?

434
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,439
Me dad were. When he died, I always
thought I'd inherit t'tenancy off him.

435
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,112
He always reckoned I would.

436
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,872
They screwed us, the estate people.

437
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,349
Chucked us off, me and me sister.

438
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,868
We bought it from the Gaukrodgers,
that wasn't?

439
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,350
No, it's changed hands a few times
since the estate owned it.

440
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,868
Oddly enough, I've just been
going through the deeds.

441
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,833
My wife will be fascinated to meet you.

442
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,876
D'you know why?

443
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,439
Why?

444
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,399
Well, we've been having some odd things
going on, very odd things.

445
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,916
I mean, I don't hold much truck
with that meself, but,

446
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,070
we're starting to wonder
if we're haunted.

447
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,556
So you actually farmed here?

448
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,313
That's amazing.

449
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,470
Why? It's a farm.

450
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,678
I don't know, I imagined people hadn't
farmed here for much longer than that.

451
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,320
- Are you sure you won't?
- No, I'm not really a drinker.

452
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,678
So what did you and your sister do
when you were evicted?

453
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,352
She got taken into care,
and... I've never seen her since then.

454
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,953
- Why?
- She were adopted.

455
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,313
And...

456
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,509
...it's just the way it were.

457
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,670
- That's awful.
- She'd be 21 now.

458
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,597
I'd like to see her, but I can't.

459
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,993
Why?

460
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,350
Because I had a few problems back then
and they must've decided...

461
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,918
Don't know.

462
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,230
Seems very unfair now.

463
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,956
As I say, she were only six, so...

464
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,758
Happen she's forgotten me.

465
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,319
Six years old?

466
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,278
No, I don't believe that,
she won't have forgotten you.

467
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,918
I don't think she will have either.

468
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,752
We were really close.

469
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,032
Just things... happened.

470
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,518
It's all more complicated
than what I said, so...

471
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,999
Was it?

472
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,958
Where was your mother?

473
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,191
Oh, she'd cleared off...
years before when Katie were tiny.

474
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,998
Never heard from her since.

475
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,038
- She were alcoholic.
- Have you spoken to social services?

476
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,838
Yeah, but...

477
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,351
So, Ruth, did you when you lived here
ever experience anything odd?

478
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,715
No, not like what you described.

479
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,394
Course, us vehicles didn't often start,

480
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,631
but nowt mysterious about that
cos they were all knackered.

481
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,075
And, like, bulbs popping out,

482
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,549
that don't surprise me.

483
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,430
Electrics were always a bit dodgy,
cos see, you're at the end of the line here,

484
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,432
so you might get surges and that.
I dunno.

485
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,759
Your other stuff,
like the fridge, coffee table,

486
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,152
and the... the "help me"...

487
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,350
Help me.

488
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,678
...it's weird.

489
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,638
I better be getting off.

490
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,837
- I'll give you a lift to the bus stop.
- No, you're all right.

491
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,956
It's fine, it's no problem. I'd like to.

492
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,271
- Listen, Ruth.
- What?

493
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,318
I do quite a bit of work
with the social services.

494
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,756
I'm a family lawyer,
we both are, me and Izzie.

495
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,469
D'you want me to see
if I can find anything out about Katie?

496
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,233
- Can you?
- I can't promise anything, obviously.

497
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,275
- No.
- Well?

498
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,635
- Yeah.
- What's your phone number?

499
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,837
I ain't got one yet... at t'moment.

500
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,751
Let me give you mine.

501
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,913
There you go.

502
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,717
Look... there's probably more to it
than what I said.

503
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,552
Well, there is.

504
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:42,030
I used to get in trouble a lot
when I were younger, wi't'police.

505
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,839
That's why they didn't want me
to have any contact with her.

506
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,796
I would've assumed
it was something like that.

507
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,552
It were a long time ago.

508
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,993
I'm not like that any more.

509
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,709
Give me two weeks, OK?

510
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,273
Look at you!

511
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,920
She's only had lemonade
and she's all over the place.
