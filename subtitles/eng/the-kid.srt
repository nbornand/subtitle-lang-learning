1
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:24,033
The Kid

2
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:31,633
Fucking idiot.

3
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:35,933
My name is Kevin. I was born
Croydon, South London.

4
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:40,433
It was in March 1993
a Wednesday, I think ...

5
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:44,033
when I decided to suicide.

6
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:52,133
As a quick-thinking
entrepreneur I used my initiative.

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,667
And I gave myself a head start.

8
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:52,633
Based on a true story.
The Kid </ i>

9
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,133
Mother.

10
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,767
Not even try to ask.

11
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,833
Allowed Kevin to come out to play?

12
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,900
Get out and go get him.

13
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,267
Kevin, I am.

14
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,967
She said you can out
come to play.

15
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,900
Come on.

16
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,633
Loser, loser, loser ...

17
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:34,633
Is all right, Kevin?
Come on.

18
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:47,267
Kev.

19
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,833
Hey you, it's not a fucking firm.
Go away. Go away.

20
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,467
Get out! Get out!

21
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,900
I let a fall.

22
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,900
Bum, bum!

23
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,133
Home sweet home.

24
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:29,133
Where the hell are you been?
I sat here all day in my uppie ...

25
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:33,400
while you all our money back
wasted in the pub.

26
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,967
I cannot fucking bear!

27
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,400
Are you listening to me?
- Shut up!

28
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:45,400
Asshole! You're wasting all our money
in the fucking pub.

29
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,767
You leave your family in this house are
and is rather small with pus.

30
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:54,633
Keep your cat! You
no, do you?

31
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:57,333
Why you with that little crazy.

32
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,633
Yes, old pervert.
What is wrong with you.

33
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:05,600
What the hell is wrong with you?
Is there anything apart from you?

34
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,900
Kevin!
Wake up, little lazy sucker!

35
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,767
Arise!

36
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What is that?
What is that?

37
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,833
Have you peed in your bed again?
- Sorry.

38
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:34,467
Weather? Who should clean?
- It was an accident.

39
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,900
I'm going to fucking do not clean up.
You go clean up?

40
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:41,767
Sorry.
- You'll be sorry damn!

41
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,633
Listen to me.

42
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,333
Stop!
- You will not tell me to stop!

43
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,633
Stop!
It hurts. Get off me!

44
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
Stop!

45
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:12,467
Kevin.

46
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,767
Kevin.

47
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:24,400
Why cannot you fucking him
not alone?

48
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,267
He wet the bed again.
You want to go clean?

49
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,633
Have you seen how his face looks like?
Why do you always have?

50
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:33,333
You damn sensitive son.
Someone has him raising ...

51
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,467
Is everything OK?
- Yes.

52
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:42,900
Go on, get the hell out,
like you always do.

53
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,900
Fucking mess.

54
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,467
Kevin, come here.

55
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:55,600
Let me see.

56
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:59,633
It looks good.
Fresh yourself up and fuck off from school.

57
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Do you have pain anywhere else?

58
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,267
I want a look, just to have
sure.

59
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:17,500
Do only your sweater and your shirt,
Good boy.

60
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,733
You know what? You can have him!
I want him anyway.

61
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,533
Is there something to see or something?

62
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:49,333
Are you the first time in a car?
- Yes.

63
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,100
I cannot send back home.

64
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:04,233
He is among the most experienced foster parents
been with him but no one can handle.

65
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,600
He is a bit shy.

66
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:10,967
Good God, he stabbed him!

67
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,100
Well, he has some problems.

68
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,467
This is my helmet.

69
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:25,167
Can we meet at least as
meet and talk?

70
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,300
Yarborough Orphanage </ i>

71
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,933
He is not at all to send.

72
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,833
If someone had too much affection show,
person he is.

73
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,933
Fuck off! Fuck off!

74
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,833
How old is he?
- Ten years.

75
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:48,600
They say he is like a wild animal.
- This is not surprising, right?

76
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,833
Hello.
- Hello.

77
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,533
Come on.

78
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,733
I do not think Kevin ...

79
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,967
misbehaved.
Because he is uncontrollable.

80
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,467
I think nobody has ever bothered
taken him to tell ...

81
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,433
how to behave.

82
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:05,067
Let's go inside.
Watch out for the Yucca Palm.

83
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:06,933
It is only
taught to school ...

84
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:08,833
and then locked up again
to be in his room.

85
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:13,433
Here we eat.
Here, we have a separate room.

86
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:17,467
This young man did nothing with
than hatred or violence.

87
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:21,467
Fuck off! Fuck off!
- How dare you say that to me.

88
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:25,333
He behaves as in
these new families ...

89
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,600
that because he never
level of freedom known ...

90
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,233
that a child of that age
normally has.

91
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,533
Does that mean that you accept him?

92
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:39,667
No.
We are full of.

93
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,600
I have no bed for him.

94
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:45,800
Hello!

95
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
You must be Kevin.

96
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:51,333
Can you call me Uncle David?
Will you do that?

97
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:55,467
Okay, come let me show you something.
This way.

98
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,800
It's okay!

99
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:05,333
I am afraid that all our beds occupied.

100
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:08,100
So why have we made for you.

101
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,967
It's like your own little cabin.

102
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:14,800
As in 'the Stig caveman ".

103
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:20,333
I know it's not a nice room,
it is until we find one for you.

104
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,833
How long will I stay here?

105
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:28,067
Well, I do not think there are plans
to send you someplace else.

106
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,600
We want you to stay here.
If you want to stay.

107
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:35,967
Yes, please.

108
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:38,967
Billy went to the ...

109
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,467
River
- River.

110
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:47,333
Use the edge of the knife
See?

111
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:50,933
That is the cutting area.
Like this.

112
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
It goes well.
Go on, go ahead.

113
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:56,533
Do not let go.
- Yes, I get a little loose.

114
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,967
Cut it on.

115
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,833
I let you go now!
- No!

116
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,467
Go on you have the address!
Keep going.

117
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,433
Put your teeth.

118
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,067
Come here.
Put your teeth.

119
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:26,733
Yeah, so.

120
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,433
Walk.

121
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:31,333
Come on.

122
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:33,467
Day!

123
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:38,967
"Stig looked down on them with
eyes wide open ...

124
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,233
picked them and admired them.
Of them in the light. "

125
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,933
"No, Stig", said Barney.
"You cannot have."

126
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,733
You baby, why are you crying?

127
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,967
I almost touched her.
- Watch this, this.

128
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,100
What are you doing?

129
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:12,067
Kevin rot.
- Yeah fuck off piece of gear.

130
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,967
Otherwise we do it for you.
Hey, she is crying.

131
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,733
Uncle David.
Come quick, they fight.

132
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,067
Her mother is fixed ugly.

133
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,667
How do you kiss your mother with that face?

134
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,300
Leave her alone.

135
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,833
Or what, Kev?
Why would you ...

136
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,300
I kill you!
- Fuck you!

137
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,433
Kevin.
- Get off me.

138
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:44,733
Get off me!
- I put you down when you calm down.

139
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,433
Come on.
- Get off me!

140
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:49,600
I let you go later
if you're calmed down.

141
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,467
Let me out of here!

142
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:56,067
It was his fault, he began.
- No.

143
00:13:56,167 --> 00:14:01,767
I will not let you out. No.
Not until you're calm. No.

144
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,500
I know what happened.

145
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:09,933
Why did not you warn me?

146
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:15,300
We'll be fine with Chris.
Happy.

147
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:20,867
Look at me.

148
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,633
I thought we were friends.

149
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,933
Look at me.

150
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,667
Look me up!

151
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,800
You need not be ashamed of yourself.

152
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:15,000
You are among friends here.

153
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,767
Nobody will hurt you.

154
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:38,000
Surprise!

155
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:42,633
For many years, the Lewis family is very
according to the Social Services.

156
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,867
Unlike my predecessors ...

157
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:47,767
I try to dissociate
Mrs. Lewis.

158
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:51,500
Which are very noisy in the household.

159
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:55,933
And so I encourage her more
independent.

160
00:15:56,267 --> 00:16:00,167
Ms. Lewis also asked whether
Kevin can come back home.

161
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,567
It would be nice.

162
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:06,933
Then we have another family.
It makes all the difference.

163
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:09,667
We miss him greatly.

164
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,633
I know my pastor all these
requests rejected.

165
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,667
So does the
we can get Kevin back?

166
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,933
But I now think that Kevin and the entire
families will benefit from his return.

167
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:28,800
Yes.

168
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:33,433
When will you tell him?

169
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:36,167
I do not know.

170
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:46,300
You do not have much contact with your
family had since you're here, huh?

171
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,067
They have a number of changes
through and ...

172
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:54,167
they seem to talk much can.
I've heard.

173
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,067
So?

174
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,300
They want you back.
- No.

175
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:06,867
I'm not going back home.
You said I could stay here.

176
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,567
I do not want you
worried about.

177
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:14,067
In any case, your brothers and you will
your sister is missing, right?

178
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,667
Yes.

179
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:20,133
But I like it here.
And I want to stay here.

180
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:24,000
And you said I could.
You promised.

181
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:29,433
I cannot go back.
I would not go back, I want to stay here.

182
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:04,500
Kevin.

183
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:06,867
Come on, step.

184
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,633
I'm sorry.

185
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,667
If it were me you could stay.
- Ask them if I can continue.

186
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,667
Ask them!
Please!

187
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:43,633
I have not owned.
Sorry.

188
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,567
What will they do?
What has he done?

189
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:52,567
You're a big boy my friend.

190
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,933
You have a big heart.
You're very special.

191
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,933
And no one can from you.

192
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:04,267
You must always remember.

193
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,167
I'll take that.
- Here are his belongings.

194
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,733
I'll have a few weeks back
to see how Kevin has settled itself.

195
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,633
Yes, okay good.

196
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,900
Hope you all get out
this new start?

197
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,133
Yes, we do, for sure. Yes.

198
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,633
Here's your family allowance book
It has been updated, so Kevin is there.

199
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:43,900
Exactly. Thank you.

200
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:46,133
Thank you for that.

201
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:48,267
All right.
- Good.

202
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,733
Is that it?

203
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,200
Yes, I see you in a few weeks, okay
- Good. Yes, see you then.

204
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,133
Girls, leave him alone.
- Kevin!

205
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:11,733
How was it?
- Great, you would have enjoyed.

206
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,833
But you have to be happy
you're back?

207
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,200
Look for a job. You can not
, and sit all day drinking.

208
00:20:22,633 --> 00:20:27,467
I cannot find a job. I have epilepsy,
they leave me no longer on the train ride.

209
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,500
I know you fuck
epilepsy, but you need ...

210
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,633
now, and another
type of job.

211
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,767
Daddy?

212
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,200
Shut up.
- Are you okay?

213
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,767
Dad, calm down.

214
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,133
Stay calm dad.

215
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,833
Dad, calm down.

216
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,967
Dad, calm down.

217
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:03,500
Stop staring at him.

218
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,767
Dad, Dad!

219
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,200
Where the hell have you been?
Weather in the cafe?

220
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:12,500
I have been waiting for.
And you, he is just five minutes back ...

221
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,133
and he sits back in the cafe.

222
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:16,267
Come back here, you little prick!
Come here!

223
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,967
Leave him alone, do you want.

224
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,133
Why are you always so?
You never do anything!

225
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,133
Your dad would have beat you more often.

226
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,133
Do not touch my father! Get off of him!

227
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,900
Do not hurt him!

228
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,767
You little prick!

229
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,767
You gonna just stand by and watch?
Let him do it?

230
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:00,833
Do not touch me!

231
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:03,767
I gotta fucking have him.
Come here!

232
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,767
You tried to give me a right,
is not it?

233
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,767
Yes, you did it?
I will see what your right hand is doing.

234
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:14,333
No!
- Yes, I'll fucking show.

235
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,733
Dad!

236
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,767
Could you give me a right?
- Dad, she's going to do it. Help me!

237
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,967
Dad, help me!
- Do not turn away from me.

238
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:26,500
Please let me go.

239
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:34,833
So, as a bird with a broken wing
flies that perfect circles ...

240
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:40,000
fate had brought me back to
this pink tin house ...

241
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,100
where nothing ever changed.

242
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:56,400
The outside world changed.

243
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,633
But my world did not change.

244
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,733
Hey, Kev!

245
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,900
Is it okay?

246
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,967
Shut up, Claire!

247
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,400
It feels like with fries.

248
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
My name is Mr. Smith.

249
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,400
The new dude.
- And for you who do not know ...

250
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,633
I am your new teacher.

251
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:28,333
Let's go to Tesco
where Kevin gets his best clothes away.

252
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:34,000
I come out of Liverpool ...

253
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:38,000
as you know what home is
of the world's best football team.

254
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,267
Dalglish, corner.

255
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,767
Yes, top of the league.

256
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:48,767
And of course where the best pop music
comes from the world.

257
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,900
Okay.

258
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,733
You are here to teach.

259
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,200
And I'm here to teach.

260
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:59,467
Want to buy my sweets vouchers?
- 50 cents each.

261
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,400
Two pounds for the whole zakie.
There you can buy a lot of soaps.

262
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,333
And I really love my job.

263
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:08,400
So, you do your work
and I do mine.

264
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:12,333
And who knows, you are taught
as much fun as I like to give.

265
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,900
Any other questions? Not? Well.

266
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,467
Go to page 34 of your book, please.

267
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,200
Act one, scene one, King Lear.

268
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,267
You in the back, so are you.

269
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,967
Sir, he cannot hear you,
because he is a bum.

270
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,267
That's enough.

271
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,900
What is this?

272
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:38,467
Lewis?

273
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:42,133
No, good, you may remain behind.

274
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:44,400
Then the bum anyway
have somewhere to go to it.

275
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,767
And you can join him in detention.
Sit down.

276
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:52,900
Otherwise you can sit again detention.

277
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:58,400
Well, that's twice detention.

278
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,733
Three times detention.

279
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,067
Kev, please.

280
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:09,233
Four times in detention. Look, we can solve this
continue to do the whole lesson, Lewis.

281
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:15,967
Okay, back to your books.

282
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,300
Okay guys,
You can store your stuff.

283
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:28,300
Reynolds, it is better that I do not
see more, so try to conduct yourself.

284
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:31,600
Lewis, same time tomorrow.

285
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,433
Hey you two.

286
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:33,233
Okay guys, that was it.
You may go home now.

287
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,933
Suggsy,
These do not belong in school uniform.

288
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,233
Kevin, what's going on.

289
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:50,533
You're always tired and never concentrated.
And your attitude in class is horrible.

290
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:53,733
Sorry, just leave me alone.
- Kevin?

291
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:57,967
Wignall, you're next.

292
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:59,967
What is that?
- But, sir ...

293
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:03,433
Hold that down, you're next.
Go inside.

294
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:07,433
... ... Not at school.

295
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:44,333
Gordon which is the story of Lewis?
- Lewis without shorts?

296
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:48,300
I have little to do with him.
He never does it ...

297
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:51,533
is always an excuse,
You know those figures though.

298
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:54,100
I mean, I do not gossip.

299
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,733
Of course not, Gordon.
- But since you asked ...

300
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:02,733
His father is an alcoholic and his mother
Frankenstein's rags, or something.

301
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,467
Troubled, you know.

302
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:12,333
His brothers and sisters go to
another institution you know.

303
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:16,833
Lewis is clear of the family.

304
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,667
Ok guys, here we go. I am somewhat
later, Samantha Fox kept me busy for a while.

305
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,467
Lewis, not wear shorts?
- I have a note ...

306
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,600
No shorts, Lewis? No shorts?
- I have a note from my mother.

307
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:49,600
No shorts, Lewis?
It's four weeks in succession Lewis.

308
00:28:50,067 --> 00:28:51,300
Clothes.

309
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:55,667
Okay, guys in the gym.
A lap and we do some stretching.

310
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:58,533
Thank you. Smith, so it is.

311
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:02,967
One, two, three one today and fun
to have had Madison.

312
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,467
Lewis.

313
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,967
Now you feel?

314
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,333
Okay, get dressed.

315
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:17,600
That's detention,
no answer back.

316
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:24,733
Do you like classic music?

317
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:28,600
I have not heard before.

318
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:32,600
Do you find the sound of
nice restful moments?

319
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:40,233
I can make a copy for you if you
likes it?

320
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,800
I have nothing to play it.

321
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:59,467
Take this.
That is my old one.

322
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,233
Where are the bruises from, Kevin?

323
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,333
Let me see the scars on your neck.

324
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:43,267
Where do they come, Kevin?

325
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,800
She keeps biting me.

326
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,867
And those other places?

327
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:55,933
A belt buckle.

328
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:05,000
Yes, I know the Lewis family very well.
How may I help you?

329
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:09,567
Well, Kevin has blue spots and bites
his whole upper body.

330
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,800
When did this happen?

331
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:14,500
To be honest, I think
it been a while in progress.

332
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:17,433
What makes you so sure?

333
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:20,167
Who did this to you Kevin?

334
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:24,800
They did.
- You mean your mother?

335
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:27,800
How long has it been going?

336
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:32,667
Since you have put me back there.
- Tell me the truth, Kevin.

337
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:34,300
I do.

338
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,000
Why did you bring me this
than never told?

339
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:39,667
Because you fucking me
never asked. Or you?

340
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:43,000
Where did the bruises come from?

341
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:45,633
Precisely so, now ...

342
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:50,500
He tried to give me a smack and missed,
and fell down the stairs. Or not?

343
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:55,433
Kevin?

344
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:58,433
Is that what really happened?

345
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:36,300
Kevin, can we talk here soon?
- No, I'm busy.

346
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:39,067
Everything all right, Mr. Smith?
- Yes, I am fine director. Thank you.

347
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:42,500
I did not realize that he
would.

348
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:45,567
Why cannot your nose
my business account?

349
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,167
Look, I know you do not want to talk
but I would have brought you.

350
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:56,667
I have nothing to play with.

351
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,667
All right, Kev?

352
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,433
Hey, where one is that of
love bites that I've heard about.

353
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:15,567
You do not girlfriends
spell it?

354
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:20,667
See how they mock him.
- Do not get involved.

355
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:24,400
They tease him for his bite wounds
in his neck.

356
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,000
Lewis Dark Force.

357
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:28,167
Come on, let the guys
see that love bites ...

358
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:29,400
where we have heard.

359
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,867
He was kissed by Dracula.

360
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,800
Sorry, that was not my intention.

361
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:37,567
What?
- Sorry.

362
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:40,800
Come on, let's go talk,
you and me.

363
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:44,567
Dominic, it meant nothing.
- Shut up, Clair.

364
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,400
It runs from the hand.

365
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,867
I'll go with you.
- You cannot save them all, Collin.

366
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:03,767
Go fucking dead.

367
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:09,800
Lewis, that's enough.
Take it easy.

368
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:12,867
Quiet, boy.
Relaxed.

369
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,633
It's over.

370
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:22,067
Provoked or not,
I shall not tolerate such behavior.

371
00:34:23,867 --> 00:34:25,933
Well, boy?

372
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:37,400
Close the door.

373
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:51,667
Stand up.

374
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,767
Thank you, sir.

375
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:06,800
Sit down.

376
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:15,633
You will also have no contact
with your son, Mrs. Lewis.

377
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:18,500
We take him to a new location
and a new school ...

378
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:20,833
and it is up to Kevin if he still wants to see you.

379
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,267
Do you understand?

380
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,000
We will miss.
- I'll also miss you.

381
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:27,967
Kevin, do not go.

382
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,467
I'm going and i do not come back.

383
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:34,633
Get out the damn car.

384
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:39,833
C'mon, Kevin.

385
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,900
I'm sorry for everything that happened.

386
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,733
Hang in there, huh?

387
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:02,000
Take care of yourself.
With us will be fine.

388
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:16,767
Sometimes fate just looks the other way ...

389
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,400
perhaps derived from the misery
someone else.

390
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,133
And the Angels of Prosperity ...

391
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,500
bring you into safer hands.

392
00:38:35,633 --> 00:38:37,600
Hi, Kevin.

393
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:40,600
I'm Alan.
- Hi, Alan.

394
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,100
Come take a look at my wife.
This is where we live.

395
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,000
Nice.

396
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:50,767
You're a bantamweight I see.

397
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,000
What is that?
- Do you know anything about boxing?

398
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:55,733
No.

399
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,767
Me will show you your room.
And I have a job for you.

400
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,267
This is my Margaret.

401
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:08,267
Hello, Margaret.
- Hi, Kevin.

402
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,900
Great to have us up.
Welcome, come inside.

403
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,767
Come and sit down, Kevin.
Take a glass of lemonade.

404
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,633
Thank you.

405
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:03,267
If you have that then I help.
- With what?

406
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,400
To pick apples from the tree.
- Okay.

407
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:09,767
I do not want them spoiled.

408
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,967
I suppose though.
- Thank you.

409
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,633
If they fall under,
then they rot.

410
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,467
I am too old to myself to climb,
but you have exactly the right size.

411
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,200
Good.

412
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,500
Good, but put them there.
- They are coming from it.

413
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:39,000
Alan was a local sports legend.

414
00:40:39,267 --> 00:40:42,633
One vendor accounting
taught at night school.

415
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:45,767
He did so well that he
early retirement.

416
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,633
And Margaret, his stylish
beauty queen from the '50s.

417
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:54,200
Together they were the best
teenage parents.

418
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:57,600
New school.

419
00:40:58,467 --> 00:41:00,900
New school friends ...

420
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Hobbies and interest in sports.

421
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:08,833
A Saturday job.
My own money.

422
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,267
Saturday Friends.

423
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,900
My name is Kevin.
- Paul, nice to meet you.

424
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,767
A healthy sense of competition.

425
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,600
Lessons.

426
00:41:20,733 --> 00:41:22,833
Can I drive, please.

427
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:24,500
Very well.

428
00:41:24,633 --> 00:41:26,767
Do you drink?
- No.

429
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,900
Sort of legally.

430
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,767
Family Friends.

431
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,000
Get there in, Stirling Moss.

432
00:41:35,267 --> 00:41:37,600
Terry, how are you?
- Good boy.

433
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:38,967
How is the new Frank Bruno?

434
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:41,300
Like him who has trained,
He is terrible.

435
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:45,467
I have you learned how to do it.
- I learned from the best.

436
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,333
I know you retire,
but maybe you want me one favor?

437
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,100
What then?

438
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,100
Look at my accounting.
Skattefar killing me.

439
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:59,233
Life was no longer
about survival.

440
00:42:02,233 --> 00:42:06,467
Then I was hit by a new sense
that gnawed at my bones ...

441
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:10,733
probably most dangerous of all:

442
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:13,600
boredom.

443
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:16,967
But that was about
to change.

444
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:21,600
People's Capitalism is nothing less ...

445
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:25,833
a crusade
to many a voice.

446
00:42:26,233 --> 00:42:28,967
Privatization is moving.

447
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,800
Millions have already become shareholders.

448
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:34,800
And soon there are possibilities
for millions of people ... more

449
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:38,100
in British Gas, British planes,
UK airports.

450
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:47,833
Teen Millionaires ...

451
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,233
fortunes
within one second of bravery.

452
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:56,833
The world was to buy
and I wanted my share.

453
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:00,433
I wanted a part of.

454
00:43:02,467 --> 00:43:05,067
"London International Financial
Deadline Fair "

455
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:19,967
"You can succeed today" </ i>

456
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:45,100
I want school.

457
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:49,600
How long have you been here
thought?

458
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:52,100
A time.

459
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:56,467
What should you do when you are away?
- I want a trader on the stock.

460
00:44:00,467 --> 00:44:02,833
Kevin, cannot wait?

461
00:44:02,967 --> 00:44:06,600
You have so many more possibilities
if you finish school.

462
00:44:06,733 --> 00:44:08,967
You have made enormous progress.

463
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:12,967
You've only just had time with us
your level lift.

464
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,733
This year you have the O-levels
out, that's right anyway, honey?

465
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:16,967
Yes, you're right.
Margaret is right.

466
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:20,467
I would really like to do.

467
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:23,733
Kevin, am thinking it through
about it.

468
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:27,167
If you go off of school, you
as an adult.

469
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,067
You will take care of yourself.
We can no longer take care of you.

470
00:44:31,967 --> 00:44:35,667
Yes sorry
but this is really what I want to do.

471
00:44:39,533 --> 00:44:43,667
I was like you when I was young.
I thought I could control the world.

472
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,300
You've made it myself.
- Yes, but it was not easy.

473
00:44:47,433 --> 00:44:51,467
I know that look in your eyes.
You will not change his mind.

474
00:44:52,433 --> 00:44:53,667
Well ...

475
00:44:54,533 --> 00:44:57,333
come back and visit us, boy.

476
00:44:57,467 --> 00:45:01,333
And remember that I always
for you are, if you need me.

477
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:05,100
This is the BBC news of one hour.

478
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,233
The familiar face
the stock exchange in London.

479
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:47,300
You do not have the experience.

480
00:45:47,433 --> 00:45:50,233
You do not have diplomas.

481
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:54,467
Well, then you have no chance.

482
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,467
No references.

483
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:05,300
No background.

484
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:08,967
No connections to the school of yesteryear.
No uncle who sits in those cases.

485
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:28,167
"No way kid,
Do not you understand what no means? "

486
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:33,800
But I will show them.

487
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,967
I can wait.

488
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:40,733
I can handle this.

489
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,667
I will be part of it.

490
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,233
I will succeed.

491
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:51,467
I will show them a winner.

492
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:55,467
He does not
blows to get it?

493
00:46:56,233 --> 00:46:57,233
No size, no.

494
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,533
For the winner the spoils.

495
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:13,500
Did you consider a pro?
- And to be as ugly as you?

496
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:16,300
Chips?
- Yes, good.

497
00:47:17,933 --> 00:47:22,300
How's the job search?
- Well well, I have many ...

498
00:47:22,567 --> 00:47:25,167
I have a few options
I choose from.

499
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,067
Meet your new friends,
Mr. and Mr. Mop Bucket.

500
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:31,567
I want lots of shiny.

501
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:34,500
Some Swede wants to change this
in the furniture store.

502
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,567
A furniture store.
Idiots.

503
00:47:38,867 --> 00:47:43,800
If you can get no job,
come to me. I will help you to work.

504
00:47:43,933 --> 00:47:46,567
Thanks, Terry
but I want to do it through official channels.

505
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:49,500
I respect that.
But keep it in mind.

506
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,067
Cheers.
- Cheers.

507
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:52,933
Well done son.

508
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:55,567
The equity market
London will not take ...

509
00:47:55,567 --> 00:47:57,767
recover than after a
change in New York.

510
00:47:57,867 --> 00:48:00,167
Investors need
strong nerves.

511
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:02,567
The Dow Jones index
the price shows ...

512
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:04,133
of the 30 major stock ...

513
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,133
The city has little London
to look forward to ...

514
00:48:08,167 --> 00:48:12,267
then mass redundancies in
The entire financial sector.

515
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:14,867
What you gonna do?

516
00:48:16,267 --> 00:48:20,433
I start my own business.
I want my own boss.

517
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:22,567
In what?

518
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,800
I do not know yet.

519
00:48:25,933 --> 00:48:29,633
But we'll think of something.
- Good.

520
00:48:30,933 --> 00:48:32,800
How do you do with the money?

521
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,133
This is the landlord, open the door.
Open the door, you have to pay the rent.

522
00:48:36,267 --> 00:48:37,800
Open the door for me.

523
00:48:37,933 --> 00:48:41,767
When the door is not opening it
I call it a man who ...

524
00:48:41,933 --> 00:48:44,000
Not so good.

525
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,767
I know.
The landlord called.

526
00:48:47,867 --> 00:48:49,167
Fascinating.

527
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,800
Here, take this.

528
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,633
Since you're gone astray here
Margaret and I often this house ...

529
00:48:58,767 --> 00:49:01,800
we considered it to
sell for something smaller.

530
00:49:01,933 --> 00:49:04,133
If we do,
I have some extra money.

531
00:49:04,133 --> 00:49:06,800
I would be some
invest in your company.

532
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:10,667
Seriously?
You do not need to.

533
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:16,167
But God come with a good idea
and a solid business plan.

534
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,933
I might be old
but I'm not stupid.

535
00:49:22,567 --> 00:49:24,867
Be careful, son.

536
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:27,800
Onwijs thanks.

537
00:50:09,067 --> 00:50:11,767
Is it well with you, boy?

538
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,267
Yes.

539
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:18,767
Alan, was a good man.

540
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:26,633
You must know that he really
proud of you. Do you?

541
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:29,667
Here, throw that back it.

542
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,567
Okay?

543
00:51:06,633 --> 00:51:10,000
Kevin, it's not easy
To tell ...

544
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:13,167
but once I left home with the whole
contents have sold ...

545
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,300
I decided to Euan and his family
in Australia to live.

546
00:51:19,933 --> 00:51:22,933
I must proceed to the next
part of my life ...

547
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:26,933
to stop a mother,
and enjoy that I am Grandma.

548
00:51:28,067 --> 00:51:30,400
Do you understand?

549
00:51:32,933 --> 00:51:34,500
Yes.

550
00:51:37,667 --> 00:51:41,933
I know Alan wants me to rule
that care would be for you.

551
00:51:45,767 --> 00:51:48,167
And if I buy the house?

552
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:50,800
How do you do that?

553
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,167
If I take a mortgage on the house,
I can use the money from Alan ...

554
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,400
for one company to develop and
to pay off the mortgage.

555
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,933
I make you proud.

556
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,800
Self-Employed Mortgage?
Everyone does it ...

557
00:52:04,933 --> 00:52:06,567
She has boosted the price for a
deposit to do.

558
00:52:06,633 --> 00:52:09,067
If I were you I would draw
and make sure he continues to pay.

559
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,567
Goodbye, Kevin, and good luck.

560
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,433
Indicating that damn thing.

561
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:37,300
Hey, Kev. That was long ago.
- Hi Paul, so for a long time.

562
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,933
I heard about Alan. Mind you it
After losing, he was a top guy.

563
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:47,700
I go out at the end of the week,
sense to go? Of course you sense.

564
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,767
Here he lives
- Very sexy.

565
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:52,100
Sure.
- Hi, Kev.

566
00:52:52,133 --> 00:52:55,200
Hi, man. You have made it say,
How can you afford this?

567
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:58,000
I do not need,
The rental company is so stupid.

568
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,833
They think that it is in repair.

569
00:53:00,967 --> 00:53:03,267
Kev, this is Mandy.

570
00:53:04,133 --> 00:53:06,500
And this is ...

571
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:11,000
Kev, me and Mandy to anything
old friends to say hello.

572
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:13,900
Okay.
What do you want?

573
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:19,200
Like a Blue Lagoon ...

574
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:23,833
two Jack Daniel's with Coke
and a Sex on the Beach, thank you.

575
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:35,833
Hey listen, there is no ass to.
We will stay here.

576
00:53:35,967 --> 00:53:39,400
Kev, we're here.
- Okay.

577
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,733
Kevin. How are you man?
- Hi, Terry.

578
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:53,833
Leave it down, Kate.
- Thanks, Terry.

579
00:53:55,767 --> 00:53:58,467
Why is he not in?
- Who?

580
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,600
Sorry.

581
00:54:00,733 --> 00:54:03,133
Stupid cow.
- Sorry.

582
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,100
Give me the blame.

583
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,500
Kev.

584
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:28,900
Where is he going?
- I do not know.

585
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,400
No, later.
- Can I get a drink?

586
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,633
Paul? I'm talking to you.

587
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:43,467
Mozart, is that all you've done?
It does not clean itself, either?

588
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:52,400
Hello, can I speak with Margaret?

589
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,100
Margaret, the sale of the house is round,
and I have not received anything.

590
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,500
I understand this right, Margaret ...

591
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:31,767
I sit with a mortgage which I totally
to have no chance to redeem?

592
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,767
Enough? Alan I have the money needed to
company to start the mortgage so I ...

593
00:55:39,767 --> 00:55:41,267
to expectations, as planned.

594
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,333
But I cannot in any other way
the mortgage payment. I have nothing.

595
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:51,000
Mr. Lewis?
- Yes?

596
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:55,000
You are summoned.
- What's this?

597
00:56:55,267 --> 00:56:58,333
Assignment for seizure.
See you in court.

598
00:56:58,467 --> 00:57:01,000
No, I make sure you get the money.

599
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:04,400
Mr. Lewis,
you have not once paid.

600
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:08,733
I just thought that there was a plan.
- It is too late.

601
00:57:14,733 --> 00:57:16,633
Hold on to that nervous thing.

602
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,767
You said no one car for
would miss at least six months.

603
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,267
Do not know who to hire him.
They think he is in repair.

604
00:57:26,633 --> 00:57:29,267
So you do nothing
worry about it.

605
00:57:37,633 --> 00:57:39,733
Why do we have here
previously thought?

606
00:57:41,467 --> 00:57:43,133
What's going on?

607
00:57:43,267 --> 00:57:45,967
Well, that's not enough for
one month mortgage.

608
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,633
Come on man, you're crazy.

609
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:52,467
You can also earn some extra
with the smuggling of liquor and cigarette butts.

610
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,900
Problem is that everyone is doing it,
So there is not much help himself.

611
00:57:56,133 --> 00:57:57,767
More than this.

612
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,133
The problem is that I a
bit fast need.

613
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:05,400
Maybe I have something for you.

614
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,767
If that real talent
of you want to use.

615
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,500
Smell,
which smells of?

616
00:58:11,633 --> 00:58:14,600
Gin.
- Throw in Tonic, a slice of lemon ...

617
00:58:14,733 --> 00:58:18,500
and you notice no difference
if you on a few of them.

618
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:22,667
Here, take this.

619
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:25,667
That should be enough for you,
until I've picked some.

620
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,467
Lee takes you home
and gets you in a few days.

621
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,933
Terry thanks, I appreciate it.
- Go ahead.

622
00:58:33,733 --> 00:58:35,933
Buy a pack or something.

623
00:58:38,233 --> 00:58:40,933
What is this thing?

624
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,600
I think it's a Swedish
furniture is.

625
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:47,433
Fascinating.
Ready to make some money?

626
00:58:47,533 --> 00:58:48,833
Yes.

627
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,333
What have you,
you'd better take off your coat.

628
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:25,600
It can be somewhat messy.

629
00:59:25,733 --> 00:59:28,100
What? What do we do?
- You will see.

630
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:30,833
Here we go.

631
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:35,467
Wait a minute.
What are we doing?

632
00:59:37,233 --> 00:59:40,833
The winner takes the pot.
The loser gets nothing.

633
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:43,167
The winner? I'm not ...
What do you mean? I'm not ...

634
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:46,100
Hi Terry.
What is it for one type of work?

635
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,667
Just a little boxing.
Just like at the club.

636
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:52,933
Okay.
- A little entertainment for the boys.

637
00:59:53,067 --> 00:59:55,833
Does that suit?
- Yeah, fine.

638
00:59:56,233 --> 00:59:59,467
Okay, boy. Good to see.
- Nice to see you. Are you okay?

639
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:01,967
What's the name of that boy?

640
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,733
"The Kid."

641
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:07,833
Just an encouragement to the challenger, all right.
Big applause for The Kid.

642
01:00:11,967 --> 01:00:15,100
Should not I change clothes?
- What, no, not necessarily.

643
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:19,467
And what of our own fighter, Smudge?
Bring our fighter on in, boys.

644
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,467
Come on, get him.

645
01:00:26,533 --> 01:00:29,733
Come on. Get him.

646
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:32,800
What about boxing gloves?
- You do not need them.

647
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:40,600
Okay, be ready.

648
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:53,100
He bit me.

649
01:01:05,967 --> 01:01:08,467
He will be slaughtered.
- Wait.

650
01:01:08,967 --> 01:01:10,933
Dull wanker.

651
01:01:14,433 --> 01:01:16,800
You skinny wretch.

652
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:19,300
Okay, here he comes.

653
01:01:28,967 --> 01:01:31,733
Come down, come on boy.
It's okay.

654
01:01:32,467 --> 01:01:35,533
It is enough.
Enough Kevin, come on.

655
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,600
Yes, it's okay.

656
01:01:39,733 --> 01:01:41,600
He bit me.
Why he bit me?

657
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,800
You did good.

658
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:44,733
Skinny wanker?
- Well done, boy.

659
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:47,600
Voila.
That sets him to thinking.

660
01:01:47,733 --> 01:01:49,967
You have a few minor scratches.

661
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,333
Are you okay?

662
01:01:54,467 --> 01:01:56,833
Yes.
- Well done, boy.

663
01:01:58,467 --> 01:02:01,067
Actually done by The Kid, right?

664
01:02:02,467 --> 01:02:03,967
Here.

665
01:02:04,967 --> 01:02:08,733
Next time I make you pretty
paid, right?

666
01:02:10,433 --> 01:02:12,833
Well done.
Bring him home.

667
01:02:14,933 --> 01:02:17,067
What did you do then?
- Nice.

668
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,600
I told you so?
- Yes, boss.

669
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:24,467
I thought you were a wimp.
Really, I think you are a wanker.

670
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:30,467
But it turned out well, boy.
You gave him good at his thunder, right?

671
01:02:32,167 --> 01:02:35,733
I have a headache.
- I have a few pills here.

672
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:38,333
Wrap it up.
- Thanks.

673
01:02:38,933 --> 01:02:42,300
You definitely wanted to win, huh.

674
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:46,733
It was not that hungry, right?

675
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,467
Halifax Property
vs. Mr. Lewis, Your Honor

676
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,067
Halifax is working on a seizure.

677
01:02:55,167 --> 01:02:57,533
Mr. Cooper
what do you say in this case.

678
01:02:57,667 --> 01:03:02,067
Mr. Lewis has no payment
done over the last 6 months.

679
01:03:02,167 --> 01:03:05,667
Your Honor, I last month
worked hard, to pay what I could.

680
01:03:05,733 --> 01:03:07,933
Instead of asking you one guess
to risk and accept a check ...

681
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:11,800
I have two and half months’ rent today
to me, in cash.

682
01:03:11,933 --> 01:03:15,667
Now I have a job, have the promise
arrears to be paid as soon as I can.

683
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,733
Mr. Lewis, you have 60 days to
your payments up to date market.

684
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:22,333
If that fails,
Mr. Cooper will be here again.

685
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:26,533
I want to show you something. Get in the car.
I'll take you anywhere you go.

686
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,100
I thought you were gone, friend.

687
01:03:38,533 --> 01:03:40,333
Here it is.

688
01:03:42,233 --> 01:03:43,833
Come inside

689
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:47,233
Once a good spot.

690
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,433
It sat here packed, starting nine hours.

691
01:03:51,433 --> 01:03:55,833
But the manager just disappeared.
I will not run itself.

692
01:03:55,967 --> 01:03:59,000
It needed a fresh face,
a new start.

693
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:02,067
Want to try?
- What do you mean?

694
01:04:02,933 --> 01:04:05,800
It was what you wanted, right?

695
01:04:05,933 --> 01:04:08,000
Your own business.

696
01:04:08,667 --> 01:04:09,633
Yes.

697
01:04:09,767 --> 01:04:14,133
Instead of letting the brewery
I can rent it to you.

698
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,300
What's the catch?
- You buy all of us drink.

699
01:04:17,433 --> 01:04:20,633
I have your bill to make it easy to keep.
And you pay the rent to us.

700
01:04:20,767 --> 01:04:24,133
Then we pay again on the brewery.
- We get no problems.

701
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,500
Do I have a business plan?

702
01:04:27,633 --> 01:04:32,300
There are a number of unpaid bills,
but I like the account in the holes.

703
01:04:33,067 --> 01:04:34,933
What do you think?

704
01:04:36,133 --> 01:04:39,767
I do not do charity
so I want my share.

705
01:04:39,867 --> 01:04:42,867
But what remains, you may keep.

706
01:04:42,933 --> 01:04:45,300
Is that enough for a plan?

707
01:04:48,633 --> 01:04:50,667
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

708
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,800
You are not on the list.

709
01:04:59,933 --> 01:05:03,433
Hi, Donna. Everything okay?
- Kevin. Everything good?

710
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:07,633
Those two are with me.
- Tell the boss that the Kid is here.

711
01:05:22,867 --> 01:05:25,067
Kevin, sit down.

712
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,000
Come on, girls.
Kevin, I have something for you.

713
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:31,267
Here. A contract.
- Take a drink for him.

714
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,667
Put a signature.

715
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,667
Yet to him.
He has not signed.

716
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,800
Let's do it.

717
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,933
Kevin Lewis.

718
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,933
The keys to your first bar.
- Happy birthday, man.

719
01:05:49,067 --> 01:05:51,433
Onwijs thanks.

720
01:05:51,567 --> 01:05:53,633
Congratulations, Kevin.

721
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,667
A glass of champagne?

722
01:06:04,933 --> 01:06:09,167
What are you celebrating?
- I just bought my first bar.

723
01:06:09,867 --> 01:06:12,400
How cool. Congratulations.

724
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,633
Thank you.
- Keep an open party?

725
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,167
Yes.

726
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,933
Absolutely.

727
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,567
Kevin, my friend.

728
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:38,067
Champagne. Right here.

729
01:06:58,933 --> 01:07:02,933
Give it to the girl in the blue dress.
It is the case.

730
01:07:06,567 --> 01:07:08,500
I take it over.
- Kevin told me ...

731
01:07:08,633 --> 01:07:12,433
That is fine. Now, fuck off.
Just go nice and window cleaning.

732
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:17,767
Ladies, would you mind when I
come on down?

733
01:07:19,567 --> 01:07:21,667
Did you enjoy yourself?

734
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,933
Well done, Kevin.
It was super tonight, man.

735
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:35,767
Come, bring me home.
- Hurry up.

736
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:40,133
Are you ready?
- Who is that?

737
01:07:40,267 --> 01:07:42,633
Sorry, my darling.
Is it okay?

738
01:07:43,133 --> 01:07:46,633
Is everything okay?
- I think I'm alone.

739
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,167
Come, take a drink with me.
- OK.

740
01:07:55,767 --> 01:07:59,433
I have some ...
I have not yet used.

741
01:07:59,567 --> 01:08:02,500
Thanks.
It's like New Year's Eve.

742
01:08:05,167 --> 01:08:07,800
There must be another one coming.

743
01:08:11,767 --> 01:08:15,567
What should we do with this?

744
01:08:18,933 --> 01:08:22,567
How is it to a personal assistant
to be?

745
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:27,567
Okay. It paid the bills.
Nothing to write home about.

746
01:08:28,067 --> 01:08:31,767
How is it to be independent?

747
01:08:31,867 --> 01:08:34,867
The accounts payable
Nothing about ...

748
01:08:35,133 --> 01:08:40,433
no, I hope one day me
the freedom to do what I want.

749
01:08:40,567 --> 01:08:42,067
That sounds good.

750
01:08:43,667 --> 01:08:45,800
What about family?

751
01:08:46,567 --> 01:08:48,667
What do you mean?
- You know, the usual.

752
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,167
Siblings?
Where did you grow up? Such things.

753
01:08:55,767 --> 01:08:58,633
There you will hear nothing.

754
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,400
Of course I do.
Me wants to know everything about you.

755
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,167
What do you do?

756
01:09:14,433 --> 01:09:19,067
There is so much.
I do not know where to begin.

757
01:09:19,067 --> 01:09:20,767
I want to write.

758
01:09:20,867 --> 01:09:23,067
I have fewer books read
then I want to ...

759
01:09:23,067 --> 01:09:24,767
but I would be a good writer.

760
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:29,767
I want to travel.
I want to go to America.

761
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:33,767
I have so many ideas, so many
ways to do things better.

762
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:36,400
I want to be successful.

763
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:42,000
I do everything to show a success.
Because I can change things.

764
01:09:43,133 --> 01:09:45,133
Come on, boy.

765
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,133
See you later.

766
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:54,000
You should not rush too much.
Otherwise you cannot enjoy it.

767
01:09:55,633 --> 01:09:58,400
Did you know that Edison invented the light bulb
when he was 24 years.

768
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:02,400
Orson Welles Citizen Kane wrote,
25 when he was.

769
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,633
My God, I would have worn.

770
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,767
Lee.
- What?

771
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:19,900
I have the bill, mate.
- Sorry size. Sorry, you dirty ...

772
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,100
Please.

773
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:25,467
Fuck.

774
01:10:25,767 --> 01:10:27,633
Okay, can we go?

775
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,767
You usually eat lunch at your office?

776
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,633
There's your pies.

777
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:34,500
Self-made.
- Nice.

778
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,267
Homemade pies,
than from the store.

779
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,833
This is a kind of tradition,
that homemade.

780
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,733
All right, Lee?

781
01:10:47,133 --> 01:10:50,633
We usually only six.
- Yes, there's too many ordered.

782
01:10:50,767 --> 01:10:53,500
It's all right, that Terry controls.

783
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:01,900
How's that little girl,
plans for the future?

784
01:11:02,733 --> 01:11:05,000
Who knows.
- That's true.

785
01:11:05,267 --> 01:11:06,633
Magic

786
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,833
It's okay.

787
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,400
It's okay.

788
01:12:07,467 --> 01:12:11,333
Who are these?
- Nothing.

789
01:12:11,467 --> 01:12:15,267
Why do you write on the walls?
What are you, a caveman?

790
01:12:15,633 --> 01:12:19,600
No, I've always done.
It helps me think.

791
01:12:19,767 --> 01:12:22,000
I think you're fantastic.

792
01:12:22,967 --> 01:12:26,400
Want a shower?
There is hot water and ...

793
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,967
I only have a towel,
but ...

794
01:12:30,267 --> 01:12:32,633
I go up water.

795
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,633
Going well?
- Well, Terry?

796
01:12:50,767 --> 01:12:54,500
How's business?
- Well, busy evening yesterday.

797
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,900
Penfold says you still can not
break even.

798
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,767
The debt is growing all the time.

799
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,200
It does not match.

800
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:06,633
What about wages?
Labor costs are too high?

801
01:13:06,767 --> 01:13:09,767
Can you cut? Who are your employees,
friends of yours?

802
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,600
We were better off,
when the matter was closed, Kevin.

803
01:13:12,733 --> 01:13:15,633
I still have the rent
and pay municipal charges.

804
01:13:15,633 --> 01:13:16,600
Yes, but you ...

805
01:13:16,733 --> 01:13:21,833
Am I right when I say that you first
own company, Kevin?

806
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,500
I can let others see ...
- It's all right, boy.

807
01:13:29,733 --> 01:13:31,400
But do not worry.

808
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:35,333
Do what you do best.
Lee gets to you later.

809
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:41,267
Lee, can we delay?
Got me an appointment with a girl tonight.

810
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,633
Sure, no problem.
Have fun.

811
01:13:43,767 --> 01:13:46,633
Wait a minute.
Who do you work again?

812
01:13:46,767 --> 01:13:51,100
You would still pay the mortgage?
Get in the car.

813
01:13:52,467 --> 01:13:56,400
Put your work, then you're done in ten
minutes, and you can go to your girl.

814
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,667
Would you ...
- Sure.

815
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,733
Hello

816
01:17:26,067 --> 01:17:28,667
No, she's gone for lunch.

817
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,667
No, she did not say.
I do not know. Good.

818
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,600
Goodbye.

819
01:17:34,933 --> 01:17:37,300
Thanks.
- It's okay.

820
01:17:56,467 --> 01:17:59,233
I'm sorry.
- What happened?

821
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:03,233
Nothing. I cannot ...
- Again something you cannot tell me?

822
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:06,667
I, Jackie. Please
- In God's name.

823
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,833
I just wanted ...

824
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:25,967
Sorry. I promise I again
okay flavor.

825
01:18:26,233 --> 01:18:29,333
Catherine said you was out with Lee,
last night.

826
01:18:29,433 --> 01:18:31,533
It's not what you think.

827
01:18:31,667 --> 01:18:35,300
It's not only about last night.
There are other things.

828
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:38,833
You do not even know what I mean.
- What should I know then?

829
01:18:38,967 --> 01:18:43,467
You come here to ensure, under the bruises,
but you cannot say which.

830
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,733
You never shows me any affection.
You never say you love me.

831
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:51,433
And drawn on the wall,
That is not normal.

832
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:59,233
Say something.

833
01:19:07,467 --> 01:19:09,733
It's really fun.

834
01:19:11,233 --> 01:19:13,333
Just go away, Kevin.

835
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:22,833
Take a drink.

836
01:19:29,467 --> 01:19:31,733
I'm going to the bar closed.

837
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,333
But as I said,
It is busy every night ...

838
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:36,100
and you'll have everything
what constitutes the bar.

839
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:37,533
What more can I do.

840
01:19:38,667 --> 01:19:42,100
All write, go bankrupt.

841
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:44,600
Please do not
if I have no job ...

842
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,467
I cannot pay my mortgage,
I can live anywhere.

843
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,800
Then I have two large debts.

844
01:19:49,933 --> 01:19:52,833
Do not talk about blame
against me. Your fight ...

845
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:55,067
last night cost me Â£ 20,000.

846
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:56,733
What do you mean?

847
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:59,600
I thought you would lose, dammit!

848
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:16,100
Why are you so serious?

849
01:20:16,233 --> 01:20:20,167
You are now a single woman.
- I thought he might call.

850
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:25,433
You have to get over it.
Okay, come on. I take you for lunch.

851
01:20:25,467 --> 01:20:29,100
Kevin I am Julie. I did not know who
to call me, it's about Mama.

852
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:30,467
Wait, hold on, Julie.

853
01:20:30,733 --> 01:20:34,967
Why do you have beaten the grandchildren?
They are full of bruises.

854
01:20:34,967 --> 01:20:37,067
Where the hell are you doing?

855
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,067
I have touched him gently.

856
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:43,667
You get not one more time, you hear.
Otherwise you will get with me

857
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,433
Is that supposed to frighten me sometimes?

858
01:20:46,567 --> 01:20:48,433
I've heard about you
you let your ass beat ...

859
01:20:48,433 --> 01:20:50,567
for money,
that's all you can.

860
01:20:50,667 --> 01:20:54,800
There you are good enough, and actually
you should thank me ...

861
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:58,567
I've helped you to not one
little weakling to be, or not.

862
01:20:58,667 --> 01:21:00,300
You dirty quitter.

863
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:04,567
He gives me nothing, I mean ...
- He just wants you in his bed.

864
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:07,167
No, he does want to
I think, it's just ...

865
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:09,300
how hard I try to open.

866
01:21:09,867 --> 01:21:11,933
But then go away again.

867
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:14,067
Wayne I just had to get ...

868
01:21:14,067 --> 01:21:16,800
and not you. You're
not my son, damn it!

869
01:21:16,933 --> 01:21:19,933
I am never fucking been.

870
01:21:29,567 --> 01:21:31,667
Public sale </ i>

871
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,167
Try to
BMW to get.

872
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:13,267
Okay, but what do you drive?
- Do not worry about it.

873
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:19,500
Are you sure you want to do?
- If you but to me that one thing controls.

874
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,400
Kevin, come on, man.
- Yes, I'm coming.

875
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,567
Hurry, we gotta go.
- Okay.

876
01:23:27,667 --> 01:23:31,300
After the fight, go down the list

877
01:23:31,433 --> 01:23:33,767
Nobody else, only you.

878
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,500
Paul?

879
01:23:36,867 --> 01:23:39,867
I lose my temper, boy.

880
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,767
Where you going?
- Where nobody could find me.

881
01:23:51,433 --> 01:23:54,767
It's all right, man.
But do not worry about me.

882
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:56,567
What are the benefits to the game?

883
01:24:56,667 --> 01:25:01,500
Ladies and gentlemen, here comes our favorite
boxer back in the ring.

884
01:25:02,567 --> 01:25:05,433
The Kid in the ring.

885
01:25:06,133 --> 01:25:08,633
You had better fucking win.

886
01:25:13,067 --> 01:25:15,767
Take this money and put it on Whagger.

887
01:25:15,867 --> 01:25:20,067
And favorite boxer,
from Ireland: Whagger.

888
01:25:30,867 --> 01:25:33,567
That Whagger wins, okay.
- Yes.

889
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,833
Fight back?

890
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,833
Do you pee in your bed again?

891
01:27:56,267 --> 01:27:58,500
Useless wanker.

892
01:28:00,633 --> 01:28:04,100
Take this useless piece of shit here.

893
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:12,467
Acorn.

894
01:28:53,733 --> 01:28:57,000
Excuse me, are you Julie?
Kevin's sister?

895
01:28:57,467 --> 01:29:00,200
I am Paul, a friend of Kevin.

896
01:29:00,333 --> 01:29:04,400
He asked me to give you this.
I know not what it is.

897
01:29:11,267 --> 01:29:13,600
Can I help you?

898
01:29:13,733 --> 01:29:17,500
I am a friend of Kevin.
I had to give you this.

899
01:30:14,133 --> 01:30:16,133
I go from school. </ i>

900
01:30:16,267 --> 01:30:17,500

Thanks, I appreciate your help. </ i>

902
01:30:20,633 --> 01:30:23,133
I get my own businesses. </ i>

903
01:30:23,267 --> 01:30:25,600
What if I buy the house? </ i>

904
01:30:25,733 --> 01:30:27,467
I am the owner of </ i>

905
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,900
I just bought my first bar. </ i>

01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:32,267
I will be a success. </ i>

907
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,267
Toss coin. </ i>

908
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,500
Who have you hired?
- Regulates Terry it. </ I>

909
01:30:48,633 --> 01:30:50,900
Put everything on the other. </ i>

910
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,600
I look at the bills.

911
01:30:53,733 --> 01:30:57,133
still heard nothing.
- Sign damn our agreement. </ I>

912
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,767
Bankruptcy, write off everything. </ i>

913
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:04,500
He might as well my

914
01:34:09,533 --> 01:34:11,233
Claver Ford Croft
Administration </ i>

915
01:34:17,233 --> 01:34:20,467
Can I help you?
- Kevin Lewis, for Mr. Croft.

916
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,833
The stairs, half left.

917
01:34:29,967 --> 01:34:32,233
Hey, pal. Got it?

918
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:37,733
You should talk to a guy that
we get the car. Here is the money.

919
01:34:38,467 --> 01:34:40,600
Kev, be careful.

920
01:34:42,667 --> 01:34:47,233
Want to keep this for me?
Thanks, Paul.

921
01:34:55,833 --> 01:34:59,933
In the container on the right.
A little brown envelopes.

922
01:34:59,967 --> 01:35:04,533
Make sure it is what you want.
I say where the bullets.

923
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:22,467
A double three, delicious.
- Please.

924
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,833
You little bastard.

925
01:35:30,233 --> 01:35:32,600
You have guts ...

926
01:35:40,233 --> 01:35:42,167
Do not be stupid, boy.

927
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:45,600
I'm stupid too long.
You got me used as an idiot.

928
01:35:45,733 --> 01:35:48,300
What are you talking about?
- You have deceived me.

929
01:35:48,433 --> 01:35:51,467
You knew I was desperate
and committed an abuse of me.

930
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:55,833
What would you like?

931
01:35:56,100 --> 01:36:00,300
I've been with Mr. Croft.
A nice man. An accountant.

932
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:07,167
He has everything checked.
This is what I owe.

933
01:36:12,233 --> 01:36:15,167
That's without the Â£ 60,000 debt
of the bar ...

934
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:17,467
income tax and insurance
you withheld.

935
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:21,067
And salaries and bills of the beverage
from your club, I paid.

936
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:23,533
That's a whole list.

937
01:36:24,533 --> 01:36:27,533
Be careful to whom you
weapon focus, boy.

938
01:36:27,667 --> 01:36:32,233
I have nothing to lose.
I'll shoot you first and then drop myself.

939
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:10,100
You had so much money.
And yet you had to sell me.

940
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:13,833
Pick it up.

941
01:37:14,167 --> 01:37:18,933
I do not want that. I want what belongs to me
guilty, and nothing more.

942
01:37:25,133 --> 01:37:28,300
And if you can sign.

943
01:37:29,067 --> 01:37:30,767
And here.

944
01:37:44,433 --> 01:37:47,667
You look a little pale.
Why do not you sit?

945
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:51,167
Was there anything else?
- Yes.

946
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:56,667
When I exit that door, then
you and I finish with each other.

947
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,933
Play the tough guy,
I tell it to anyone.

948
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:05,433
But, if you ever get close to me,
I'll finish.

949
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:10,567
Do you understand?

950
01:38:14,567 --> 01:38:17,800
You going to do anything?
Well just let this fool ...

951
01:38:17,933 --> 01:38:19,500
And you ...

952
01:38:20,267 --> 01:38:23,667
talking too much, and are rude.

953
01:38:45,933 --> 01:38:48,400
Hi, mate, please.
You now have a bar.

954
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:53,067
Come on, I've been drawing.
Thanks for the watch.

955
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:04,300
Sir, may I help you? Go there
within, they have a meeting.

956
01:39:04,433 --> 01:39:06,433
Hi, chocolate people.

957
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:11,500
Hi, I have respect
for what you do.

958
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:13,567
Sorry I apologize for interrupting you.

959
01:39:14,433 --> 01:39:16,567
But what I am about to say,
is the most ...

960
01:39:16,567 --> 01:39:19,167
most important thing I ever said,
in my life so far.

961
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:21,167
And, it only takes a minute.

962
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,767
Kevin!

963
01:39:26,867 --> 01:39:29,167
I love you.

964
01:39:30,567 --> 01:39:33,300
Yes, I do not care
who overthrew pushes.

965
01:39:34,633 --> 01:39:36,000
I've run push, Jackie.

966
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,433
I spent my whole life
things pushed Jackie.

967
01:39:38,567 --> 01:39:40,800
But you need not push.
You know.

968
01:39:40,933 --> 01:39:42,767
I have to go over things step ...

969
01:39:42,767 --> 01:39:45,633
and only wear what is important,
and that is you.

970
01:39:46,933 --> 01:39:51,800
I do not care for money, jobs and cars
and chocolate and stuff like that.

971
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,767
No disrespect intended.

972
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:56,167
I love only you.

973
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,667
That is all that counts.

974
01:40:00,667 --> 01:40:05,567
There are one million things that I have
should have mentioned, much earlier.

975
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,667
A few thousand of them
are written here.

976
01:40:14,267 --> 01:40:17,300
You let me not be ashamed
for myself.

977
01:40:20,167 --> 01:40:24,500
Now I am going to clean our house.
Thanks, chocolate people.

978
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:46,267
I'm so proud of you.

979
01:41:01,767 --> 01:41:03,667
What is this?

980
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,400
What is this?

981
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,567
Who gave you this?

982
01:41:14,667 --> 01:41:17,067
It sat there.

983
01:41:31,067 --> 01:41:32,867
You must share it.

984
01:41:41,433 --> 01:41:43,433
That was the beginning of his
own incredible journey.

985
01:41:43,567 --> 01:41:46,567
Kevin is with us today,
with his wife Jackie.

986
01:41:46,667 --> 01:41:49,267
Very nice to meet you.

987
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:52,667
Many have read your book,
"Kevin Lewis, The Kid '.

988
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:57,567
And this is the incredible story of
You growing up in south London ...

989
01:41:57,667 --> 01:41:59,800
in the 70 and 80.

990
01:42:00,067 --> 01:42:04,067
When you grew up you had a good ...
Now I get too agitated ...

991
01:42:04,167 --> 01:42:06,767
you had a good teacher at school ...

992
01:42:06,867 --> 01:42:10,633
seeing that you lived under
terrible conditions ...

993
01:42:10,767 --> 01:42:15,067
because the house was close to the school.
Your garden was full of waste.

994
01:42:15,167 --> 01:42:17,767
I tell everyone here ...

995
01:42:17,867 --> 01:42:20,567
how proud I am of you.

996
01:42:20,667 --> 01:42:22,667
Every day.

997
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:27,400
Get out now, you're not too old
should continue to check.

998
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:28,933
Thank you.

999
01:42:29,433 --> 01:42:34,133
Tell me, how's the family,
Dennis and Gloria you see anymore?

1000
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:38,067
I do not read books.

1001
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,967
I am a father.

1002
01:42:48,533 --> 01:42:52,733
Yes?
- Yes.

1003
01:43:27,267 --> 01:43:31,267
Dennis my book described a man
was very limited intelligence ...

1004
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:34,267
themselves nurtured in care.

1005
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,633
And described how Gloria
six years of her youth ...

1006
01:43:36,633 --> 01:43:39,400
spent at a
psychiatric institution.

1007
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,500
Both were victims of abuse.

1008
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:45,467
Not really a Golden Couple
or parental material.

1009
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,633
But, maybe somewhere behind the
dark clouds of the past ...

1010
01:43:48,767 --> 01:43:53,633
there were sunny days
they loved each other.

1011
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:03,200
But life
is not about the past.

1012
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:06,500
It's about the future.

1013
01:44:08,133 --> 01:44:11,767
And how happy you can be there.

1014
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:46,000
The kid was 18 weeks
on the bestseller list ...

1015
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,833
and number one for six weeks.

1016
01:44:47,967 --> 01:44:52,967
Kevin lives in Surrey with his family
and is a successful crime writer.

1017
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:58,633
Had I known that the book
would be issued ...

1018
01:44:58,767 --> 01:45:01,767
I did not have much left in it
, and had not been published.

1019
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:03,767
Because the unspent
would be ...

1020
01:45:03,767 --> 01:45:06,400
until I got the last two
Chapters wrote ...

1021
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:11,133
so it's a fair description.
And I owe to Jackie.

1022
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:20,400
The message to the people at home
in a situation imprisoned?

1023
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,333
You must first look inside
to yourself ...

1024
01:45:22,633 --> 01:45:24,467
and when you go to yourself inside
have looked ...

1025
01:45:24,467 --> 01:45:27,900
look out and see what you
have to do to get there.

1026
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,500
So take, take small steps at a time.
But you must continue taking.

1027
01:45:32,633 --> 01:45:35,833
Don't think at dominating the world.
