2
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,476
Downfall

3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,112
I feel as if I should be angry
with that child, that...

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,717
naive young girl.
Or that I must not forgive her...

5
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,112
for not recognizing the
nature of that monster.

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,750
For not being aware of what
she was getting into.

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,674
And especially that I went
along without thinking.

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,188
Because I wasn't a fanatical Nazi.
I could have said, in Berlin:

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,876
"No, I'm not doing it. I don't want
to go to the Führer's headquarters."

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,669
But I didn't do that.
I was too curious.

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,435
I also didn't realize...

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,357
that destiny would take me somewhere
I didn't want to be.

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,516
But, nevertheless, I find it hard
to forgive myself.

14
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,752
The ladies are here.

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,829
It's confirmed.
–They can pass.

16
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,556
<i>"Wolfsschanze"
The Führer's Headquarters</i>

17
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,439
<i>November 1942
Rastenburg, East Prussia</i>

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,355
Sit down, ladies.

19
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,157
One moment. The Führer is feeding
his dog. He'll see you in a minute.

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,672
Can you tell us... How are we supposed
to address the Führer?

21
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,231
The Führer speaks to you first
and you reply: Heil, mein Führer.

22
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,632
And the Nazi salute?
–That won't be necessary.

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,828
since the Führer isn't looking for
a soldier, but for a secretary.

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,310
Act as normal and calm
as you can.

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,040
I'll see if he
has time for you.

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,472
Mein Führer,
the ladies from Berlin are there.

27
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,757
Thank you, ladies, for coming
in the middle of the night.

28
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,877
Sometimes, during a war,
one is not in control of time.

29
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,073
Can I ask your name?
–Margarethe Lorenz. Heil, mein Führer.

30
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,595
Where are you from?
–From Fulda. Heil, mein Führer.

31
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,469
And what is your name?
–Ursula Puttkammer. Heil, mein Führer.

32
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,394
No need for that.
Where are you from?

33
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,869
Frankfurt am Main, mein Füh...

34
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,034
Hannah Potrovsky,
born and raised in Berlin.

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,998
In Pankow, to be precise.

36
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,470
Hedwig Brandt
from Crailsheim, Swabia.

37
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,479
And you are?
–Traudl Humps. I'm from Munich.

38
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,955
A lady from Munich.

39
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,553
Fräulein Humps,
shall we start then?

40
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,632
My Blondi won't hurt you.
She's very intelligent.

41
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,475
She's much smarter
than most people.

42
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,948
First, sit down, please.

43
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,557
Don't be nervous. I make
many mistakes during dictation.

44
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,712
You won't make nearly as many.

45
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,788
You're very young.

46
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,272
How old are you?
–22, mein Führer.

47
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,995
My fellow German countrymen and women...

48
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,957
...fellow party members.

49
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,430
It is, I think, rather remarkable...

50
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,755
that, after 20 years of service, a man still
stands in front of his supporters...

51
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,351
...and that in all those 20 years, his
program has never needed modification.

52
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,592
I suggest we try it again.

53
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,279
I did it.
He hired me.

54
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,631
<i>Berlin - April 20, 1945
Hitler's 56th birthday</i>

55
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,392
<i>Two and a half years later</i>

56
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,198
Take cover.

57
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,913
Continue. Hurry.
Get that off the street.

58
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,272
Take cover.

59
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,558
That's artillery fire.
–Don't be silly. Where would it be coming from?

60
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,589
You're right. Those aren't planes,
it is artillery.

61
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,117
It's the Russians.
What a birthday present.

62
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,954
Burgdorf, where are those
artillery shells coming from?

63
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,793
Happy birthday,
mein Führer.

64
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,474
Downtown Berlin is under fire.

65
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,952
Shells have hit near the
Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag.

66
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,839
Where did they come from?
–We don't know yet.

67
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,390
I have Koller on the line.
–Give me Koller.

68
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,031
Koller, do you know Berlin
is under artillery fire?

69
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,556
No.
–Can't you hear the shooting?

70
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,792
No, I'm in the Werder Game Park.
–Berlin is in chaos.

71
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,997
Apparently, the Russians captured
a railway bridge over the Oder.

72
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,789
The enemy has no railway
artillery near the Oder.

73
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,951
It's not long-range artillery.

74
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,194
The anti-aircraft defense near the
Zoo-Bunker reports they're calibers of...

75
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,638
...10 to 12 centimeters. The Russians
have positions near Marzahn.

76
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,112
That's only 12 kilometers from the center.
Are the Russians that close?

77
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,239
They should hang the entire
Luftwaffe leadership.

78
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,200
This is unheard of.

79
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,352
The Russians are 12 kilometers
from the city center.

80
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,830
Nobody told me anything.
I had to ask.

81
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,319
Maybe it's long-range artillery,
after all.

82
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,029
That railway bridge over the Oder...
–Nonsense.

83
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,996
You shouldn't do that, Fräulein Braun.

84
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,153
He already eats nothing
but cake all day long.

85
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,359
Don't be so strict.
It's his birthday.

86
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,469
He deserves something nice.
He has so little fun.

87
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,999
I'll bring up some more bottles.

88
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,755
Suddenly everybody wants some.

89
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,517
I'm glad that you help him in these
difficult times. He appreciates you enormously.

90
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,958
What do I do for him?
–Cheer him up.

91
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,750
His generals always bring him their troubles.
He doesn't want to hear it anymore.

92
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,957
You'd be troubled, too.

93
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,032
The city center is already
being shelled.

94
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,829
I hope it doesn't rain down
during his birthday celebration.

95
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,754
Nothing will happen.
–Still, it seems risky.

96
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,233
Just do like everybody else, Frau Jung,
and let the Führer decide.

97
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,718
That Himmler,
such a pompous buffoon.

98
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,637
Party bosses, everywhere.
They make me so sick.

99
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,398
The Führer started
"Clausewitz" today.

100
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,519
Berlin on the front lines.
He won't be able to keep the city.

101
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,990
If the Führer stays here,
the Reich will go down with him.

102
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,392
We have to talk him out of it.
Talk to Hewel.

103
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,597
He's the only diplomat
with any influence on him.

104
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,150
Hewel tried everything.
It's useless.

105
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,278
Talk to your sister-in-law, then.

106
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,719
Why not? You're married
to the sister of Eva Braun.

107
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,714
We must try everything.
Berlin is almost surrounded.

108
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,474
You're still young.
You'll be a father soon.

109
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,677
Do you want die here?
–Absolutely not.

110
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,476
Gentlemen, the Führer.

111
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,831
Everything out, quickly.
We're leaving in two hours.

112
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,590
What's going on?
–We're leaving.

113
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,991
"Clausewitz" has started.

114
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,869
All the ministries and departments
are leaving Berlin.

115
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,589
And who's going to look after
the people and the soldiers?

116
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,912
Don't ask me, professor.
–This is insane.

117
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,149
Professor.

118
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,993
I won't allow the
evacuation of my office.

119
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,312
Is that so?
–The food supply will collapse.

120
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,517
A good soldier can
always find food.

121
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,470
And when there's fighting all over the city,
where does he get it? The population.

122
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,553
It's irresponsible.
–It's an order from the Führer.

123
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,676
As a department head, I
report to the SS and to Himmler.

124
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,231
But as a doctor, I'm part of the Wehrmacht
and they're not leaving yet.

125
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,198
Keep that in mind.

126
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,353
The professor stays in Berlin.
Get him the proper papers.

127
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,038
We're leaving.

128
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,791
Everything for Germany.
Heil, mein Führer.

129
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,678
Führer, I...
Heil, mein Führer.

130
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,757
They're in such a hurry
to get away from here.

131
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,990
The brown nosing is the worst.

132
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,039
They say "Sieg Heil," but they think
"Lick my... you know what."

133
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,798
Mein Führer, I beg you to leave Berlin.
It's not too late yet.

134
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,076
Too late?

135
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,838
Hewel, come here for a moment.

136
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,437
I'm sure you agree we should contact
the Allies...

137
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,072
...and start conducting politics.
–Certainly. We need politics.

138
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,153
Politics?
I don't do politics anymore.

139
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,788
I'm fed up with it.

140
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,471
When I'm dead, you'll have plenty
of time for politics.

141
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,875
It's OK, dear Himmler.
My loyal Heinrich.

142
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,277
It's OK.
Just go.

143
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,789
He has no strength left.

144
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,953
What did you expect from a
vegetarian teetotaler?

145
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,238
Seriously, though, Fegelein.
I'm taking control now.

146
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,960
Berlin will fall in a few days.

147
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,955
When the Führer's dead, who will
the Allies negotiate with?

148
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,078
Why do you think they'll
negotiate with you?

149
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,789
The Nazi state and my SS are needed
to maintain order.

150
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,872
One hour with Eisenhower
and he'll feel the same way.

151
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,670
The first contact has been made.
–Careful, that's high treason.

152
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,308
Fegelein, I have other concerns.

153
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,429
Should I give Eisenhower the Nazi salute,
or shake his hand?

154
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,879
Look at this.

155
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,708
The cleaner guests arrive
later in the evening.

156
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,316
Leaving already, gentlemen?
I wanted to talk to you.

157
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,600
The scorched-earth orders...
–I really have to go now.

158
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,593
Come and see me one day
in Hohenlychen.

159
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,759
I'm going north to help with the
battle of Berlin there.

160
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,999
You know, Speer... There's an
advantage to those bombings.

161
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,518
It's easier to clean up debris
than to demolish everything ourselves.

162
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,678
When the war is won,
reconstruction will be quick.

163
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,397
We've spent thousands of hours
together with these models.

164
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,990
You're a true genius, Speer.

165
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,353
Yes, absolutely. Only you and I know that
the Third Reich would be inconceivable...

166
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:52,152
...with only warehouses and factories.
Skyscrapers and hotels.

167
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,916
This Third Reich will be a
treasury of art and culture...

168
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,231
...that will survive thousands of years.

169
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,632
We see, before us, the ancient cities,
the Acropolis...

170
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,997
...medieval cities,
with their cathedrals...

171
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,278
...and we know that the people
need that.

172
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,554
Yes, Speer.

173
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,108
That was my vision...

174
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,040
...and it still is.

175
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,598
Mein Führer, if you want to realize
these plans, you must leave Berlin.

176
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,593
Eva, you say something.

177
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,036
He's the Führer.
He knows what's best.

178
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,716
You must leave Berlin.
The Russians almost have us isolated.

179
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,790
I can't do that, my child.

180
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,353
I would be like a lama priest
with an empty prayer wheel.

181
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,753
I have to solve the problem,
here in Berlin, or perish.

182
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,638
Speer...

183
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,677
...what do you think?

184
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,792
You have to be onstage
when the curtain falls.

185
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,518
Reload.

186
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,628
Go away.
Leave me alone.

187
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,793
How old are you? Twelve?
And you? Fourteen?

188
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,191
Why are you here?
To play at war? Go home.

189
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,875
Who are you? What do you want?
–I want my son. Alive.

190
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,635
You should be proud.
He destroyed two tanks.

191
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,156
The Führer will decorate
him for it today.

192
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,949
You're young.
Which front did you fight on?

193
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,076
I... haven't had the honor yet.

194
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,394
Consider yourself lucky.
Send the children home.

195
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,199
We'll defend this position
to the last man.

196
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,909
What position?
This isn't a position, it's a trap.

197
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,868
The Russians will come from two sides
and you won't be able to get out.

198
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,474
We'll shoot back.
–With what?

199
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,631
We'll use flak as artillery.

200
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,759
The Russians will arrive with several
armies, tanks and heavy artillery.

201
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,232
Do you really think you'll
last even five minutes?

202
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,233
We have sworn it
to the Führer.

203
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,473
Don't you understand?
The war is lost. It's over.

204
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,874
Go away. Right now.

205
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,316
If you're still here when the Russians
arrive, you'll all be dead.

206
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:08,357
The 9th Army must retreat
or they'll be decimated...

207
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,838
The 9th Army will not retreat.
Busse must fight where he stands.

208
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,753
Führer, then the 9th Army is lost.

209
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:22,438
We'll push back the Soviet armies
in the north and east...

210
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,832
...with a ruthless, mighty attack.

211
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,070
With what units, mein Führer?

212
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,109
Steiner will attack from the north
and join the 9th Army.

213
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,598
The 9th Army is unable to move.

214
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,513
The enemy outnumbers us ten times.

215
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,831
Wenck's 12th Army must
support them.

216
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,313
The 12th Army is approaching the Elbe.
–Then it must turn around.

217
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,314
Then the western front would be open.
–Do you doubt my orders?

218
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,474
I think I've made myself clear.

219
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,430
I've reconciled myself to it.

220
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,477
I will remain in the capital.

221
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,590
It is neither possible nor
will it be permitted...

222
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,198
...for these cultureless
barbarians to conquer Europe.

223
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,272
I am the final bulwark against it.

224
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,991
The fight for Berlin
will decide the fate of Germany.

225
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,436
Only here can the moral victory
be gained.

226
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,878
If the Führer must die,
it will be in the ruins of Berlin.

227
00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:00,115
He owes it to world history.
His historical role must be played out here.

228
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,875
Mohnke, you're here.
–Mein Führer.

229
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,430
"Clausewitz" started today.
Berlin has become a front city.

230
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,196
You will be the commandant of the
Reichs Chancellery defense.

231
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,478
We'll fight until the last man in Berlin.

232
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,077
There are still three million civilians
here. They have to be evacuated.

233
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:34,316
I understand your concern, Mohnke.
But we have to be ice cold.

234
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,109
We cannot worry ourselves
for so-called citizens.

235
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,432
With all due respect, what will
happen to the women and children...

236
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,592
...and the thousands of wounded
and elderly?

237
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,799
In a war such as this,
there are no civilians.

238
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,918
The Führer has lost all
sense of reality.

239
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,038
He's moving divisions around
that no longer exist.

240
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,399
Steiner's group has been scattered,
yet Steiner must attack. Madness.

241
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,473
But why don't you tell him that?
–He doesn't listen to reason.

242
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,918
Something has to happen.
–Are you crazy? He'll throw us out.

243
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,073
We're soldiers.
We took an oath.

244
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,595
Does that mean we can't use
our own brains anymore?

245
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,309
And that's coming from you?
An opportunist? A ruthless careerist?

246
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,038
I beg your pardon?

247
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,268
Where were you?
–None of your business.

248
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,796
The most successful tank hunters of the
Berlin Hitler Youth stand before you.

249
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,077
I'm proud of you.

250
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,396
This boy took out two tanks
using anti-tank shells.

251
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,076
His name is Peter Kranz.
–So you're Peter.

252
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,554
I wish my generals were
as brave as you.

253
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,153
Good, good.

254
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,718
You've made history.

255
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,476
And when Germania rises
from these ruins...

256
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,279
...you will be the heroes.

257
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,595
Heil, to you.

258
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,911
I don't know about you,
but I prefer air raids.

259
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,632
What will happen to us?
–I could go if I wanted to.

260
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,590
But everybody is deserting him.
We can't all go, can we?

261
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,591
I can't go either.

262
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,677
I wouldn't know
where to go.

263
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,356
My parents and all
my friends warned me...

264
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,637
Don't get involved with the Nazis.

265
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,031
What should I say,
"Hello, I made a mistake"?

266
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,795
"When things went wrong,
I admitted my mistake."

267
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,997
Life will go on.

268
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,355
What do you think, Colonel?
–We have to go.

269
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,950
Where to?
–I don't know.

270
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,714
Wherever we're needed.

271
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,596
Let's go upstairs.
We'll party.

272
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,318
Come on.

273
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,473
Come, children.

274
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,869
We should have fun today.

275
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,958
Wherever the enemy goes,
all they'll find is destruction.

276
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,157
That's the death sentence
for the German people.

277
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,513
No power, no gas, no drinking
water, no coal, no transportation.

278
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,593
If you destroy all
the infrastructure...

279
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,479
...our country will go back
to the Middle Ages.

280
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,519
This order denies the people
any chance of survival.

281
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,310
If the war is lost, what does it matter
if the people are lost too?

282
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,396
The German people's primary needs of
life aren't important right now.

283
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,950
On the contrary,
we'd do best to destroy them ourselves.

284
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,958
Our people proved to be weak, and according
to the laws of nature, they should die out.

285
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,759
They're your people.
You're their Führer.

286
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,279
What remains after this battle...

287
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,797
...is only the inferior.
The superior will have fallen.

288
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,435
Come along.
You have to dance.

289
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,115
Care to dance, Fräulein Braun?
–I'd love to.

290
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,953
Excuse me?
–Of course.

291
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,872
What is it?

292
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,399
We have to leave Berlin, Eva.
You must convince him.

293
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,431
Or else, come with me.

294
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,392
You'll die.

295
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,510
Can somebody play some music?
I want to dance.

296
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,432
Dance.

297
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,438
Do you have a request?
–A swing.

298
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,113
Traudl.

299
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,112
It's all so unreal.

300
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:25,037
It's like a dream you
can't wake up from.

301
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,270
It keeps on going.

302
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,912
Gerda, I don't feel well.

303
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,231
Traudl, come.

304
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,950
I'm at my command post.

305
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,558
I did not move
my command post.

306
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,960
To the west? How so?

307
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,396
I'm 1000 meters from the enemy.
–General.

308
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,756
So, General?

309
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,230
I'm to be shot.
–What? Why?

310
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,190
They think I moved my
command post to the west.

311
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,716
Be sensible, General.
–Come with me.

312
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,673
Schenck.
–Mohnke.

313
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,994
I'm under the chancellery.
I'm commandant of its defense now.

314
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,199
I need aid.
–That will be difficult. Everything's gone.

315
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,158
My adjutant and I are
the only ones here.

316
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,550
You're a doctor, aren't you?
–Yes, an internist.

317
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,157
Commandeer a car and
bring all the medication...

318
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,153
...that you can find to me.

319
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,756
I'll do my best.
–Thanks. Hurry..

320
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,754
I must speak to the Führer.

321
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,474
About what?
–I'm to be shot.

322
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,077
Wait here.

323
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,672
Your weapons, please.

324
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,478
Not here.

325
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,309
Guard Post 2.
Understood.

326
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,752
General...

327
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,558
Not you.

328
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,671
What is this?
Why am I to be shot?

329
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,277
You know that any evasive maneuver
towards the west is forbidden.

330
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,275
Officers who don't obey
must be shot.

331
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,115
What do you mean?
My troops have been fighting for days.

332
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,717
My command post
is a kilometer from the front line.

333
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,110
Continue.

334
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,637
Do you see this?
I forbid you to take that tone with me.

335
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,956
And now, do whatever
you feel you must.

336
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,398
It's best if you tell this to the
Führer yourself. Come along.

337
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,918
You can't pass, Colonel.
–Orders from Brigade Führer Mohnke.

338
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,038
I have to get into the hospital.
We need medication.

339
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,998
There's nobody left.
They all took off.

340
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,038
And the wounded?
–How should I know?

341
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,350
I'm going to have a look.
You stay here.

342
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,593
Be very careful.
There are lots of Russians here.

343
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,073
See that? That's where the
Reich ends. Behind it is Russkie-Land.

344
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,997
May I?

345
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,510
He's damned stubborn.
Why doesn't he let me do that?

346
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,114
Am I supposed to tie him up?
What was I to do?

347
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,437
I'm disabled.
Do you want your son to be, too?

348
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,591
Don't shout at me like that.

349
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,799
He wanted to be part of the Hitler Youth.
Just like thousands of others.

350
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,032
He wants to defend himself,
and avenge himself.

351
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,476
Yes, look at me.
You make me shit.

352
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,236
You've suffered,
but you could fight.

353
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,995
We could do nothing
when it rained bombs.

354
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,311
We had only
our fear and our rage.

355
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,792
Arming children wasn't my idea.
The Führer said...

356
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,748
The Führer...
He's sent entire armies to their graves.

357
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,519
Now he lets children fight against two
million Russians. He's gone insane.

358
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,556
Coward.

359
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,110
Peter, stay there.
I want talk to you.

360
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,512
What would you have me do? Tell me.

361
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,831
My compliments.

362
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,879
I should have been back by now.
Are you sure the Führer still needs me?

363
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,112
Drink.
–Führer's orders.

364
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,590
You made a big impression
on the Führer.

365
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,990
But you don't think Steiner
will attack, do you?

366
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,391
I doubt whether Steiner
is able to do anything...

367
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,358
...but you probably know that
better than I do.

368
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,149
If Steiner doesn't attack,
Berlin is lost.

369
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,598
The Führer was impressed
with your report.

370
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,151
He puts you in command of
the defense of Berlin.

371
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,633
I'd have preferred to
be shot.

372
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,792
Fall back.

373
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,430
Let them get closer.

374
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,635
Tank alert.

375
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,155
Easy. Wait, kid.
They're still too far.

376
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,594
Stay in the bunker, ladies.

377
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,235
Is that German artillery I hear?
–I'm afraid not.

378
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,073
But hasn't Steiner's
attack started?

379
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,758
You have to go as fast as you can.
Time is running out.

380
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,639
But the Führer has
the situation under control.

381
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,075
Steiner's attack will make
all the difference.

382
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,835
The Führer says it will change
military history.

383
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,754
Everybody but the Führer knows
that's a fantasy.

384
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,273
I wonder if he even believes it himself.
–Why would he play games?

385
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,192
What does he have to lose?

386
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,998
I don't believe a word of it.

387
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,358
The enemy has made a breakthrough.

388
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,479
They took Zossen and are advancing
towards Stahnsdorf.

389
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,349
They're at the city's northern border,
between Frohnau and Pankow.

390
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,640
In the east, they've reached
Lichtenberg, Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst.

391
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,429
When Steiner attacks,
everything will be alright.

392
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,316
Mein Führer...

393
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,510
Steiner...

394
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,358
Steiner didn't have sufficient forces.

395
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,159
The attack did not happen.

396
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,351
The following stay in the room:
Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

397
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:41,517
That was an order.
Steiner's attack was an order.

398
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,310
How dare you
ignore my orders?

399
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,558
Is this what it's come to?

400
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:56,720
The military, everybody lied
to me. Even the SS.

401
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,398
The generals are no more than
a bunch of disloyal cowards.

402
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,994
I can't allow that...

403
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:10,109
Cowards, traitors and incompetents.
–Mein Führer, that's outrageous.

404
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,955
The generals are the scum
of the German people.

405
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,953
No sense of honor.

406
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,750
You call yourself General because
you spent years at the academy...

407
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,992
...where you only learned
to use knife and fork.

408
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,472
For years, the military
obstructed me.

409
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:34,316
All you ever did is
thwart me.

410
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,597
I should have had...

411
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,675
...all the high officers executed.
Like Stalin did.

412
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,913
I never went to the academy.

413
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:56,428
But I conquered all
of Europe on my own.

414
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,352
Traitors.

415
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:07,594
I've been betrayed and deceived
from the start.

416
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,595
Such enormous betrayal
of the German people.

417
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:18,596
But all these traitors will pay.
With their own blood.

418
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,433
They'll drown
in their own blood.

419
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,516
Calm down, Gerda.

420
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,949
All my orders have
been ignored.

421
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,790
How can I be a leader
under these circumstances?

422
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,270
It's over.

423
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,433
The war is lost.

424
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,388
But if you think this means
I'll leave Berlin...

425
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:06,076
...you're mistaken. I'd rather
shoot a bullet through my head.

426
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,310
Do what you want.

427
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,074
The Führer wasn't serious about
shooting himself, was he?

428
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,913
Frau Junge, Frau Christian.

429
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,755
Get changed. In one hour,
a plane will take you south.

430
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,434
Everything is lost.

431
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,319
Hopelessly lost.

432
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,719
You know I'll stay with you.
You can't send me away.

433
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,515
Mein Führer, I'm staying too.

434
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,511
What now?

435
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,989
Time for this charade to end.

436
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,551
Do you want us to stop fighting?
That's inconceivable.

437
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,714
The Führer doesn't want us to capitulate.
No more November 1918. Ever.

438
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,317
But he doesn't want to be in charge
anymore. He said "Do what you want."

439
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,631
Nobody can replace him.
The Führer is the Führer.

440
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,519
The Führer's confused.
He'll recover.

441
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,717
Great.
And then what?

442
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,390
No capitulation. That was
never his intention.

443
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,757
We owe it to him.
–Hollow phrases.

444
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,434
We have to act now,
or it will be too late.

445
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,910
You're only looking after yourself.
–Mind your words.

446
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,758
Damn.

447
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,432
We'll never get out of here alive.
It's all over.

448
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,033
We've got to wait.

449
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,795
Even the Führer doesn't believe in it
anymore. What will happen to us?

450
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,795
Günsche says there's a tunnel
that goes under the Russian lines.

451
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,838
Why did you say
you wanted to stay with him?

452
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,039
I don't know.
Honestly.

453
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,831
Will we ever be able to
buy bread again?

454
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,313
At the bakery, like before?

455
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,633
It stopped.
Let's go for a walk.

456
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,593
Traudl.

457
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,830
Look here.

458
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,758
Ah, children, I'm lighting another one.

459
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,476
Let's go down again.

460
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:57,559
You know that statue outside?
It would look good in my garden, by the pond.

461
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,632
Will you buy it for me
if we get out of here?

462
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,157
My dear, I don't know who owns
that statue.

463
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:10,678
It's state property, certainly.
I can't put it in a private garden.

464
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,595
If you manage to escape Berlin,
surely you can make a small exception.

465
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,352
Female logic.

466
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,433
You're very dirty.
You can't wear this coat anymore.

467
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,115
You don't have to walk
around like some old man.

468
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,111
This is my work uniform.

469
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:33,628
I can't be see apronless, my
colored pencils in disarray.

470
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,272
Mommy.

471
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,748
Ammunition. Fast.

472
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,913
Where's the medic?

473
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,792
Where did they come from?
–Volkssturm. Drafted this afternoon.

474
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,997
They have to get
out of the field of fire.

475
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,515
The Volkssturm is under the
direct command of Dr. Goebbels.

476
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,953
I want them out of here.
This is insane.

477
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,951
I'll take the responsibility.

478
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,797
I think this is wrong.
–Great.

479
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,595
Stop. Lights out.

480
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,432
Stop. Stay where you are.

481
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,517
Stay where you are.
–Alright, Germans.

482
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,678
Help. They want to kill us.
–What is all this?

483
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,355
A <i>Greifkommando.</i>
–You're kidding.

484
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:20,194
Stop it.
Let those men go.

485
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,557
What's this?
–You have no authority here.

486
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:28,714
These men are fugitives.
Traitors are shot.

487
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,078
They're old men. Civilians.
You can't do this.

488
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,474
Who's going to stop me?
You maybe?

489
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,396
Stop it. That's enough.

490
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,313
Dismissed.

491
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,798
This man's a doctor.

492
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,110
Can you operate?
–Not really.

493
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,438
Don't let the children
take too many toys.

494
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,149
And not too many pajamas.
They're no longer needed.

495
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,630
Herr Minister...
–Frau Junge, my family will arrive soon.

496
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:08,351
Can you look after them for a moment?
Thank you.

497
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,192
Brigade Führer, what can I do for you?

498
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,397
Your Volkssturm is easy prey
for the Russians.

499
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,836
They have neither combat experience
nor good weapons.

500
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,154
Their unconditional belief
in the final victory makes up for that.

501
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,598
Herr Minister, without weapons
those men can't fight.

502
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,751
Their deaths will be pointless.

503
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,957
I don't pity them.

504
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,560
I repeat:
I don't pity them.

505
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,951
The people called this
upon themselves.

506
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,398
This may come as a surprise to you,
but have no illusion.

507
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:47,030
We didn't force the people.
They gave us a mandate.

508
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,317
And now their little necks
are being snapped.

509
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,479
Eva, you have to leave the Führer.

510
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,029
Don't be stupid.
This is about life and death.

511
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,839
How can you say that?
Where are you?

512
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,912
I decided
not to die in Berlin.

513
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:23,313
Does my sister know where you are?
–Think about it. I'll call you back.

514
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,359
Children, your room is to the right.

515
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,231
Wait for me.

516
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,590
Hello, Frau Goebbels.
–Good to see you, Frau Junge.

517
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,715
Line up, children.

518
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,440
Helga, come. Line up.

519
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,916
Let's make ourselves look good and
then we'll go say hello to Uncle Hitler.

520
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,715
Do you remember the song?

521
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,639
I agree.
If we don't amputate, he'll die.

522
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,320
Give yourself room to work.

523
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,995
Cut down to the artery.

524
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,593
Be brave, colleague.

525
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,751
Take hold of the artery.

526
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,111
Clamp it.

527
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,111
Saw.

528
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,836
The best thing to do is
shoot yourself in the mouth.

529
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,435
Then your skull explodes.

530
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,554
You won't feel a thing.
You'll be dead immediately.

531
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,598
I want to be a beautiful corpse.
I'll take poison.

532
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,309
If I have to die,
at least let it be painless.

533
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,357
That's definitely painless.

534
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:51,036
It paralyses the nervous system
and the respiratory system.

535
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,714
A matter of seconds.

536
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,031
Can I have one too?
–Me too.

537
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,431
Himmler supplied me well.

538
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,551
Thank you.

539
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:32,235
I would have liked to give you
a nicer present.

540
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,311
Berlin, April 23 1945.

541
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:52,518
My dear little sister, I'm sorry
to write this to you.

542
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,629
But such is how it is. It could
be over any moment.

543
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,190
First of all: Hermann isn't with us.

544
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,909
But I'm sure
you'll see him again.

545
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:10,598
He'll get through this
and fight on from Bavaria.

546
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,753
The Führer has lost all hope
of a positive outcome.

547
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,713
Dear son, I don't know
if you will receive this letter.

548
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:25,159
Maybe someone will allow me
to send you a last greeting.

549
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,835
I stayed with dad
against his will.

550
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,356
Last Sunday, the Führer
wanted to help me escape.

551
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,432
But you know your mother.
We have the same blood.

552
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:39,229
I won't even think about it.
Our ideology is
going down the drain...

553
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:44,838
...and with it, everything that made
life beautiful and worthwhile.

554
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,755
A world without the Führer and National
Socialism is not worth living in.

555
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,798
That is why I brought
the children, too.

556
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,349
They are too good for the
life that awaits them.

557
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,594
God will have mercy on me
if I bring them redemption myself.

558
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,871
I'll wear my bracelet with the green
stone until the very end.

559
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:17,398
After that, I want
you to always wear it.

560
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,359
Unfortunately, my diamond watch
is with the watchmaker.

561
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:27,310
I've included the address below.
I hope you're lucky enough to get it.

562
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,596
I want you to have it.

563
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,672
You'll also get the bracelet
with the topaz pendant.

564
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,593
A birthday present
from the Führer.

565
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,269
I owe some money
to the Heise company.

566
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:48,470
There may be more debts, but
no more than 1500 Reichsmarks.

567
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:55,914
All correspondence with
the Führer must be burned.

568
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:04,478
I'm sending you some food and tobacco.
Also, the coffee is for Lindner and Kathl.

569
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:09,919
The cigarettes are for Mandi, the tobacco
for dad, the chocolate for mom.

570
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:14,437
I can't think of anything else.
That's it for today.

571
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,388
Dear sister, I wish
you lots of happiness.

572
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:23,189
And remember,
you will see Hermann again.

573
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:27,194
The warmest regards
and a kiss from...

574
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,191
...your sister.

575
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,230
Peter.

576
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,350
I brought some bread.

577
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,959
I have to go, dad. They need me.
–Stay here.

578
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,792
Let me go.
–Easy, boy.

579
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,839
Let him go.
The Führer needs everyone.

580
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,788
I'm tired of your bullshit.
–Wilhelm.

581
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,951
What did you say?

582
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,758
Kiss my ass.

583
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,277
They should hang you.
With somebody like you we'd make short work.

584
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,119
Let's go get some water.
–There's no water here.

585
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,910
Then we'll have to go outside and look.
–Are you drunk?

586
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,833
Come on, hero. I'll protect you.

587
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,797
Inge.

588
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,275
Give me that gun.

589
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,431
Give it here.

590
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:24,555
I don't fight against children.

591
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,593
Berlin is not really
as bad off as it seems.

592
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:37,517
The divisions must be kept intact.
Supplement them with civilians if necessary.

593
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:43,232
If we stop the Soviets here,
the whole world will be taken aback.

594
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,595
If it's really true...

595
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:51,949
...that there are rifts between
the Allies, and that happens...

596
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,078
...then a reversal is possible...

597
01:04:55,240 --> 01:05:01,315
...and I can deliver a blow to the head
of this insatiable Bolshevik colossus.

598
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,029
If I'm successful here,
and save the capital...

599
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:10,112
...then the world will realize
that only one man is capable...

600
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:14,558
...of stopping the Bolsheviks.

601
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,280
And that is me.

602
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:24,198
If I win this battle, then it's not
for personal honor and glory.

603
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,390
But for history.

604
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:32,270
If all goes well, perfect. In the opposite
case, Europe will become Bolshevik.

605
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:37,798
And in five years, the Führer and
National Socialism will become legendary.

606
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,793
Sanctified by the last great battle.

607
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:46,830
Everything that the world reproaches
us for will be swept aside.

608
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:51,199
Only here in Berlin
can everything still be saved.

609
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:55,672
Each last man must be utilized.
That is our duty.

610
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:40,274
Grand Admiral Dönitz will be happy to learn
that things are so well with the Führer.

611
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,238
Such energy.
–It's a miracle.

612
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,550
He is and remains the Führer.

613
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:50,840
And just yesterday there were rumors
that he'd succumbed to depression.

614
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,390
You said it yourself: rumors.

615
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:59,149
The V2 will ensure
a reversal of the situation.

616
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:03,074
Their range must be enormous.
When will they be ready?

617
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:06,949
I can't say anything.
It's a strict secret.

618
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,350
Naturally. Excuse me.

619
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,035
Here I am.

620
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,712
Got you.

621
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,836
Excuse us.
–It's nothing.

622
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,594
Go play upstairs.

623
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,830
General Field Marshal,
the Führer would like to speak with you.

624
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:53,310
Listen, Keitel.
I want you to leave tonight.

625
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:57,598
Go to Dönitz and help him
get everything organized.

626
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,275
Things have to be
started up again.

627
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,550
I don't understand you.

628
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,554
We have no more oil fields.
That's catastrophic.

629
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:14,078
It makes any serious operation
impossible.

630
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:20,395
Once everything is settled here,
we must recover our oil fields.

631
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,472
Any other questions?
–No, mein Führer.

632
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,871
Good.
Have a good trip.

633
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,997
Fritz.

634
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,516
Martha.

635
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:56,557
The operator is dead and the entire
Army press service has left.

636
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,312
Frau Junge, bring this
to Herr Bormann. It's urgent.

637
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,471
Bad news?

638
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,799
This has just come in.
–Thank you very much, Frau Junge.

639
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,476
A dispatch from Göring.

640
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,078
He writes:

641
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:46,232
Mein Führer,
based on your decision...

642
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,710
...to remain in Berlin,
do you agree...

643
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,555
...that I thereby take command...

644
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,598
...with complete freedom of action?

645
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:02,596
If I receive no reply by 2200 hours,
I'll assume you have been incapacitated.

646
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,638
I will then act on behalf
of the country and the Fatherland.

647
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,079
That's high treason.
And betrayal of you.

648
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:13,198
Göring's concerns are not
entirely unjustified.

649
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,830
If our communication
system fails...

650
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,992
...we'll be cut off
from the outside world.

651
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,469
We won't be able
to issue orders anymore.

652
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,598
I think Göring wants
to seize power.

653
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,435
I never trusted his clique
at Obersalzberg.

654
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,670
This looks like a coup.

655
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,118
That failure. That parasite.

656
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:39,078
Parvenu. Sluggard.

657
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:44,314
How dare he say
I'm incapacitated?

658
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:48,234
Hello.
–Herr Speer. How did you get into Berlin?

659
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,472
It wasn't easy,
but I must speak with the Führer.

660
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,358
If I were you,
I'd wait a bit.

661
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:57,957
The Luftwaffe.
What has he done to it?

662
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:01,430
For that alone,
he should be executed.

663
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:07,470
That morphine addict
corrupted the country.

664
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,200
And now this.

665
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,397
He betrays me.

666
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,598
Me of all people.

667
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:28,509
I want Göring stripped
of his power, immediately.

668
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,558
And, in case I don't
survive the war...

669
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:35,349
...he's to be
executed immediately.

670
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:41,709
What's going to happen to us?
Is there any hope left?

671
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,637
Frau Junge, leave here
before it's too late.

672
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,157
The Führer is staying.
We can't leave him behind, can we?

673
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:56,713
He doesn't need anybody for what
awaits him. Least of all you.

674
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:01,831
But Herr Goebbels and his wife
are staying. And the children.

675
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,316
But the children...

676
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,110
I always thought...

677
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,756
...that there was a way out.

678
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,072
Warmer, warmer, warmer...

679
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,276
Hot.

680
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,832
Look, Heide.
–It's beautiful.

681
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,198
Uncle Albert.

682
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,795
Uncle Albert, won't you stay with us?
–I can't, Helga. I have work to do.

683
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,838
You can work here too.

684
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:26,356
Good evening, Herr Speer.
–Frau Christian. Are you
running a kindergarten now?

685
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,272
Mom is sick.

686
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,670
What does she have?
–I don't know.

687
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,718
The doctor wants her to stay in bed.

688
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:37,873
Herr minister,
Frau Braun would like to speak with you.

689
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,795
Good luck.

690
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:47,673
See you soon, children.
–See you soon.

691
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,439
Who wants some apple juice?
–Me.

692
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:59,078
Tell Frau Braun that I'll be by.

693
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,998
Come in.

694
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,113
Albert. Hello.

695
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,876
You have a fever.

696
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,316
Albert, I can't take
it anymore.

697
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,553
Why don't you leave with
the children, Magda?

698
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,154
Leave?
And go where?

699
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:41,235
I can arrange a barge to
take you to Schwanenwerder.

700
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:47,077
You can hide
until everything's over.

701
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,708
I've thought about it.

702
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:56,035
My children can't grow up in
a world without National Socialism.

703
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:04,758
Think about it some more. The
children have a right to a future.

704
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:12,309
If National Socialism dies,
there will be no future.

705
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:31,077
I can't believe
you really want that.

706
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,913
Go.

707
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:39,476
I'll come by again
before I leave.

708
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,477
Come in.

709
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,874
I knew you'd come.

710
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,998
You wouldn't desert
the Führer.

711
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:27,548
I've come to say goodbye to the Führer.
I'm going back to Hamburg tonight.

712
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,518
Of course, you must go.
Sit down.

713
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:36,389
I brought some furniture
you designed.

714
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,835
I couldn't leave it behind.

715
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,869
Please, you must've
not eaten all day.

716
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,792
That's true.

717
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:55,436
It's very important that you came.
It shows him you're on his side.

718
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,556
Did he ever doubt that?

719
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,752
Lately, he often thought
you were against him too.

720
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:06,196
I always said you'd come
and here you are.

721
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,873
I think he liked it that you
advised him to stay in Berlin.

722
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,031
I think it's best, too.

723
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,997
And, you know...

724
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,679
...it may sound strange...

725
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:32,590
...but I'm really happy here.
And I'm not afraid.

726
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,116
Herr Speer...

727
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,351
The Führer...

728
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,791
When you speak with him...

729
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:07,633
There's the question of whether we'll
remain here, or fly to Berchtesgaden.

730
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:12,715
Advise him to leave, Herr Speer.
He listens to you.

731
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:19,831
Persuade him that if we don't leave Berlin,
the Bolsheviks will cut our throat.

732
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:48,990
So, you came.
–Mein Führer, I...

733
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,832
It's OK.

734
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,116
Let's sit down.

735
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:16,192
I had great plans
for the Germans and the world.

736
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:22,678
Nobody understood me.
Not even my old brothers in arms.

737
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:32,270
The opportunities we had.
The whole world was ours to grab.

738
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,752
Too late.

739
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,636
I can be proud only...

740
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,873
for openly fighting the Jews...

741
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:53,750
...and for cleansing the <i>Lebensraum</i>
of the Jewish poison.

742
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:03,392
I don't find it hard to go on.
One brief moment...

743
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,798
...and then eternal peace.

744
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,831
But please spare the people,
mein Führer.

745
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:24,478
If my people cannot endure
this ordeal...

746
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,757
...I won't shed a tear.

747
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,956
They get what they deserve.

748
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:35,956
They brought this fate
upon themselves.

749
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,154
For months...

750
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,470
...I have to tell you this...

751
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,399
...for months I've sabotaged
your orders for destruction.

752
01:21:53,240 --> 01:22:00,191
I not only ignored your orders,
but even acted against them.

753
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,676
I had to tell you.

754
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:19,476
My personal loyalty to you
has never wavered.

755
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,189
So you're leaving.

756
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,631
Good.

757
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,552
Goodbye.

758
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,276
I wish you all the best.

759
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,032
Come in.

760
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,317
The very best.

761
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:48,911
Eat as so much as
you can, gentlemen.

762
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,191
Peter.

763
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,430
It's alright, son.

764
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,396
He has a fever.

765
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,958
Yes, but he's alive.

766
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:27,235
If God wants to do
someone a favor

767
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:31,075
He sends him out into the world

768
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,869
gives him a bite to eat

769
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:39,079
and then sends him to a sausage factory.

770
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:51,475
The lazy ones who lie in bed

771
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:55,189
are not invigorated by the dawn.

772
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,239
They know only of rocking cradles,

773
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:03,313
of worries, burden, need and bread.

774
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:07,268
The streams gush in the mountains.

775
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:11,149
Larks flutter in the air.

776
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:15,029
Why would I not sing along

777
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:19,159
loudly and from full breast?

778
01:26:20,305 --> 01:26:26,630
