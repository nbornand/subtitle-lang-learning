2
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,846
It's okay, son ...

3
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,357
I know you want this to be over.

4
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:23,105
I'm right here.

5
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:29,496
I will be right here ...

6
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,108
But, you don't give up.

7
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,090
You hear me?

8
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:52,652
As long as you can still grab
a breath, you fight.

9
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:56,535
You breathe ...
Keep breathing.

10
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:45,808
Hawk.

11
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:13,950
Calm.

12
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:33,990
Oh shit!

13
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:38,606
God damn sons of bitches.

14
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:42,859
God shit me more.

15
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:50,939
- Hey you seen Coulter?
- No.

16
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:57,215
Listen up! When them pelts is clean...

17
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,042
I want you to wrap 'em up real tight.

18
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,542
Remember, we're not doin' no
15 pelt bales...

19
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:04,928
We're doin' 30 pelt bales.

20
00:05:04,953 --> 00:05:05,738
- Fitzgerald.

21
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,073
- Captain.
- Where are we with the haul?

22
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:10,687
What are you thinking?

23
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,859
Well...

24
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,882
I'm thinkin' whatever it is that
they're hunting out there...

25
00:05:14,902 --> 00:05:16,950
I'm hoping they don't need another shot.

26
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:18,857
Let's make sure we're
at ahead out by dawn.

27
00:05:18,992 --> 00:05:20,315
We've been done by this morning.

28
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:22,643
I don't like to be not here myself
by now, but you know we're not.

29
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:23,705
We men are to tired.

30
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:26,244
I figure we're only few days out
from the Fort, we're traped out.

31
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:27,582
All we have to worry about is...

32
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,114
...getting some fresh meat for the boys.
- Yeah.

33
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,379
Yeah, you seen Coulter?

34
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:36,975
- Hey, we took down an elk.

35
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:38,393
A big one.

36
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:41,147
We're gonna need some help
to haul the meat back.

37
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,063
You let me know when it's on the spit.

38
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:44,350
- I'll help you with it then.

39
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:45,941
Hey no, come on fellas...
I need your help.

40
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:48,709
We needed help when we were
bustin' are asses loadin' them bales.

41
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:51,617
I've been out here so long eating
this damn beaver meat...

42
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:53,942
I'm actually starting to
miss my wifes cooking.

43
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:56,008
Shit, I'm actually startin'
to miss your wife.

44
00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:57,268
Why don't you shut the hell?

45
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,255
- Help.

46
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:01,670
- Is that Coulter?

47
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:04,086
- Stay together.
- Jim, you go get the Captain.

48
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:05,750
Jesus Christ!

49
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:07,249
- Shut up!
- Help him!

50
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:12,454
- Anybody seeing them?
- Stay quiet dammit...

51
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:18,736
God damn.

52
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:26,088
What was that?

53
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,066
Pa?

54
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:35,208
Let's go.

55
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:58,499
They got Thomas.

56
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:24,489
I can't see 'em.

57
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:31,509
- Get down.
- Oh shit.

58
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:32,516
They are everywhere.

59
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:33,415
We are surrounded.

60
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:35,863
- They're everywhere.
- Soho ...

61
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:37,361
Stay here.

62
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:39,545
No, no. Oh no!

63
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,382
Stay down.
- Help me!

64
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,625
They want us out in the open ...

65
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:51,042
Someone get up the hill!

66
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,637
Nobody move, just stay where you are.

67
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,211
Well they want the pelts.

68
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:57,916
We go and get on them 'bout right now ...

69
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,048
...or we gonna lose it all.

70
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:19,172
Get to the boat.
To the boat, son.

71
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:21,674
Move, move, move.

72
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:28,225
Leave the forest,
leave the forest ...

73
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:29,383
...to the boat.

74
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,974
Hawk!

75
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:05,640
Hawk, hawk!

76
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,364
Grab some pelts!

77
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,333
Come on, grab the pelt!

78
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,371
Grab the pelt.

79
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:00,077
Come on.

80
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:02,269
Come on.

81
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,061
Get this to my little girl.
You're coming with us I'm gettin' help ...

82
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:35,308
Lean on me, just get ...

83
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:39,812
Glass!

84
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:41,060
Get to the boat!

85
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:04,533
You fuckin' son of a ...

86
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,294
Get on the fuckin' boat.

87
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:19,122
Help.

88
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:25,537
Move, come on.

89
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:30,238
Come on.

90
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:32,831
- Cut the rope.

91
00:11:33,414 --> 00:11:34,213
Cut the rope.
- Wait for Amos, wait for Amos...

92
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:37,137
We go now.

93
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:39,305
Go to the cannon.

94
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:52,350
Don't leave, please.

95
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:40,473
My daughter, Powaqa, is not here.

96
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:43,104
Collect all the pelts we can carry.

97
00:12:43,747 --> 00:12:46,915
We'll trade pelts with French for horses

98
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,957
...and keep searching for her.

99
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:55,623
And the dust becomes flower...

100
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:56,585
Amen.

101
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,423
When the morning was clear...

102
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:04,460
Amen.

103
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:18,625
Ready?

104
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,689
Hold still.

105
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:29,215
Where did you learn that?

106
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,291
My father was a doctor.

107
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:32,174
- Bridger.

108
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,571
- Captain we got a small
tree niggers out here ...

109
00:13:34,595 --> 00:13:36,037
...waiting to finish the job.

110
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:37,326
- Hold there.
- Yes.

111
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,859
Tell me you got some kind of plan.

112
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:48,522
Glass.

113
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,390
Missouri is no good.

114
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,900
Not while the Rees runnin' it.

115
00:13:54,969 --> 00:13:56,586
We got to get off this boat ...

116
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,236
Oh you want to get off the boat?

117
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,677
Then what we're gonna do, hah?

118
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,787
We're gonna take our furs...

119
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:06,376
And sit out there amongst the Ree,
like a bunch of god damn ducks.

120
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:09,142
Only safe thing to do is
track a new course ...

121
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,277
...back upon land.

122
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:11,591
We'll add weeks to the trip.

123
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:13,871
Better then floating back down there
where they can get their eyes on us.

124
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,109
They got eyes on you right now, son.

125
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:20,045
What I'm saying is we stay on the boat.

126
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:22,761
Try the course toward the Fort ...

127
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,639
We take the chances on the water.

128
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,384
Glass knows this territory better
than the rest of us put together.

129
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,192
It's his job to get us home safe.

130
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:30,572
- Get us home safe?
- Yeah.

131
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,036
- Need I remind you we already lost 32 men?

132
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,987
- 33 now.

133
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:36,481
They were my men Fitzgerald,
i know how many I lost.

134
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:40,028
We do like Glass says,
that's the end of it.

135
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,165
We have to set the boat loose.

136
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:58,466
If Ree are tracking us, they will
find it down the river.

137
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:01,110
The best course is hike in on
the ground and follow it down...

138
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,520
...to Fort Kahowa.

139
00:15:02,547 --> 00:15:03,638
- What, on foot?
- Are you sure?

140
00:15:04,056 --> 00:15:05,805
It'd be a week before we get there.

141
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:08,353
Unless we come across a poach
straying prison horses.

142
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:09,908
Ain't no poach that far over.

143
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:11,384
Right, Captain.

144
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:13,900
Losing this boat is god damn stinking.

145
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:15,989
Besides the Ree ain't that stupid ...

146
00:15:16,063 --> 00:15:18,793
If we keep it, we can lay
it up around hours peak.

147
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,879
Quit acting like you know what
you're talking about Fitzgerald.

148
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,076
Ain't nobody talking to you.

149
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:24,031
Who'd listen to you anyway.

150
00:15:24,232 --> 00:15:27,565
God damn, can't even find
the way fuckin... potato shit...

151
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:28,459
All I'm sayin' is ...

152
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:30,720
...Camp Roollin is just up away.

153
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:32,392
And we can hold up there.

154
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:34,536
We walk.

155
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:37,120
Yeah, I'm sure we will.

156
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:42,522
God damn, wish my daddy was a doctor then
he could have bought me a Captains job.

157
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:43,988
So what do we do now?

158
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:46,956
Praying that poach ain't rockin'
if we ever get back here...

159
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,966
...to pick them up.
- Make sure to mark this place.

160
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:51,314
We're leaving a fortune
under these rocks.

161
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:53,490
No more room here, you
gotta move up the hill.

162
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:55,538
- Glass. Chart a course.

163
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:57,880
Try as you can figure to
get us around the Ree.

164
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:58,825
- Yes sir.

165
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:03,769
- This ain't right, this ain't right.

166
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:07,538
We all know that this furs ain't won't
be here by the time we come back.

167
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:09,359
There is no way we can hold
them all the way back...

168
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:10,261
...to the fort.

169
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:12,309
Not the way we're going,
besides Arikara is...

170
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,715
...spread all through their territory,
we want to go with our hands free.

171
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,493
I'm tryin' to tell you're gonna
lose this pelts.

172
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,290
- Would you rather hold on to
the pelts or your life?

173
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:19,224
Life?

174
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:22,038
What life you talking about?
I ain't got no life.

175
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:25,625
I just got livin' the only way I get
to do that is through this pelts.

176
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:28,506
Fuck!

177
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,341
Calm there Fitz.

178
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:33,811
Make a way, I'm going home ...

179
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:36,519
After six months working my ass
of like a mule,

180
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,250
risking my neck ...

181
00:16:38,274 --> 00:16:40,015
...men dying and for what?

182
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:41,700
Damn nearly lost everything.

183
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:43,439
This job's been fucked from the start.

184
00:16:44,823 --> 00:16:46,454
There is the one being fuckin' us.

185
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:50,866
Any of you boys wonder how Ree
managed to get their drop on us

186
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,031
...for Mr. Glass here,

187
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:54,208
was supposed to be looking out
for that fucking thing.

188
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:58,509
All them Pawnee buddies of his.
- Pawnees as much against rees as the rest of us.

189
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,397
Yeah?

190
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,424
What about his little...

191
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:04,213
...half-breed son?

192
00:17:05,128 --> 00:17:07,519
And what kind of savage you think
his momma was.

193
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:08,971
Lay of the boy Fitz.

194
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,458
All I'm saying here.

195
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:14,589
Savage is savage ...

196
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:23,865
Hey Glass.

197
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:28,470
Is it true what they say?
That you shootin' a lieutenant ...

198
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,214
while you was living
with them savages?

199
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:31,319
Fitzgerald.

200
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:37,360
21 dead soldiers, more than
40 dead feather necks...

201
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:39,474
but you and your boy are the only
ones to get walk out alive.

202
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:41,491
It was kind of a miracle,
don't you think?

203
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:42,974
You need to shut up Fitzgerald.

204
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:46,151
Is that what you did?

205
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:48,766
Shot one of your own to save
this little dog right here?

206
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,313
- Shut up.
- You want to fight son?

207
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,821
You were playing with
this little boy's momma?

208
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,887
- Fitzgerald!
- Need to kill her?

209
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:58,730
Hey you can quit polishing that rifle,
while I'm talking to you.

210
00:17:59,636 --> 00:18:00,738
I'm working on it.

211
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:03,562
You can work on it later
when I'm done talking to you.

212
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:05,987
- Look at me scalp.
- That's enough!

213
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:09,352
You're forgettin' your place boy.

214
00:18:11,153 --> 00:18:14,954
As far as I can tell my place is right
here, on the smart end of this rifle.

215
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:17,055
You move along Fitzgerald.

216
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:20,278
That's an order.

217
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:21,842
Listen to me.

218
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:23,995
We only have a couple hours of light left.

219
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,123
We gotta stash these pelts ...

220
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,664
...and get rid of the boat, let's go.

221
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:27,906
Yes, Captain.

222
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:32,291
I told you to be invisible, son.

223
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:34,186
- At least ...
- If you want to survive keep your...

224
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,930
...mouth shut.

225
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:40,709
- At least he heard me ...
- They don't hear your voice!

226
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:42,803
They just see the color of your face.

227
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:44,862
You understand?

228
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:47,234
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

229
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:54,080
You have to listen to me, son.

230
00:18:54,888 --> 00:18:56,383
You have to listen.

231
00:19:09,671 --> 00:19:10,892
Beckett.

232
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:13,462
Weston.

233
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,181
Why are they not jumping?

234
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,838
It looks like they changed their minds.

235
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:25,893
Smart sons of bitches.

236
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:28,158
Smart ...

237
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:36,626
I ought to be on that boat.

238
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:41,930
You did the right thing.

239
00:19:59,045 --> 00:20:00,312
It's time to move.

240
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:02,501
Get up.

241
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,780
We're headed out.

242
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:09,106
I'm coming.

243
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:14,368
It's better you lay down.

244
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:18,752
When the rest of the men are
ready you send them to me.

245
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,355
I'm going west.

246
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,418
You are my son.

247
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,580
You are my son.

248
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:55,478
There are only two here.

249
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:57,178
Powaqa is not here.

250
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:01,804
The others probably took her.

251
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,548
They went north.

252
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:09,777
We'll pick up their tracks
on the mountain.

253
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:19,192
Was it the right decision ...

254
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:20,605
...leaving the boat?

255
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,169
Ree own that river.

256
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,168
Would have flanked us.

257
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:28,092
If we stay east to the ground
to those mountains ...

258
00:21:28,116 --> 00:21:30,005
...we cut a week of our trip.

259
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:32,351
Land is all dry up there,
nothing for the Ree to hunt.

260
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,239
- Except us?
- Except us.

261
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,839
Is it true what Fitzgerald said?

262
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:49,879
Is that why you came out here
to the edge of the world?

263
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,836
- Glass?
I didn't like the quiet.

264
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,179
Your boy, he's seen alot ...

265
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:04,726
He got a mother you need
to get him back to?

266
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:08,686
Glass!?
Hey there are cubs here.

267
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:09,757
Glass!

268
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:13,647
We got cubs here.

269
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:19,529
Christ almighty.

270
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,201
Hey you.

271
00:29:23,002 --> 00:29:23,938
Hey!

272
00:29:24,027 --> 00:29:25,593
He's down here.

273
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:29,168
- Help me out...
- Keep your eyes open, if the bear's alive.

274
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:31,072
Come on, I need your help now.

275
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,176
Glass.

276
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:35,968
Oh my god!

277
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,349
- Oh Christ!
- Captain.

278
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:40,549
Give me rags now!

279
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:42,771
Push where he bleeds out.

280
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:45,995
Prepare the kit.

281
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:48,212
Bridger, you hold that.

282
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:50,834
- Easy.
- Oh god!

283
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:53,936
- Gotta give him credit for taking
that grizz down with him.

284
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,346
He shouldn't have fire
the shot, the whole

285
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:56,886
place is crawling with
fucking tree niggers...

286
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,097
- Hey that's enough, that's enough!

287
00:30:00,336 --> 00:30:01,679
- We're still on Ree territory here ...

288
00:30:01,773 --> 00:30:03,642
This is one of our own men, god dammit.

289
00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:07,174
- The boy leave him, just
got a circle around us.

290
00:30:07,198 --> 00:30:09,071
North and west, take those two with you.

291
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:11,294
Bill, Fryman you take south and east.

292
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,588
Watch for anyone that might
have heard that shot.

293
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,601
- Yes sir.
- We have to stitch him up.

294
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,106
What about me?

295
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:19,069
It's alright.

296
00:30:19,141 --> 00:30:20,353
You have to...
- You stay here.

297
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,959
Hold it down.
- I'm sorry Mr. Glass. I am so sorry.

298
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,178
- Bridger, hold him.
Press down here.

299
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:28,761
He is bleeding down here too.

300
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,967
Torturing the bastard.

301
00:30:32,676 --> 00:30:36,595
The proper thing to do would be though...
Finish him off quick.

302
00:30:37,498 --> 00:30:39,594
Unless he has a chance of pulling through.

303
00:30:42,044 --> 00:30:45,792
Pullin' thru? You saw what
that grizz did to him.

304
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:47,813
He'll be dead inside an hour.

305
00:30:49,758 --> 00:30:52,855
Yeah, we all will be, if he don't quit
waiving like that.

306
00:30:56,874 --> 00:30:59,063
Towards you and toward that place.
I'll hold him. Go.

307
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:01,196
Hold him, you go.

308
00:31:02,307 --> 00:31:04,419
Go! Now!

309
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:12,181
- He past out.
- Very good.

310
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,876
I'm gonna take advantage and stitch up,
let me see.

311
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:15,935
Oh god!

312
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,271
Water.

313
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:27,016
Bridger, go tell the others
we'll camp here tonight.

314
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:29,420
- I'm right here.
- Yes, sir.

315
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:32,716
I'll be right here ...

316
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:49,018
Toussaint, he's here.

317
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,869
I thought he wouldn't make it.

318
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:54,753
I'm glad you made it here.

319
00:31:57,242 --> 00:32:00,315
We need horses and rifles.

320
00:32:00,661 --> 00:32:02,818
We bring you many pelts.

321
00:32:03,378 --> 00:32:06,644
No horses...
Just what we agreed.

322
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,252
Take all the pelts you want.

323
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:13,929
We need horses and rifles.

324
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,228
I need a woman with big tits...

325
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,710
Who can cook.

326
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:21,573
We can't give you any horses.

327
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,088
What's he saying?

328
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,368
I don't know, something about horses.

329
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:27,808
Bring us something to drink...
Some whisky.

330
00:32:29,435 --> 00:32:30,877
Tell him to stop asking about the horses.

331
00:32:34,047 --> 00:32:35,837
Always good doing business with you.

332
00:32:36,106 --> 00:32:37,196
Horses.

333
00:32:38,143 --> 00:32:39,033
No horses.

334
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:42,069
All we can trade are guns and ammunition.

335
00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:44,910
Tell him if he asks about horses again,
there is no deal.

336
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:49,282
Where did you get these? The Americans?

337
00:32:50,932 --> 00:32:52,071
They're already branded

338
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:56,011
I'll only be able to get
half price for them.

339
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,743
Get him away from there.

340
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:01,547
I said no horses.

341
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,612
We'll take these three horses.

342
00:33:04,322 --> 00:33:05,665
I'm not going to say it again.

343
00:33:06,204 --> 00:33:07,543
They aren't part of the deal.

344
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,445
Now tell your man to step away.

345
00:33:09,744 --> 00:33:11,453
We had an agreement,
you have to honor it.

346
00:33:12,952 --> 00:33:17,847
<i>In French</i>
You stand there and talk to me about honor?

347
00:33:18,502 --> 00:33:20,217
I told you he speaks French

348
00:33:22,765 --> 00:33:24,331
Those pelts are stolen.

349
00:33:29,198 --> 00:33:32,603
You all have stolen everything from us.

350
00:33:34,895 --> 00:33:36,245
Everything!

351
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,075
The land.

352
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,964
The animals.

353
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:50,385
Two white men snuck into our village,
and took my daughter, Powaqa.

354
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:55,523
We leave you these pelts because honor
demands it.

355
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:58,649
I take your horses to find my daughter.

356
00:33:59,324 --> 00:34:01,713
You are free to try and stop me.

357
00:34:06,531 --> 00:34:09,640
Business is business.

358
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:14,943
Prepare five horses for them.

359
00:34:21,972 --> 00:34:24,126
I want everybody up
at the crack of dawn.

360
00:34:24,207 --> 00:34:25,356
Yes sir. Understood Cap.

361
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,347
Carrying Glass would be hard.

362
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,371
We need to get ahead
as far as possible.

363
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:32,993
We'll divide into two groups.

364
00:34:33,748 --> 00:34:38,542
Fitzgerald, Jones, Fryman. You
take the east side of the river.

365
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,953
Anderson you scout up front.

366
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:45,264
- That claw don't mourn him.
- Everybody else takes turn carrying Glass.

367
00:34:45,454 --> 00:34:46,514
Yes, captain.

368
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,667
They're ain't for me.

369
00:35:32,603 --> 00:35:33,993
Do not let him into the water.

370
00:35:34,103 --> 00:35:35,073
Get up.

371
00:35:36,444 --> 00:35:38,215
- Fuck off.
- That's an order!

372
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:03,939
God dammit, don't let him down!

373
00:36:04,273 --> 00:36:05,777
Don't let him down.

374
00:36:17,811 --> 00:36:18,796
Watch it.

375
00:36:19,723 --> 00:36:21,295
How are we gonna make it up there?

376
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:22,645
Slow down a bit.

377
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,617
It's killing us Captain.

378
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,525
Lift him Bridger.

379
00:36:35,414 --> 00:36:37,097
Keep it steady ...

380
00:36:39,586 --> 00:36:40,501
Everybody.

381
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,337
And here...

382
00:36:43,657 --> 00:36:44,769
I'm gonna go up and pull...

383
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,518
Here...

384
00:36:49,662 --> 00:36:50,779
Hold it.

385
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:57,759
Enough of this shit. We'll never
make it across land this time soon.

386
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,941
He is burning out Captain.

387
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:04,365
Captain you ain't doing us, nor him...

388
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:07,805
...no favors while in we
going on suffering like this.

389
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,922
Captain!

390
00:37:09,336 --> 00:37:13,513
Captain, it's all the same up here.
We have to go back.

391
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:15,570
Find another way.

392
00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:20,688
Hold on.

393
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,144
Glass...
Hugh...

394
00:37:26,637 --> 00:37:28,652
...I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

395
00:37:29,342 --> 00:37:31,990
Plant that rag over
his eyes Mr. Bridger.

396
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:33,622
- What?
- Sir, I can't.

397
00:37:33,646 --> 00:37:35,116
Plant that rag over his eyes.

398
00:37:35,151 --> 00:37:36,586
- What, wait.
- Sorry Hugh.

399
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:40,171
- Wait. Sir, I can't do that.
- How do we get back without him?

400
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,025
- He's the only one who knows the way.
- He can't go any further.

401
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,342
Wave that rag over his eyes.
- Wait.

402
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:44,315
Sir, I can't.

403
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:45,379
Wait, you can't ...

404
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:49,114
Put a rag over his eyes.

405
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:51,386
Lay it over his eyes.

406
00:37:52,325 --> 00:37:53,366
Step back.

407
00:37:56,819 --> 00:37:58,561
Stop, Mr. Henry ...

408
00:37:59,138 --> 00:38:00,440
Henry, please.

409
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,889
Captain, captain ...

410
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,070
Hey, Hawk!

411
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:05,463
Calm down kid.

412
00:38:05,856 --> 00:38:06,876
Calm down.

413
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,552
Henry, please ...

414
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:16,945
There's a $70 bonus in the
Rocky Mountains fur company ...

415
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:18,516
...for two men, who stays ...

416
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:20,395
back with Glass, to see this through.

417
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,954
- I'll stay.
- Me too.

418
00:38:22,187 --> 00:38:23,257
Money or not, I'll stay.

419
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:26,176
I need a third.

420
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,754
Sorry Captain, I have family ...

421
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:30,996
I am not crazy.

422
00:38:32,006 --> 00:38:35,262
Captain, three men can't
hold off a party of Ree.

423
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:36,560
Much less boys.

424
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:40,323
Besides, $70 ain't going
by nobody lose their ears.

425
00:38:40,347 --> 00:38:41,449
100 then.

426
00:38:42,262 --> 00:38:44,264
This man is the only
reason we're still alive.

427
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:49,090
Oh captain, we were 45 men when we started,
now we're 10, almost 9.

428
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:51,305
- He's my father,
you can have my share.

429
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,426
- Mine too.

430
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,714
- Have our share also.

431
00:38:58,542 --> 00:38:59,633
Alright.

432
00:39:00,394 --> 00:39:03,485
Alright, if Mr. Bridger feels the same way,
then I'll lead behind of them.

433
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:04,573
- You?
- Yeah.

434
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:07,196
You already lost my share of the pelts...

435
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,928
So I don't got much choice but to try
to make it up some other means.

436
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:13,874
Besides, sticking around for another
day or two don't make no difference.

437
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,697
$300, is to get to go home with something.

438
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:18,660
Glass is to be cared for until...

439
00:39:18,684 --> 00:39:19,610
Understood?

440
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:21,599
Yeah.
You have my word, understand.

441
00:39:24,547 --> 00:39:27,193
You boys get him down of this slope
there somewhere safe before the dark.

442
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:28,607
You heard the boys.

443
00:39:28,642 --> 00:39:29,986
- Fitzgerald.
- Captain.

444
00:39:31,857 --> 00:39:34,152
Glass is to be cared for
as long as necessary.

445
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:37,607
And a proper burial when it's time.
He's earned it.

446
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:40,309
Understand.

447
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:58,950
Can you hear the wind, father?

448
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:07,282
Remember what mother
used to say about wind?

449
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:15,793
The wind cannot defeat a
tree with strong roots.

450
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,685
You are still breathing...

451
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:29,129
I miss her so much.

452
00:40:49,837 --> 00:40:51,920
I will be right here...

453
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,233
I'm right here.

454
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:05,511
As long as you can still
grab a breath, you fight.

455
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:09,918
You breathe.
Keep breathing.

456
00:41:09,942 --> 00:41:13,759
When there is a storm...

457
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:21,960
And you stand in front of a tree...

458
00:41:26,238 --> 00:41:33,289
If you look at its branches,
you swear it will fall.

459
00:41:43,423 --> 00:41:51,360
But if you watch the trunk,
you will see its stability.

460
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:36,186
$300 goes along way
toward retiring...

461
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:39,633
Way down to Texas, buy me
a decent piece of land...

462
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,354
...and start pissing in the wind.

463
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:45,042
Getting the hell out of
this godforsaken places.

464
00:42:49,882 --> 00:42:51,200
- Did Ree done that to you?

465
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:54,401
- I was just asking.

466
00:42:55,746 --> 00:42:57,021
They done it.

467
00:42:58,133 --> 00:43:00,375
They took their sweet town with it too.

468
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:02,909
At the start I didn't feel nothing,

469
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,650
I just heard the sound of...

470
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:07,253
...knife scraping against
my skull, you know ...

471
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:11,738
They were all laughin' and whoopin'
and hollerin' what not...

472
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:14,082
Then the blood came ...

473
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,040
The cold started streaming down
my face and my eyes ...

474
00:43:19,051 --> 00:43:20,369
The breathing it in...

475
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:22,290
...choking on it.

476
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:25,764
That's when I felt it.

477
00:43:26,795 --> 00:43:28,107
I felt all of it.

478
00:43:29,513 --> 00:43:31,434
They got my head turned inside out.

479
00:43:32,955 --> 00:43:33,641
Jesus.

480
00:43:34,058 --> 00:43:36,050
Yeah, them Indians down Texas way...

481
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:38,553
...they may rob you, ain't
gonna take your topknot.

482
00:43:40,649 --> 00:43:41,858
When was it?

483
00:43:45,297 --> 00:43:48,890
God damn, will you just, would
you quit that noise now, will ya?

484
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:51,226
Or just... Leave it.

485
00:44:17,235 --> 00:44:19,604
I'm following further back
from heading against the boys

486
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:21,550
on account of tending to you.

487
00:44:25,794 --> 00:44:28,911
We got to get up that damn mountain
but the wind keeps chasing us down.

488
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:33,535
If you're ready ...

489
00:44:33,793 --> 00:44:35,337
...take the sacrament.

490
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:38,047
I can do that for you.

491
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:45,582
What you holding to Glass?

492
00:44:49,543 --> 00:44:50,655
You know?

493
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,859
Would be better...

494
00:44:53,226 --> 00:44:56,106
...if you would've take that
last breath of yours now.

495
00:44:56,687 --> 00:44:57,869
For all of us.

496
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,541
You hung tough.

497
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:04,050
That's something.

498
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,931
I'm begging you glass.

499
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:09,469
Them Ree, they are so close now
i can smell them ...

500
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:11,645
...and I know you can smell them to,
when you got to think.

501
00:45:11,695 --> 00:45:13,092
You gotta think of your boy.

502
00:45:13,584 --> 00:45:15,846
Alright?
Cause you're gonna kill him.

503
00:45:15,923 --> 00:45:17,534
You'll kill all of us.

504
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:26,764
I can muzzle you if you like.

505
00:45:27,437 --> 00:45:29,744
Take away the suffering,
really quick and easy ...

506
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,845
...no one has to know
that you give up. I do that.

507
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:35,269
All you gotta to do is blink ...

508
00:45:35,293 --> 00:45:36,552
...if you want me to do that.

509
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:44,931
Save your boy and blink.

510
00:45:55,123 --> 00:45:56,892
You just have to blink.

511
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:03,362
Yeah.

512
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:04,452
Oh yes!

513
00:46:05,378 --> 00:46:08,276
You best hope that the good Lord
get his ass here quick, huh.

514
00:46:12,789 --> 00:46:14,900
Maybe he'll forgive your sins, you know
maybe he won't ...

515
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:17,091
You just sudden commend it
to the Lord.

516
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:22,391
Through Jesus Christ, the lord
of all reality and mercy ...

517
00:46:26,872 --> 00:46:29,095
Get away.
Get away.

518
00:46:29,677 --> 00:46:32,651
You ok?
Jim. Jim ... help.

519
00:46:44,244 --> 00:46:46,915
- Help.
- Calm down. Alright, you don't understand.

520
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,835
Don't shout, you'll get
us all fuckin' killed.

521
00:46:50,847 --> 00:46:51,703
Keep away.

522
00:46:51,832 --> 00:46:54,535
I'll tell Jim and the captain what
you did and they'll hang you.

523
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:57,012
- You have to understand this ...
- They'll hang you ...

524
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,527
Jim help.
Jim get over here.

525
00:46:59,868 --> 00:47:01,606
Keep quiet!

526
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:17,266
Shit.

527
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:19,826
Got one beaver half.

528
00:48:22,241 --> 00:48:23,562
His breathing changed?

529
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:26,810
I ain't noticed.

530
00:48:28,797 --> 00:48:30,193
Damn, he's cold as ice.

531
00:48:32,281 --> 00:48:35,130
Here Mr. Glass ... this will help ...

532
00:48:35,933 --> 00:48:37,154
It will keep you warm.

533
00:48:38,094 --> 00:48:39,056
It's alright.

534
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:42,109
Where is Hawk?

535
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,203
He ain't with you?

536
00:48:47,053 --> 00:48:48,492
- No.
- No?

537
00:48:54,378 --> 00:48:55,762
I understand Mr. Glass.

538
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,397
Alright.

539
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,642
I think I'm gonna get a fire going.

540
00:48:59,844 --> 00:49:01,787
Yeah, sounds like a good idea.

541
00:49:08,768 --> 00:49:09,668
Hawk!

542
00:49:10,276 --> 00:49:13,193
You killed my son.

543
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:14,210
Hawk!

544
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:40,301
Ree, there's about 20
of them down by the creek.

545
00:49:41,038 --> 00:49:42,285
They're headed this way.

546
00:49:42,676 --> 00:49:44,387
Now grab your shit and let's go.

547
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:48,580
Shit. Wait.
What do we do?

548
00:49:48,994 --> 00:49:50,421
- Run right now.

549
00:49:50,806 --> 00:49:53,494
- What about Hawk?
- He ain't our problem no more.

550
00:49:54,446 --> 00:49:55,635
We can't just leave him here.

551
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,739
- Well, he's got it to be
scalped, if he ain't?

552
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,749
If that Ree can find us, can't he?

553
00:49:59,784 --> 00:50:01,469
- Wait. What about Glass?

554
00:50:01,676 --> 00:50:04,170
He ain't our problem no more,
he is like us, he's on his own.

555
00:50:04,765 --> 00:50:07,192
No, no, we made a promise to Captain.

556
00:50:07,285 --> 00:50:08,797
I'll give him a proper burial
when the time is needed.

557
00:50:08,865 --> 00:50:10,141
Well he needs that rifle.

558
00:50:10,665 --> 00:50:13,064
He can't do nothing with it if
you tarred it to his hands.

559
00:50:13,088 --> 00:50:14,859
Now come on get your shit. Let's go.

560
00:50:14,986 --> 00:50:16,251
No, no, we can't do this.

561
00:50:16,895 --> 00:50:19,806
- We got no fucking choice.
- No, no, we can't. Look at him.

562
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:24,502
- Alright, shitting brain ...
- What you doin'?

563
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,112
Can you take him?
Let's go.

564
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:28,524
No, no wait...

565
00:50:30,683 --> 00:50:32,247
Easy, slowly Fitz ...

566
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,271
Easy with him.

567
00:50:34,373 --> 00:50:37,129
- I can't ... Damn.
- Just get this shit.

568
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:38,998
Get this shit.

569
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:40,326
- Wait, hold ...

570
00:50:40,361 --> 00:50:41,353
- Hold on!

571
00:50:45,645 --> 00:50:46,524
Shut up.

572
00:50:47,228 --> 00:50:48,385
- Hold on.

573
00:50:51,567 --> 00:50:52,527
- Fitz...

574
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,680
- What are you doing?
- What it looks like I'm doing?

575
00:50:55,474 --> 00:50:56,616
A proper burial.

576
00:50:56,706 --> 00:50:57,633
Like he wanted.

577
00:50:57,986 --> 00:51:00,337
- No, not like this.
- Why not?

578
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:04,390
- He is alive Fitz.
He's alive.

579
00:51:06,656 --> 00:51:07,786
So shoot him.

580
00:51:20,831 --> 00:51:22,742
I have to go, I have to...

581
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:26,028
I'm sorry.

582
00:51:27,303 --> 00:51:28,558
I'm sorry.

583
00:51:43,354 --> 00:51:45,434
Captain, this way ...

584
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:48,684
There's a path down here.

585
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:50,815
There's no way through down here.

586
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,322
There ain't shit down there,
we go climb over.

587
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:57,117
- Cross can go to hell.

588
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:01,082
- What does the map say?
- Keep climbing.

589
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:02,602
We climb Captain.

590
00:52:02,942 --> 00:52:04,473
We keep climbing.

591
00:52:04,718 --> 00:52:06,225
Until we reach our gate.

592
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:11,646
Climb.

593
00:52:13,606 --> 00:52:14,869
- You got away from Murph?
- Yeah.

594
00:52:15,281 --> 00:52:16,522
- You wait for it.

595
00:52:17,919 --> 00:52:18,766
- Captain.

596
00:52:22,078 --> 00:52:25,200
- Sir. Murphy says there's
a way down there.

597
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:27,352
- Who we following?

598
00:52:27,448 --> 00:52:28,858
- You follow who you want.

599
00:52:28,893 --> 00:52:30,059
- I'm going up.

600
00:52:31,724 --> 00:52:35,222
We all need to be going up.
Blair, come here!

601
00:55:57,613 --> 00:56:01,674
I'm not leaving you, son.

602
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,830
I'm right here.

603
00:57:11,647 --> 00:57:12,968
Fire's done.

604
00:57:14,629 --> 00:57:16,136
I can't still feel my feet ...

605
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,476
Besides, didn't we put enough distance
between us and them Ree anyhow?

606
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,309
Well...

607
00:57:22,492 --> 00:57:24,667
...a dozen Ree could still made
twice the good time as we can.

608
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,234
- 20.
- What?

609
00:57:28,655 --> 00:57:30,564
I thought you said that
you saw 20 Ree before.

610
00:57:30,596 --> 00:57:32,166
Yeah, what you talking about?

611
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,787
You woke me up?

612
00:57:38,696 --> 00:57:40,631
You said you saw 20 Ree
down by the creek.

613
00:57:41,077 --> 00:57:44,013
Well yeah, 20 or dozen,
it don't matter ...

614
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:45,505
...i wasn't gonna exactly
hang around the creek

615
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,116
...counting fuckin' feathers,
now would I?

616
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,770
Matter a fact.

617
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:56,178
What was you doing down
by the creek all by yourself?

618
00:57:57,473 --> 00:57:59,239
I thought I already brought
up plenty of water.

619
00:58:01,366 --> 00:58:02,357
Hey!

620
00:58:03,843 --> 00:58:05,673
Answer me Fitzgerald,
I asked you a question.

621
00:58:07,492 --> 00:58:10,137
Don't go questioning me now on the
account of fact that we all feel...

622
00:58:10,149 --> 00:58:11,401
...guilty about leaving this Glass behind.
- Answer me, or...

623
00:58:11,407 --> 00:58:12,704
...I'm gonna blow your damn head off.

624
00:58:12,895 --> 00:58:14,540
You got a short memory boy.

625
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,958
Your ass is still be floatin'
around Missouri right now...

626
00:58:17,982 --> 00:58:19,116
...if it wasn't for me.

627
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,948
Now wanna ask questions ...

628
00:58:23,648 --> 00:58:25,420
...what you want ask if
you won't know asking.

629
00:58:27,677 --> 00:58:30,457
You want to know why you left
Mr. Glass back there for dead, hah?

630
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:32,246
Maybe...

631
00:58:32,507 --> 00:58:34,899
...while you left your little boy friend
wandering around, you don't

632
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:37,354
know if he's still alive yet.
That what you want to know?

633
00:58:37,696 --> 00:58:39,836
I'll tell you lies 'cause
you ain't a man yet.

634
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:42,498
Alright? Because you
were scared shitless...

635
00:58:42,522 --> 00:58:43,915
...and you're scared now.
Now put your rifle down.

636
00:58:44,225 --> 00:58:46,071
- The Ree.
- What off it?

637
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,746
Tell me right now and be honest.
Did you see 'em?

638
00:58:49,761 --> 00:58:51,257
- Put your rifle down.
- Did you see the Ree?

639
00:58:53,908 --> 00:58:55,063
No.

640
00:58:56,415 --> 00:58:57,815
Not a single one.

641
00:59:00,755 --> 00:59:02,189
- You fucking lie to me?

642
00:59:02,711 --> 00:59:03,958
- You lie to me!

643
00:59:08,113 --> 00:59:10,314
I had to scare samo sense into you boy.

644
00:59:11,084 --> 00:59:13,404
Now Glass was dead, Hawk
we don't know about ...

645
00:59:13,484 --> 00:59:15,723
There is no point either of us
dying here, do you understand?

646
00:59:16,561 --> 00:59:18,741
The way I see it, I saved
your life twice now son.

647
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:20,313
I ought to be God to you ...

648
00:59:21,689 --> 00:59:24,654
And God giveth, God taketh away.

649
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:29,828
Shit.

650
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:33,367
Fuck.

651
00:59:34,959 --> 00:59:36,728
Next time, if you want
to shoot somebody ...

652
00:59:36,752 --> 00:59:39,780
...you might wanna use, you
might wanna use powder.

653
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:41,527
...prime your rifle.

654
00:59:44,738 --> 00:59:45,591
Come on...

655
00:59:46,231 --> 00:59:48,492
...let's get up. Grab your shit.

656
01:03:49,538 --> 01:03:52,592
Fresh blood.
This could be Powaqa.

657
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:06,443
A dead guy.

658
01:04:15,441 --> 01:04:16,839
A Pawnee boy.

659
01:04:17,837 --> 01:04:18,909
Let's go.

660
01:07:32,321 --> 01:07:34,515
Captain wait...

661
01:14:28,091 --> 01:14:30,546
- Who did this?
- I don't know.

662
01:14:38,783 --> 01:14:41,146
Could be captain Leavenworth boys.

663
01:14:43,746 --> 01:14:44,703
Hm, yeah.

664
01:14:45,808 --> 01:14:47,757
You put some eyes on the back of your head.

665
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:54,143
These Indians ain't never as dead
as you'll think they are.

666
01:14:55,395 --> 01:14:58,608
Look at them, they're
always stealing our shit.

667
01:15:35,682 --> 01:15:37,084
We got horses over here.

668
01:15:41,843 --> 01:15:42,954
Alright, Bridger.

669
01:15:48,726 --> 01:15:49,818
We got horses.

670
01:15:56,015 --> 01:15:57,753
What you wanna do about this pigs?

671
01:16:05,221 --> 01:16:06,878
Lord is on our side kid.

672
01:16:15,874 --> 01:16:16,914
You alright there kid?

673
01:16:17,758 --> 01:16:18,957
You're head in the right place?

674
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,139
I guess.

675
01:16:26,754 --> 01:16:28,437
Can't help thinking about
whether we did the right...

676
01:16:28,449 --> 01:16:29,014
No.

677
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:31,182
Ain't our place to wonder.

678
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:34,450
Good Lord's got us on the road,
whether we chose or not.

679
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:41,420
My pa being one ... he wasn't a
religious man you, you know?

680
01:16:41,935 --> 01:16:44,033
If you couldn't grow it,
or kill it or eat it ...

681
01:16:44,275 --> 01:16:46,537
...then he just plain all didn't
believe in it and that was it.

682
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:50,855
And this one time he hit
on up the old Saber Hills.

683
01:16:51,114 --> 01:16:52,402
San Saber Hills ...

684
01:16:53,751 --> 01:16:56,848
Joined up with a couple of Texas range
buddies of his to hunt, you know.

685
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:00,572
Pretty routine, you know, they
done it like hundred times before.

686
01:17:00,663 --> 01:17:05,603
Should have been three days of kill,
but on Saturday, well it all went fucked.

687
01:17:06,215 --> 01:17:08,548
Somehow that night he
has to lose buddies ...

688
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:09,890
...and on top of it all ...

689
01:17:10,548 --> 01:17:13,327
...the Comanches they went
and took the horses, so ...

690
01:17:13,704 --> 01:17:15,111
...he was starving,

691
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,405
...he was delirious...

692
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,611
...and crawles up into this mud ...

693
01:17:20,244 --> 01:17:23,158
...like the group of trees out there
in the middle of nowhere ...

694
01:17:23,252 --> 01:17:25,771
...just sticking up in
this ocean of scrub ...

695
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,568
...and he found religion.

696
01:17:28,924 --> 01:17:30,218
At that moment...

697
01:17:30,242 --> 01:17:31,336
...he told me...

698
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:33,206
...he found God.

699
01:17:40,612 --> 01:17:42,100
It turns out ...

700
01:17:42,393 --> 01:17:43,561
...the God ...

701
01:17:45,037 --> 01:17:46,298
...He is a squirrel.

702
01:17:47,617 --> 01:17:49,797
Yeah. Then go meet him one...

703
01:17:52,853 --> 01:17:55,111
I found God, he used to say.

704
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:58,759
Who has sitting and basking ...

705
01:17:58,954 --> 01:18:01,129
...in glory in subliminal mercy ...

706
01:18:02,953 --> 01:18:05,088
I shot knee that son of a bitch ...

707
01:18:19,148 --> 01:18:21,128
Yeah, you might wanna
close your eyes kid.

708
01:27:06,312 --> 01:27:08,918
I'm injured.

709
01:27:10,023 --> 01:27:11,095
What happened to you?

710
01:27:14,012 --> 01:27:17,430
A bear.

711
01:27:19,431 --> 01:27:20,704
A grizzly.

712
01:27:39,314 --> 01:27:42,752
My men ... left me for dead.

713
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:46,107
Killed my son.

714
01:27:49,712 --> 01:27:53,000
I lost my family too.

715
01:27:55,244 --> 01:27:57,312
Sioux killed my people.

716
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:07,203
I'm going south to find more Pawnee.

717
01:28:09,067 --> 01:28:10,770
My heart bleeds ...

718
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:16,945
But revenge is in the creator's hands.

719
01:28:25,765 --> 01:28:26,957
You will ride with me ...

720
01:29:35,062 --> 01:29:36,478
Your body is rotten.

721
01:29:37,881 --> 01:29:39,184
Need to heal.

722
01:29:44,914 --> 01:29:45,998
You could die.

723
01:30:01,052 --> 01:30:02,141
Yeah!

724
01:30:02,227 --> 01:30:03,913
There she is.

725
01:30:05,653 --> 01:30:06,847
We did it.

726
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:10,342
You ought to be proud of yourself boy.

727
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:12,361
Yeah.

728
01:30:12,666 --> 01:30:15,735
Well we followed orders ...
we just kept the funeral apart.

729
01:30:16,472 --> 01:30:19,581
Don't go down there starting going
no kind no conscience, alright?

730
01:30:20,056 --> 01:30:23,039
Cause sure is neither come will have
us both swinging from couple grants.

731
01:30:24,131 --> 01:30:26,050
Now, we did what we had to do.

732
01:30:54,692 --> 01:30:57,406
We had the extra day, so we
managed to dig a little deeper ...

733
01:30:57,430 --> 01:30:59,712
...leave some rocks on top, so that
the scavengers couldn't get out to him...

734
01:30:59,782 --> 01:31:01,559
...we was done right and all.

735
01:31:02,646 --> 01:31:04,102
He was buried right.

736
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:07,288
- Sir ...
- The truth is that, ah ...

737
01:31:08,773 --> 01:31:11,597
When Hawk disappeared, I was
worried about the savages.

738
01:31:12,027 --> 01:31:16,484
I was ready to get ...
...moving on out you know, but...

739
01:31:17,227 --> 01:31:19,570
Bridger here, he argued to stay.

740
01:31:20,567 --> 01:31:22,242
He argued to stay so that ...

741
01:31:22,551 --> 01:31:25,252
...he could at least build
the cross, or something ...

742
01:31:25,991 --> 01:31:29,011
...to put on top of Glass's grave,
and that's what he did, that's...

743
01:31:29,948 --> 01:31:30,626
That's what we did.

744
01:31:30,638 --> 01:31:32,348
Glad to hear you pulled
your weight Mr. Bridger.

745
01:31:32,383 --> 01:31:33,356
I know you would.

746
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:35,299
Yeah, well, more than
he pulled his weight Captain is...

747
01:31:35,311 --> 01:31:37,376
...this man here,
he was my partner.

748
01:31:40,395 --> 01:31:41,480
Alright.

749
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,524
Am I to assume that there was agreed
arrangement did not changed?

750
01:31:47,632 --> 01:31:49,772
Fortunately for me it did not, no.

751
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:13,338
Thank you.

752
01:32:14,301 --> 01:32:16,241
For your courage, honor ...

753
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:18,031
- ...and service.
- Yeah.

754
01:32:19,188 --> 01:32:22,671
Deal or no deal Mr. Bridger, you
deserve something for what you did.

755
01:32:23,512 --> 01:32:24,368
Thank you.

756
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:38,749
Kid's been beating himself up of
the bag hole trip.

757
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:46,425
We all saw the shape Glass was in,
it was no more to be done, right?

758
01:32:47,548 --> 01:32:48,474
Yeah.

759
01:32:50,172 --> 01:32:51,617
We all saw it.

760
01:36:18,168 --> 01:36:22,040
When there is a storm ...

761
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:30,121
And you stand in front of a tree ...

762
01:36:31,589 --> 01:36:37,554
If you look at its branches,
you swear it will fall ...

763
01:36:43,499 --> 01:36:52,383
But if you watch the trunk,
you will see its stability.

764
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:12,270
WE ARE ALL SAVAGES

765
01:42:13,072 --> 01:42:15,431
There are traces of a camp ...

766
01:42:16,289 --> 01:42:18,346
There are traces of a camp ...

767
01:42:20,297 --> 01:42:21,163
Where?

768
01:42:21,387 --> 01:42:23,819
Entering the moon forest.

769
01:42:24,857 --> 01:42:29,236
Maybe two days ago.
They are moving east.

770
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:31,741
Tell the others.

771
01:42:32,344 --> 01:42:35,533
Let's move quicky,
Powaqa could be with them!

772
01:42:56,675 --> 01:42:58,188
Bring me the girl ...

773
01:42:59,435 --> 01:43:01,752
Those five horses
weren't for free.

774
01:44:26,033 --> 01:44:27,408
Don't make a sound.

775
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:32,962
Be quiet.

776
01:44:43,177 --> 01:44:49,448
I will get a horse.

777
01:44:50,037 --> 01:44:53,969
I'll cut off your balls.

778
01:45:08,789 --> 01:45:11,084
Where is Toussaint?

779
01:45:14,513 --> 01:45:15,953
Come here...

780
01:46:07,729 --> 01:46:09,764
- May I join you?
- Yes.

781
01:46:09,799 --> 01:46:11,013
- Yeah?
- Yes.

782
01:46:12,017 --> 01:46:15,195
Damn I was wondering when we might
be getting paid for that haul?

783
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:19,752
Cause them, them pelts we collect,
they are still out there ...

784
01:46:20,029 --> 01:46:22,290
...they ought to covered
full of dirt and some snow,

785
01:46:22,302 --> 01:46:24,175
but they are there, and
that ain't my fault.

786
01:46:25,021 --> 01:46:27,780
I'm waiting for captain Leavenworth
to arrive with his army ...

787
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:29,481
And then we'll have enough men...

788
01:46:29,545 --> 01:46:31,674
...to get back out there
and shoot some civilization ...

789
01:46:31,702 --> 01:46:35,322
...into those fucking Arikara,
get back our pelts.

790
01:46:35,412 --> 01:46:37,124
Alright, alright.

791
01:46:38,101 --> 01:46:39,843
And now when is that supposed to happen?

792
01:46:40,666 --> 01:46:41,818
I don't know but...

793
01:46:42,251 --> 01:46:43,938
...until then nobody gets paid.

794
01:46:46,679 --> 01:46:48,377
Listen here, alright?

795
01:46:49,265 --> 01:46:52,523
I was hired to trap them...
I wasn't hired to guard them.

796
01:46:53,227 --> 01:46:58,106
The way I see it ... you got a safe.

797
01:46:58,266 --> 01:47:00,809
- Probably full of money.
- You signed a contract.

798
01:47:01,454 --> 01:47:04,069
To protect your boss and
your boss's property.

799
01:47:05,454 --> 01:47:08,404
And that safe isn't full anymore,
it's short about $300.

800
01:47:08,439 --> 01:47:11,781
Short? Short? What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

801
01:47:12,483 --> 01:47:14,483
It means according to my cash records...

802
01:47:14,507 --> 01:47:18,020
You purchased more goods on the expedition
than what you are owed by the company.

803
01:47:23,629 --> 01:47:25,294
Happy new year, Fitzgerald.

804
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:20,384
FITZGERALD
KILLED MY SON

805
01:56:33,534 --> 01:56:34,739
White man at the gate.

806
01:56:42,169 --> 01:56:45,710
What's up? Who you are?

807
01:56:49,103 --> 01:56:51,488
I have no weapon, I have no weapons.

808
01:56:53,023 --> 01:56:55,303
- Dobb, get the Captain.
- I have no weapon.

809
01:56:55,363 --> 01:56:56,580
Where are your men?

810
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:58,863
- Dead, all dead.
- Who was he?

811
01:57:00,144 --> 01:57:02,749
I don't know, something to eat please.

812
01:57:02,828 --> 01:57:04,069
Food comes at price.

813
01:57:05,504 --> 01:57:06,248
I have no money.

814
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:08,277
Then you don't eat this,
see how that works.

815
01:57:08,301 --> 01:57:11,248
Maybe you can give back some of them
stolen pelts you buy from the Indians.

816
01:57:11,372 --> 01:57:13,274
- Not now Jones.
- Silver.

817
01:57:13,309 --> 01:57:14,445
This is silver.

818
01:57:15,781 --> 01:57:17,069
Oh yeah?

819
01:57:18,077 --> 01:57:19,133
This all you got?

820
01:57:21,662 --> 01:57:26,337
We was 9 ... but my friend
he died in the snow...

821
01:57:26,701 --> 01:57:27,950
...and the others were ...

822
01:57:28,998 --> 01:57:32,032
...by wolves ... by wolves ...

823
01:57:33,409 --> 01:57:34,945
- Wait, where did you get this?

824
01:57:35,863 --> 01:57:37,191
The canteen.

825
01:57:37,737 --> 01:57:39,707
He ... he drop it in the snow.

826
01:57:40,232 --> 01:57:43,834
- Who, who?
- I do not know, I don't see. I don't see.

827
01:57:46,042 --> 01:57:47,119
It could be Hawk.

828
01:57:49,903 --> 01:57:53,099
- Yeah, it could be.

829
01:57:53,223 --> 01:57:54,843
- Maybe it was the Weston.
- How far from here?

830
01:57:55,090 --> 01:57:57,401
- How far from here?
- 13 miles ...

831
01:57:57,542 --> 01:58:01,076
Northwest ... near the yellowstone.

832
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:02,443
- Get the horses saddled.

833
01:58:03,064 --> 01:58:04,980
- Torches and supplies, $10 a men.

834
01:58:05,798 --> 01:58:08,337
- Anderson, you stay here.
- Yes sir.

835
01:58:08,489 --> 01:58:10,061
- Feed him and watch him ...

836
01:58:11,751 --> 01:58:13,024
- I'll get you a drink.

837
01:58:25,614 --> 01:58:26,773
Open the gate.

838
01:59:04,572 --> 01:59:05,719
- Keep your guard up.

839
01:59:08,037 --> 01:59:09,133
- Eyes in front.

840
01:59:11,150 --> 01:59:12,233
Nice and easy.

841
01:59:14,916 --> 01:59:16,356
Slow.

842
01:59:21,092 --> 01:59:22,221
Who you are?

843
01:59:22,752 --> 01:59:24,737
Beckett?
Is that you?

844
01:59:24,738 --> 01:59:25,843
Weston?

845
01:59:36,324 --> 01:59:37,203
Glass.

846
01:59:38,141 --> 01:59:39,272
- That's glass...
- Glass...

847
01:59:39,307 --> 01:59:40,220
It's okay.

848
01:59:40,532 --> 01:59:41,775
Jesus Christ.

849
01:59:42,260 --> 01:59:43,583
Jesus Christ, what happened?

850
01:59:44,875 --> 01:59:46,096
Where is he?

851
01:59:49,363 --> 01:59:50,932
Jones take him, go.

852
01:59:51,488 --> 01:59:52,880
Go, I'm riding ahead.

853
01:59:52,974 --> 01:59:54,485
- Phil.
- Take Bridger.

854
01:59:55,732 --> 01:59:56,875
Take Bridger.

855
01:59:57,168 --> 01:59:58,683
- You got it Glass.
- Go.

856
02:00:05,330 --> 02:00:06,450
Open the gate.

857
02:00:11,644 --> 02:00:13,507
- Have you seen Fitzgerald?
- No sir.

858
02:00:19,797 --> 02:00:20,682
Get up.

859
02:00:21,364 --> 02:00:22,211
Get up.

860
02:00:22,251 --> 02:00:23,824
- Have you seen Fitzgerald?
- No sir.

861
02:00:23,859 --> 02:00:24,742
Fitzgerald.

862
02:00:36,002 --> 02:00:37,264
- Oh easy.
- Where did he go?

863
02:00:38,846 --> 02:00:40,046
- Who?
- Fitzgerald.

864
02:00:40,299 --> 02:00:41,260
Where did he go?

865
02:00:42,111 --> 02:00:44,554
- I have no idea.
- Tell me or I'll take your head off.

866
02:00:44,558 --> 02:00:47,370
- Captain, I swear to god.
- Tell me!

867
02:00:47,813 --> 02:00:49,303
- Tell me!
- Texas.

868
02:00:49,338 --> 02:00:51,675
- Texas?
- He said he was going to Texas.

869
02:00:52,331 --> 02:00:54,152
I swear to god, he said
he was going to re-enlist.

870
02:00:54,283 --> 02:00:57,341
And he start talking of a property,
a decent piece of land ...

871
02:00:57,884 --> 02:01:00,267
...he's heading to Texas.
I swear to god.

872
02:01:00,287 --> 02:01:01,357
Stay here.

873
02:01:04,580 --> 02:01:05,830
Fitzgerald.

874
02:01:07,511 --> 02:01:09,061
Fitzgerald.

875
02:01:37,944 --> 02:01:39,008
God dammit.

876
02:01:42,288 --> 02:01:43,471
God dammit.

877
02:01:48,133 --> 02:01:49,352
Open the gate.

878
02:01:49,837 --> 02:01:50,992
Open her up.

879
02:01:53,573 --> 02:01:54,881
Search Captain.

880
02:02:01,082 --> 02:02:03,392
Get him to the doctor, now.

881
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:06,298
You said he was dead.

882
02:02:07,258 --> 02:02:09,688
- You said he was dead.
- I thought he was dead, I swear.

883
02:02:12,028 --> 02:02:13,632
- You're a liar.
- He lied to me.

884
02:02:13,653 --> 02:02:16,956
Liar, you left.
You left him out there.

885
02:02:17,089 --> 02:02:19,439
- I thought he was ...
- Say the Lord's prayer.

886
02:02:19,477 --> 02:02:22,032
- What?
- Say the Lord's prayer.

887
02:02:23,324 --> 02:02:24,840
Our Father...

888
02:02:24,948 --> 02:02:27,940
...who art in heaven ...
...I can't ...

889
02:02:28,041 --> 02:02:28,772
Shut up.

890
02:02:28,894 --> 02:02:32,300
Shut up! From here on you are
a prisoner charged with treason.

891
02:02:33,016 --> 02:02:35,678
Take him to the cage.
Take him to the cage!

892
02:02:35,705 --> 02:02:37,196
You handle or I'll shoot him!

893
02:02:38,252 --> 02:02:39,819
I thought he was gonna die.

894
02:02:40,710 --> 02:02:42,951
- Get up.
- Doc.

895
02:02:44,342 --> 02:02:45,938
I could help, please.

896
02:02:46,952 --> 02:02:49,387
- Please Captain ...
- God!

897
02:02:50,592 --> 02:02:51,904
Alright. Come on.

898
02:03:00,744 --> 02:03:02,221
1, 2, 3.

899
02:03:02,256 --> 02:03:03,900
Slide, slide. Slide.

900
02:03:23,092 --> 02:03:25,389
- How is he?
- He'll be fine, but there is swelling ...

901
02:03:25,660 --> 02:03:26,569
...needs to rest.

902
02:03:27,101 --> 02:03:28,418
I'll be back to check up on him.

903
02:03:38,315 --> 02:03:40,154
He ran off, didn't he?

904
02:03:49,037 --> 02:03:51,142
Bridger is telling the truth ...

905
02:03:53,438 --> 02:03:57,159
- How is that?
- Fitzgerald lied to him...

906
02:03:57,343 --> 02:03:59,004
...he was just following orders.

907
02:04:01,172 --> 02:04:04,646
He wasn't there when Fitzgerald
stabbed my boy to death.

908
02:04:08,839 --> 02:04:13,775
Is that what happened?
He killed Hawk?

909
02:04:18,496 --> 02:04:19,870
I need a horse and a gun.

910
02:04:19,905 --> 02:04:21,980
- No, you need to rest
and something to eat.

911
02:04:22,379 --> 02:04:24,296
- I'm going after him.
- No.

912
02:04:25,858 --> 02:04:27,462
You'll never find
him without me.

913
02:04:27,474 --> 02:04:30,752
If we wait till morning he'll have
a days head start and he get away.

914
02:04:30,915 --> 02:04:32,312
No he won't.

915
02:04:33,682 --> 02:04:35,077
He's afraid.

916
02:04:36,690 --> 02:04:38,936
He knows how far I came for him.

917
02:04:40,374 --> 02:04:44,721
Same as that elk, when they get afraid
they run deep in to the woods ...

918
02:04:45,807 --> 02:04:47,558
I got him trapped, he just...

919
02:04:48,323 --> 02:04:51,481
He doesn't know it yet.
- How can you be so sure?

920
02:04:52,863 --> 02:04:54,993
Cause he got everything to lose.

921
02:04:57,375 --> 02:05:00,088
All I had was that boy ...

922
02:05:01,216 --> 02:05:02,943
...and he took him from me.

923
02:05:07,006 --> 02:05:08,872
I can't let you go back out there.

924
02:05:09,403 --> 02:05:12,573
- Not again.
- No.

925
02:05:14,321 --> 02:05:16,476
I ain't afraid to die anymore.

926
02:05:18,803 --> 02:05:20,342
I've done that already.

927
02:05:26,335 --> 02:05:27,885
I'm going with you.

928
02:06:43,682 --> 02:06:46,412
It's his horse, alright. Yeah.

929
02:06:48,325 --> 02:06:50,200
No way he could have
ridden through the night.

930
02:06:50,791 --> 02:06:52,159
How far ahead?

931
02:06:53,091 --> 02:06:56,658
- Half a day at the most.
- Could be Ree.

932
02:06:57,767 --> 02:06:59,228
If they aren't his, we lose him.

933
02:07:00,510 --> 02:07:03,713
He must get re-enlisted so he
can justify killing again.

934
02:07:04,714 --> 02:07:06,422
This tracks right here are his.

935
02:07:08,547 --> 02:07:09,654
Come on.

936
02:07:16,659 --> 02:07:18,888
I can't remember my wife's face.

937
02:07:19,997 --> 02:07:22,208
Last week she was still with me.

938
02:07:24,183 --> 02:07:25,543
Now she's gone.

939
02:07:28,943 --> 02:07:32,022
I worry I won't recognize her
when I get back home.

940
02:07:44,700 --> 02:07:46,431
Is it true you killed an officer?

941
02:07:51,346 --> 02:07:54,520
I just killed a man who was
trying to kill my son.

942
02:08:13,449 --> 02:08:16,972
- Smoke.
- How close?

943
02:08:22,399 --> 02:08:24,285
No more than a mile up that way.

944
02:08:25,036 --> 02:08:27,984
I'm gonna head up to the west
you go down to the east ...

945
02:08:28,412 --> 02:08:32,849
- See if we can find some tracks.
- What if it's the Ree?

946
02:08:33,944 --> 02:08:37,604
If it's the Ree, you turn right back
around and meet me back here.

947
02:10:03,063 --> 02:10:04,088
Hey!

948
02:10:06,284 --> 02:10:08,442
I wouldn't expect to find
a man of your stature ...

949
02:10:09,381 --> 02:10:11,218
...so far away from his stove when ...

950
02:10:11,253 --> 02:10:13,539
...the morning is so cold as this.
Captain, are you lost?

951
02:10:14,126 --> 02:10:16,268
I'm here to take you
back to Fort Kahowa.

952
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:18,740
Where you will be
trialed for murder.

953
02:10:19,303 --> 02:10:20,520
Yes sir?

954
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:23,121
I ain't crazy about your plan.

955
02:10:23,725 --> 02:10:25,553
Beside, I got one of my own.

956
02:17:54,261 --> 02:17:56,303
We had a deal glass.

957
02:18:00,178 --> 02:18:02,330
I tried to tell your boy, alright?

958
02:18:02,481 --> 02:18:05,510
I tried to tell him what was happening,
but he won't listen ...

959
02:18:05,558 --> 02:18:09,340
And he kept on screaming. And he was
gonna get everybody killed.

960
02:18:11,634 --> 02:18:12,727
You and me...

961
02:18:13,153 --> 02:18:14,374
...we had a deal.

962
02:18:16,585 --> 02:18:18,242
We all know what happened out there.

963
02:18:19,362 --> 02:18:21,322
And on my soul to Lord.

964
02:18:21,429 --> 02:18:23,787
Lord he knows what happened out there.

965
02:18:27,082 --> 02:18:28,594
There was no deal.

966
02:18:31,818 --> 02:18:33,392
You killed my boy.

967
02:18:37,270 --> 02:18:39,176
Maybe you should have raised a man ...

968
02:18:39,377 --> 02:18:41,526
...instead of a some
girlie little bitch.

969
02:18:52,987 --> 02:18:54,514
God dammit!

970
02:21:18,005 --> 02:21:21,159
You came all this way
just for your revenge?

971
02:21:24,726 --> 02:21:26,108
Well you enjoy it Glass.

972
02:21:27,383 --> 02:21:30,284
Cause there ain't nothing
gonna bring your boy back.

973
02:21:53,838 --> 02:22:01,285
Revenge is in God's hands...

974
02:22:01,529 --> 02:22:03,128
...not mine.

975
02:22:08,529 --> 02:22:11,128
Synced and words corrected as much as possible.
