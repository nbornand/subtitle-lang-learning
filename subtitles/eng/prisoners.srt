Prisoners of the Sun - Part 1

3
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:59,436
Just think... Tomorrow we'll
see old Cuthbert again.

4
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:01,931
Hmmm, yes.

5
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:04,978
Why so glum? Things are looking up.

6
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:08,900
I guess so, but I can't help feeling
we're being watched.

7
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,505
Aah, enjoy yourself. Look around you!

8
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:14,338
Amazing!

9
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:16,820
Look at that!

10
00:03:21,092 --> 00:03:23,627
Look! A Llama!

11
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:26,989
Careful, Señor!

12
00:03:27,236 --> 00:03:31,071
Why? Such a nice Llama!
Kitchy, kitchy, kitchy!

13
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,091
Thundering typhoons!

14
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,178
C'mon, Captain, it's time to
get back to the hotel!

15
00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:43,234
When Llama angry, Senor, he always do that.

16
00:03:43,894 --> 00:03:47,649
Filthy animal!
Blistering barnacle of a brute.

17
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,968
Those things shouldn't be allowed!

18
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:09,383
There's the inspector...
Huh!

19
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,697
Thomson & Thomson?

20
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:15,003
Interpol has sent us to
back up the inspector

21
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,737
on this this delicate mission.

22
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,784
Precisely...

23
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,095
And where's the "Pachacamac"?

24
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:21,508
Out there.

25
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:22,978
Beside the little tug,

26
00:04:23,184 --> 00:04:24,174
with the the red funnel.

27
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:26,340
Let's have a look at this.

28
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:30,382
Ah! There she is.

29
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:32,183
Thundering typhoons!

30
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:34,624
Infectious disease on board!

31
00:04:34,869 --> 00:04:38,783
It will be impossible to search
the ship until the port health
authorities have released her.

32
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:42,710
Hm! Another convenient coincidence?

33
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:48,616
Those doctors are taking forever.

34
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:59,000
Captain, just what is this "guano" stuff?

35
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,877
Guano?

36
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:02,744
Er, um!

37
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:05,907
How shall I put it?

38
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:09,156
Well, there's a sample of it!

39
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,641
Capitain! Look! A new flag...

40
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:20,466
Quarantined!

41
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:24,479
We wouldn't be able to board her
for days... maybe weeks!

42
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,485
You can't do this, Tintin.
It might be cholera...

43
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,074
the plague... yellow fever...!

44
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:32,675
I think they know we're on to them.

45
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:36,369
and I'll bet every man on that ship
is as healthy as you and me.

46
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,056
Well, what about the sharks, then?

47
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:41,458
Nuts to the sharks!

48
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:44,258
OK, stop, this is close enough!

49
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:46,741
Be a good boy, Snowy!

50
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:50,858
Good luck, lad!

51
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,288
Que pasa ahi abajo?

52
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:34,359
Que ha pasado, Chiquito?

53
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,921
No, es nada,
debe de ser el gato.

54
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:47,325
He's going back to his cabin.

55
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:54,046
<i>Excuse me.
A little further to the west.</i>

56
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,432
Professor Calculus!

57
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,816
Professor, wake up!
Professor!

58
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:05,820
The mummy's bracelet...!

59
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:15,067
Si...!, the bracelet of Rascar Capac.

60
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,901
What do you want with poor Calculus?

61
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:21,003
Your friend has donned the sacred
bracelet of the Incas...

62
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:22,528
That is sacrilege!.

63
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,732
The punishment for that is death!.

64
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,433
- Alonzo!
- No!

65
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,806
You there! Stop!

66
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,361
Devil! You'll pay for this!

67
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,883
Iconoclasts!

68
00:07:46,522 --> 00:07:47,559
Pirates!

69
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:51,540
Guano gatherers! Murderers!

70
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,957
Let's get out of here!

71
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:03,242
Professor's Calculus' life is
in danger, Captain!.

72
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:04,718
We've got to get help.

73
00:08:04,753 --> 00:08:08,827
You alert the police!
I'll stay here and watch the ship.

74
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:14,187
Whew! At last!

75
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:15,188
Come on... come on!

76
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:23,008
- Si...
- Thundering typhoons!

77
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:24,748
Get me the Chief Inspector!

78
00:08:24,783 --> 00:08:26,855
- He's asleep, Senor.
- Then wake him!

79
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:28,256
This is urgent!

80
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:33,358
Blistering blundered! He hung up.

81
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:38,685
Somebody's coming ashore.

82
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,601
Blue Blistering Barnacles!
I can't stand here all night!

83
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:45,566
Are you going to answer it?

84
00:08:46,174 --> 00:08:48,325
Certainly not! I'm asleep!

85
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:49,465
You can't be asleep,

86
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:51,014
You're talking to me!

87
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:53,066
You know very well that

88
00:08:53,118 --> 00:08:54,514
I talk in my sleep...

89
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,534
Lazy bones! Next time it's your turn!

90
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,611
Thomson!?

91
00:09:00,861 --> 00:09:03,376
And about time, too!

92
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:06,973
Great snakes!
They're carrying somebody ashore!

93
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:10,539
It's got to be the Professor...

94
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,140
Tintin...!Tintin...! Tintin...!

95
00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:24,949
No use shouting ourselves hoarse.
Tintin's gone.

96
00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:26,507
Let's try to pick up his tracks...

97
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:30,786
It's like looking for a
needle in a haystack...

98
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:34,234
To be precise, we look like needles in a...

99
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,196
Ah... aah... isn't this the
Professors' pendulum?

100
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,057
Without a shadow of a lout...

101
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:44,077
er, shadow of a doubt.

102
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:45,072
Over here.

103
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:47,342
Look at these footprints...

104
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:50,391
several men with Llamas.

105
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:52,976
- Question is, which way did they go?
- I know.

106
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:54,342
Nothing simpler.

107
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,177
Cuthbert's pendulum?!

108
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:57,782
Spot on!

109
00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:01,426
And this utensil is going to
lead us directly to its owner.

110
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:05,343
Dowsing is a question of
having the right touch.

111
00:10:05,993 --> 00:10:08,509
See? The pendulum is pointing south.

112
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:10,512
Then south we must go.

113
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,242
If you don't mind, I'm heading north.

114
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,439
- Suit yourself.
- I'd better go and investigate...

115
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,640
That is to say, we better
go and investigate...

116
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:21,686
And keep your eyes open...!

117
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:23,729
Never you mind, they're open...

118
00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:25,491
To be precise they're...

119
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:37,627
Excuse me, son. Have you seen a
young lad with a little white dog?

120
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,816
Yes, indeed and I know him well.

121
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,477
Tintin!?

122
00:10:42,662 --> 00:10:43,632
Snowy!

123
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:45,333
What about Cuthbert?

124
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:47,122
We haven't got a moment to lose.

125
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:50,374
I overheard the kidnappers
say they were heading for Jauga.

126
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:53,626
If we hurry, we just might
catch up with them by train..

127
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:08,762
What a mob!
This train is going to be crammed.

128
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,290
Have a good trip, Señores.

129
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:53,604
Ow!... Thundering typhoons!

130
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:57,666
That's odd! There's not another
soul in this carriage.

131
00:11:57,669 --> 00:11:59,686
We're alone... strange.

132
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,406
We must be pretty high up.
We've been climbing steadily for hours...

133
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,551
Hello... We're slowing down!

134
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:11,008
We must be coming to a station...

135
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:14,215
What!?

136
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:15,323
Oh! No!

137
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:17,550
Captain! Our section has been unhooked.

138
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:19,108
What?

139
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,109
Blistering Barnacles!

140
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:23,596
- Quick. Jump!.
- Jump?

141
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:38,760
Snowy, Snowy... come on!

142
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,540
We're going too fast!

143
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,792
A river.

144
00:12:49,074 --> 00:12:51,583
This is our only chance, Snowy.

145
00:13:05,362 --> 00:13:06,351
Snowy?

146
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:08,317
Oh, good boy!

147
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:16,883
We can thank our lucky stars we got out!

148
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:23,324
I wonder what's become of the Captain?

149
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:25,364
I wonder what's become of Tintin?

150
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,049
Hey! Stop!

151
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:33,912
Thank goodness you're save!
Such an unfortunate accident...

152
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:37,043
That was no accident!

153
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:40,367
We must get to Jauga as fast
as possible.

154
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:43,929
Well, not much help from the police...

155
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:47,488
he seemed to be afraid
to even talk to us.

156
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:50,291
Let's split up and question
some of the locals.

157
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:52,140
Right.

158
00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:55,373
His name is Calculus. A short man...

159
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:58,093
with a little beard... wearing glasses?

160
00:13:58,694 --> 00:13:59,594
No say...

161
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:01,890
- About this high?
- No say...

162
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,769
- Had a little beard.
- No say.

163
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:10,009
- With spectacles.
- No say.

164
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,210
No say... no say... no say...

165
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:18,415
"No say! No say!"
Blistering barnacles!

166
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,174
They all seem to be afraid.

167
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,897
One last try... that young orange seller.

168
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:28,412
The bullies!

169
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,784
Aren't you ashamed bullying
a child like that?

170
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,585
Why...? You...!

171
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:40,668
Go for it, Pedro!

172
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,607
Young swine. You little rat!

173
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:49,111
Stand still, smart guy...!

174
00:14:50,777 --> 00:14:53,650
Yeoww...!

175
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:55,513
Wait, you little...!

176
00:14:56,114 --> 00:15:00,714
Yeoww...!
Yeoww...!

177
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:01,681
Good boy, Snowy!

178
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:08,922
Well, I'm no further ahead.

179
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:12,521
- Pssst... Senor?
- What?... Who...

180
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,246
Please be quiet, Senor!
Pretend to tie your shoelace.

181
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:18,650
I know where you can find
the man you're looking for.

182
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:23,275
Tomorrow at dawn come
to the bridge of the Inca.

183
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:26,490
You go now! It is dangerous
for me to be here!

184
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,920
I just hope it's not a trap.

185
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,000
You listen, Senor!

186
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:36,173
I see you help Indian boy.

187
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:40,485
You are brave. But you not go
and search for your friend.

188
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:43,082
Look! I don't know who you are.

189
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,851
But I'll tell you, I would never
abandon a friend.

190
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:47,921
That is foolish!

191
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:49,683
But take this...

192
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:52,449
it may save your life...

193
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:14,634
So where is this guide of yours?

194
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:16,235
Psst... psst...

195
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:21,447
It's the little orange seller.

196
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,519
So it was you?

197
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,720
No make noise.

198
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,029
If Indians see us...

199
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:27,881
they kill us.

200
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,890
You come now!

201
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:37,650
You wait here!

202
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,050
I don't like this.

203
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:43,219
Thundering Typhoons!

204
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,881
Not another pair of
perambulating fire-pumps!

205
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:51,969
Llamas very gentle, Senor
You not be afraid.

206
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:53,812
Afraid? Me?
Eyeoww!

207
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,838
You miserable iconoclast!

208
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:00,238
No hit, Señor!

209
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,565
- When Llama angry...
- I know!

210
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,125
"He always do that. "

211
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:08,682
Blistering barnacles!

212
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:12,575
You know... we don't even know your name?

213
00:17:12,784 --> 00:17:13,581
Zorrino, Senor.

214
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:18,406
Well, Zorrino... you can tell me now,
where is our friend?

215
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:20,247
He's taken to the Inca.

216
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:24,922
The inca? I thought the last
of the Incas died 400 years ago?

217
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,808
Many things you not know.

218
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:28,969
Where is this Inca, then?

219
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:31,104
The temple of the sun, Senor.

220
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:33,213
Your friend is the prisoner of Sun God.

221
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:36,886
Temple of the sun? Sun God?

222
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,954
There is "Chulpa", Señor.

223
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:43,991
We spend the night there.

224
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:48,674
Good night, Captain!
Make sure you wake me for my watch.

225
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:50,635
I will. Sleep well, you two...

226
00:17:51,643 --> 00:17:52,680
Good night Zorrino...

227
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:54,637
Good night, Senor Tintin.

228
00:17:56,927 --> 00:18:00,682
Amazing! An Inca plant in bloom...!

229
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:05,368
Excuse me, Señor Inca!

230
00:18:07,131 --> 00:18:09,442
Have you a Licence for that gun...?

231
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:12,328
Licence?
Licence...?!

232
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:15,044
Sacrilege! Sacrilege!

233
00:18:15,255 --> 00:18:17,976
The fire of heaven will strike you down!

234
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:33,658
Good heavens!

235
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:35,299
They let me sleep on.

236
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:37,335
Captain?

237
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:40,501
Captain?

238
00:18:41,228 --> 00:18:42,661
Zorrino?

239
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,468
Great snakes! Where could they be?

240
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:50,022
Captain!

241
00:18:53,874 --> 00:18:54,751
What have you found, Snowy?

242
00:18:59,518 --> 00:19:01,031
What's going on?

243
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,029
Cut the cords and get me out
of this before I go crazy!

244
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,299
Hurry!

245
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:12,057
Billions of blue
blistering barnacles!

246
00:19:12,503 --> 00:19:13,438
Got it!

247
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:18,180
This miserable reptile has spent the
night waltzing along my spine!

248
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:24,778
Well, whoever they are they got

249
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:29,589
our Llamas, our supplies, our guns
and they got Zorrino!

250
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,872
But there's one thing they missed...

251
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:34,110
Zorrino's hat.

252
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:36,570
Snowy! Snowy, here boy!

253
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:39,575
It's up to you now, Snowy...

254
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:43,093
Find Zorrino, Snowy! Find him!

255
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,613
Come on! After him!

256
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,518
Hey! Not so fast, you mountain goat!

257
00:19:54,348 --> 00:19:56,625
There they are!
They'll pass directly below us!

258
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:00,262
If we take a short cut down the
cliff we can surprise them!

259
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:01,825
Snowy... you stay here!

260
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:04,503
More likely
we'll break our necks.

261
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:15,875
Better find another way, Captain...
This is very steep...!

262
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:31,239
Blistering typhoons!

263
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:32,594
Don't move!

264
00:20:33,644 --> 00:20:34,723
Captain!

265
00:20:35,464 --> 00:20:36,959
Que pasa?

266
00:20:40,728 --> 00:20:43,124
You tell us, where is your friend?

267
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:44,125
No say!

268
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:46,042
Tell us or die!

269
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,602
Well... What do you know!
He's right behind you!

270
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:52,506
- You! No joke!
- No joke!

271
00:20:53,593 --> 00:20:54,969
Hands up!

272
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:56,369
I'll take that.

273
00:20:56,895 --> 00:20:59,616
Untie Zorrino, Captain.
I'll keep an eye on them.

274
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:02,355
Good to see you, little one.

275
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,671
Thank you, my friends.

276
00:21:12,323 --> 00:21:13,552
Look out!

277
00:21:16,164 --> 00:21:17,519
Hooray!

278
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:22,396
Thundering typhoons!

279
00:21:22,887 --> 00:21:26,485
And anyone who crosses our
path again is a dead duck!

280
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:29,850
You... just... wait!

281
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:32,725
Thank you for saving me, Senor Tintin!

282
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:34,673
We wouldn't abandon you, Zorrino.

283
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:36,470
But where is Snowy?

284
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:40,025
Snowy!

285
00:21:41,477 --> 00:21:43,236
I have news of your friend, Señores.

286
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:44,867
Professor Calculus?

287
00:21:45,118 --> 00:21:49,038
I hear Indians talking. They're only
about a half day ahead of us.

288
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,961
Maybe we catch them soon if we hurry.

289
00:21:52,202 --> 00:21:55,356
That's good news, Zorrino.
Let's get going!

290
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:58,837
You sure we can't do it...

291
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:01,960
without these
cushion-footed ruminants?

292
00:22:02,168 --> 00:22:03,648
Oh, no, Señor!

293
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:05,440
Llamas is very helpful.

294
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:09,328
Very gentle, Senor...
You try to be friends, you see...

295
00:22:11,072 --> 00:22:13,248
Blistering barnacles!

296
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:17,749
<i><b>Fast Forward to Part 2
for the conclusion...</b></i>

297
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,930
Prisoners of the Sun - Part 2

298
00:26:43,031 --> 00:26:46,307
Okay, Snowy! We're coming.
We're coming!

299
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,780
- Snowy!
- A condor has taken him.

300
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,062
He'll be eaten alive.

301
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,464
Maybe I can scare it off...

302
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:11,182
There! Snowy's safe for the time being.

303
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:13,178
But I gotta work fast!

304
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:14,981
What are you going to do?

305
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:17,659
I'm gonna get Snowy down from there...

306
00:27:26,988 --> 00:27:27,943
Be careful!

307
00:27:28,988 --> 00:27:30,182
Snowy...!

308
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:35,856
I hope he's okay?

309
00:27:38,027 --> 00:27:39,016
Snowy!

310
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:44,542
Well, hello to you too.

311
00:27:45,147 --> 00:27:46,135
Is he okay...?

312
00:27:51,506 --> 00:27:53,576
Now hold still!

313
00:27:56,486 --> 00:27:57,780
Heads up!

314
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:05,743
Blistering typoons!

315
00:28:06,265 --> 00:28:07,584
The condor's back!

316
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:11,653
Look out, Tintin!

317
00:28:14,684 --> 00:28:16,258
Hey! No, no!

318
00:28:24,544 --> 00:28:26,853
Hang on, Snowy!

319
00:28:33,183 --> 00:28:34,855
Tintin, Tintin!

320
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:36,655
Are you okay?

321
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,972
Blistering barnacles!

322
00:28:52,142 --> 00:28:53,631
Hmm... how peculiar.

323
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:57,756
The pendulum says that
they are somewhere... high up.

324
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,612
Ha... cheeh!... Blistering barnacles!

325
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,811
Ouch! Blue blistering barnacles!

326
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:33,768
Aagh...!

327
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:38,211
...how it could kill you...

328
00:29:38,446 --> 00:29:41,409
- Yes...
- Quite!

329
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:37,689
Alright... Snowy, leave me alone!

330
00:30:43,614 --> 00:30:45,386
We'll have to try and cross here.

331
00:30:45,487 --> 00:30:47,259
It's our only chance!

332
00:30:47,294 --> 00:30:49,170
Give me the rope, Zorrino.

333
00:30:51,173 --> 00:30:52,811
Here goes.

334
00:30:57,173 --> 00:30:58,322
Now... who's first?

335
00:30:59,013 --> 00:31:02,892
I go first to show rope very strong.

336
00:31:04,972 --> 00:31:06,325
He's got guts that boy.

337
00:31:10,892 --> 00:31:13,170
Thundering typhoons!

338
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:16,250
You need a cool head for this!

339
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:17,727
Oops! My hat!

340
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:20,959
For heaven's sake, Captain!
Forget your hat...

341
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:26,049
Not on your life!
This hat means a lot to me...!

342
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,169
Okay, come on!

343
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,846
Our turn, Snowy!

344
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:45,204
Hang on, Snowy! We're nearly there!

345
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:47,005
Aaah...!

346
00:31:50,706 --> 00:31:53,106
Tintin?!... Tintin...!

347
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:04,241
Tintin not dead, is he, Captain?

348
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:07,679
My poor Zorrino, Tintin is gone.

349
00:32:07,888 --> 00:32:10,880
We'll never see him again... ever!

350
00:32:10,968 --> 00:32:14,444
Hey...! Captain! Zorrino...!

351
00:32:16,487 --> 00:32:20,301
That voice! I must be dreaming!
It can't be!

352
00:32:30,086 --> 00:32:30,882
Captain!

353
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:34,478
I'm behind the waterfall!
Throw me a rope!

354
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,039
Hang on, Tintin!

355
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:40,245
Here it comes.

356
00:32:42,486 --> 00:32:43,379
Got it!

357
00:32:43,225 --> 00:32:45,353
- Come on in!
- In there?

358
00:32:45,805 --> 00:32:50,495
Yes, in here... you have to see this!
Don't worry, it's only a thin

359
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:51,677
curtain of water.

360
00:32:52,165 --> 00:32:53,962
If you say so...

361
00:33:01,524 --> 00:33:03,321
Blistering barnacles!

362
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:05,322
Remarkable, isn't it?

363
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:07,998
Where are we?

364
00:33:08,683 --> 00:33:10,799
Incredible!

365
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:14,920
Come on, Zorrino...!

366
00:33:15,803 --> 00:33:17,600
- Zorrino!
- Tintin!

367
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:19,752
What do you think, Captain?

368
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:22,454
I would say we've stumbled into some long-

369
00:33:22,463 --> 00:33:24,758
forgotten entrance to
the temple of the sun...

370
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:27,760
It'll be dark as the belly
of a whale in there.

371
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:29,251
No... I had a look...

372
00:33:29,562 --> 00:33:32,078
the rock is some sort of phosphorous mineral

373
00:33:32,082 --> 00:33:34,237
that actually gives off light!

374
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:38,073
I've got a hunch

375
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,279
we're not far from Professor Calculus.

376
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:45,953
Huh! Oh-oh...

377
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:48,638
Looks like a dead end!

378
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,239
I think Snowy's found something.

379
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,234
Where are you going?

380
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,759
Good boy, Snowy!

381
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,960
Wow...!

382
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,352
Inca Mummies!

383
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,833
This must be some kind of tomb...!

384
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:20,128
If I'm not mistaken, Snowy, this looks
like it could be a secret doorway.

385
00:34:21,138 --> 00:34:22,327
Tintin?

386
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:31,117
Blistering barnacles!

387
00:34:31,317 --> 00:34:33,512
Give me a hand!

388
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:40,388
Now! Where the devil are...?!

389
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:44,991
- Who's that?
- Look, Captain!

390
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:47,156
Help me give this slab a push!

391
00:34:47,696 --> 00:34:50,547
Right! I sure don't feel like
hanging about in here!

392
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:54,269
I don't think I like the company.

393
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:57,867
One, two, three... heave..!

394
00:35:04,255 --> 00:35:06,785
It moved! And again!

395
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:09,748
One, two, three...!

396
00:35:14,755 --> 00:35:17,826
Sacrilege! Seize them!

397
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:36,742
Sea gherkins!

398
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:42,747
Ectoplasms! Poltroons! Terrorists!

399
00:35:47,632 --> 00:35:50,510
Don't cry, Zorrino...
We'll get out of this, you'll see.

400
00:35:58,432 --> 00:36:00,023
Oh.. The medallion!

401
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:07,140
<i>...but take this medallion...
it may save your life...</i>

402
00:36:08,951 --> 00:36:11,622
I wonder... here, Zorrino...

403
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,943
Take good care of this,
it might come in handy.

404
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,703
Strangers... you have
violated the sacred temple.

405
00:36:29,949 --> 00:36:33,259
You must pay for this sacrilege
with your lives.

406
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:37,608
Do you really think we'd let ourselves
get massacred just like that?

407
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:39,481
You tin-hatted tyrant!

408
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:43,019
Noble Prince of the Sun,
we have never sought to commit sacrilege.

409
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:46,226
We were simply looking
for our friend, Professor Calculus.

410
00:36:46,468 --> 00:36:50,866
Your friend dared to wear the
sacred bracelet of Rascar Capac.

411
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:52,899
He too will be put to death.

412
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:55,862
Blistering barnacles!
You've no right to kill him!

413
00:36:55,968 --> 00:36:57,659
It's murder. Pure and simple!

414
00:36:57,907 --> 00:37:00,296
But it is not we who will put you to death.

415
00:37:00,507 --> 00:37:02,975
It is the sun itself.

416
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:06,497
It's rays will set alight your pyre.

417
00:37:06,707 --> 00:37:09,346
As for this young Indian who betrayed us...

418
00:37:10,046 --> 00:37:12,644
he will be sacrificed at once

419
00:37:12,686 --> 00:37:14,258
on the altar of the Sun God...

420
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:19,081
Billions of Blistering blue barnacles! Don't
you dare touch a hair on this boy's head!

421
00:37:19,086 --> 00:37:21,053
Zorrino, the medallion.

422
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:26,734
Where did you steal that,

423
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:27,855
little viper?

424
00:37:28,305 --> 00:37:30,779
I not steal, Prince of the Sun.

425
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:33,130
He... he gave me this medallion.

426
00:37:33,165 --> 00:37:36,882
I beg leave to speak. It is I,
noble Prince of the Sun...

427
00:37:36,925 --> 00:37:38,342
who gave the sacred token

428
00:37:38,344 --> 00:37:39,819
to the young stranger.

429
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:43,614
You, Huascar?
A high priest of the Sun God...

430
00:37:43,615 --> 00:37:46,115
You gave this talisman to our enemy?

431
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:50,223
I did so, because he showed great
courage in defense of one of our race.

432
00:37:50,463 --> 00:37:52,852
He is not an enemy, O Noble Prince.

433
00:37:53,463 --> 00:37:57,342
Good, Huascar, your action
will save the young Indian.

434
00:37:57,543 --> 00:37:59,898
But the two strangers must
be sacrified to the sun.

435
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:03,819
However, I will grant them one favor.

436
00:38:04,062 --> 00:38:06,432
They may choose the day and the hour

437
00:38:06,582 --> 00:38:08,015
when the rays of the sacred sun

438
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:11,934
will light their pyre,
within the next 30 days.

439
00:38:11,942 --> 00:38:15,370
Let the strangers be taken away
and confine them till tomorrow.

440
00:38:15,382 --> 00:38:19,332
The Prince of the Sun has spoken...!

441
00:38:20,901 --> 00:38:24,652
Well... We're up to our necks this time!

442
00:38:25,341 --> 00:38:26,355
Huh...!

443
00:38:29,356 --> 00:38:33,056
Thundering typhoons!

444
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,579
Where did you find this newspaper?

445
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,695
Have you forgotten? You told me
to keep it to light a fire.

446
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:49,131
Won't be needing it now.
There'll be fire alright.

447
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:52,164
Now where are they?

448
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,933
The pendulum says they're very low.

449
00:38:57,059 --> 00:38:59,678
Hmmm... now that's interesting.

450
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:01,570
What's the date today? The 15th?

451
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:04,736
Yes, if it makes any difference!

452
00:39:05,118 --> 00:39:06,817
The tomorrow's the 16th!

453
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,169
Eureka! We're saved.

454
00:39:09,818 --> 00:39:12,013
Thundering typhoon!
What's the matter with you?

455
00:39:12,378 --> 00:39:13,556
I can't tell you now.

456
00:39:13,557 --> 00:39:15,027
But we'll be alright!

457
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:18,093
The most important thing
for you to do is trust me

458
00:39:18,137 --> 00:39:21,529
and do exactly as I say...
You'll understand later.

459
00:39:27,296 --> 00:39:28,854
Well, strangers...

460
00:39:29,057 --> 00:39:32,093
have you decided on the day
and the hour of your death?

461
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:34,414
Yes, Noble Prince of the Sun.

462
00:39:34,516 --> 00:39:37,255
This very afternoon at precisely 4 O'clock.

463
00:39:37,496 --> 00:39:40,010
Today is my friend the Captain's
birthday and I...

464
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:42,325
Have you gone crazy? You know it isn't...

465
00:39:42,335 --> 00:39:44,612
Captain... you promised to trust me.

466
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:46,529
Guards...! Take them away!

467
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:49,847
The ceremony will take place
at the appointed hour.

468
00:40:00,814 --> 00:40:04,109
You were so keen to see us
roasting on this barbecue!

469
00:40:04,214 --> 00:40:05,489
So... here we are...

470
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:08,089
Trust me, Captain.

471
00:40:21,013 --> 00:40:22,612
Captain! There! Calculus!

472
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:25,413
After all the time we've
spent searching for him!

473
00:40:25,652 --> 00:40:28,803
Now we'll have all eternity
with him in the ever-after.

474
00:40:30,652 --> 00:40:31,951
Why, Captain...

475
00:40:31,952 --> 00:40:34,322
what a delightful surprise!

476
00:40:34,572 --> 00:40:35,800
How are you?

477
00:40:36,012 --> 00:40:39,004
Ohh... just dandy, Cuthbert.

478
00:40:39,212 --> 00:40:40,849
And you too, my dear Tintin!

479
00:40:41,092 --> 00:40:44,401
But tell me... what is all this performance?
Where are we?

480
00:40:44,811 --> 00:40:46,410
We're with the Incas.

481
00:40:46,971 --> 00:40:48,529
Ahh...! The cinema! Good!

482
00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:52,162
You must congratulate the director for me!

483
00:40:52,171 --> 00:40:54,684
What a clever
historical reconstruction!

484
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:58,102
Look at those extras... so natural.

485
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,690
Who would believe they're acting?

486
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,604
Let the sacrifice begin!

487
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,717
No! You can't! You can't!

488
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,725
What are we doing here?

489
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:18,286
According to the pendulum
they must be in a hot spot.

490
00:41:21,728 --> 00:41:24,561
O Pachacamac,
Lord of the day!

491
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:28,317
Strike now with thine avenging rays!

492
00:41:33,288 --> 00:41:35,655
O Magnificent Sun!

493
00:41:35,668 --> 00:41:39,004
Do not heed your son's prayers!

494
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,322
Show all those present

495
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:43,081
that our death is not your desire.

496
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:47,685
Silence, dog!
How dare you call on the Sun!

497
00:41:48,247 --> 00:41:50,806
O sublime Pachacamac!

498
00:41:51,006 --> 00:41:53,918
If this sacrifice is not thy will...

499
00:41:54,126 --> 00:41:56,321
hide thy shining face from us!

500
00:41:56,886 --> 00:42:00,162
Poor Tintin! He's lost his mind.

501
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:04,041
Blistering Barnacles! What's happening?

502
00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:21,278
An eclipse!

503
00:42:21,484 --> 00:42:24,044
Haha! An eclipse!

504
00:42:24,244 --> 00:42:26,394
No reason to panic, Captain.

505
00:42:26,604 --> 00:42:28,356
It's only an eclipse, that's all...

506
00:42:33,163 --> 00:42:34,899
Mercy! Mercy! I implore you!

507
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,200
Make the sun show his light again.

508
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,997
I will grant whatever you desire.

509
00:42:39,163 --> 00:42:40,873
My desire is that the curse of

510
00:42:40,874 --> 00:42:43,474
Rascar Capac be lifted
from the 7 explorers

511
00:42:43,783 --> 00:42:45,480
who came to your temple.

512
00:42:45,682 --> 00:42:47,133
They came seeking only knowledge

513
00:42:47,134 --> 00:42:51,234
of what they believe was
a long forgotten culture.

514
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:52,279
So be it! You have my word!

515
00:42:53,082 --> 00:42:56,279
O Sun,
Lord of the day!

516
00:42:56,482 --> 00:42:58,871
Show mercy, I pray thee!

517
00:42:59,081 --> 00:43:02,596
Pity thy children!
And show thy light once more!

518
00:43:03,161 --> 00:43:05,800
By Rascar Camac... the Sun obeys him!

519
00:43:06,361 --> 00:43:07,396
Quickly! Set them free!

520
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:10,111
Your newspaper saved us, Captain.

521
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,433
Life is magnificent!

522
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,550
Life is magnificent!

523
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,748
Now what?

524
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:34,508
It says they're
getting bumped about.

525
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:40,018
These wax images enabled
me to maintain my spell

526
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:41,376
over the men for whom you plead.

527
00:43:41,379 --> 00:43:42,997
But what about the crystal balls?

528
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:44,228
What were they for?

529
00:43:44,678 --> 00:43:47,909
They contain a mystic liquid
obtained from Coco which...

530
00:43:48,118 --> 00:43:50,837
plunged the victims into a deep sleep...

531
00:43:51,038 --> 00:43:52,756
the perfect state for enchantment.

532
00:44:12,836 --> 00:44:15,873
Goodbye, Zorrino.
Your place is here now.

533
00:44:16,076 --> 00:44:17,987
Farewell, Tintin, my friend.

534
00:44:18,236 --> 00:44:21,751
Before you leave, Noble strangers!
I too have a favour to ask of you.

535
00:44:22,236 --> 00:44:24,908
I know what you're about to say,
Noble Prince of the Sun!

536
00:44:25,115 --> 00:44:26,833
And you need have no fears about that!

537
00:44:27,595 --> 00:44:31,429
I will never reveal to anyone the
whereabouts of the Temple of the Sun.

538
00:44:31,915 --> 00:44:33,234
Me too! I swear it!

539
00:44:33,435 --> 00:44:37,428
May... my beard be barbecued if
I breathe so much as a word!

540
00:44:37,794 --> 00:44:41,982
Likewise! I swear I will never
again act in another film,

541
00:44:41,994 --> 00:44:45,912
however glittering
the Hollywood contract!

542
00:45:00,353 --> 00:45:03,389
Adios, Señores.
And may the sun shine upon you!

543
00:45:03,793 --> 00:45:06,671
Hang on a sec! Don't leave just yet!

544
00:45:19,831 --> 00:45:21,388
Nothing against you, personally,

545
00:45:21,689 --> 00:45:24,789
but that pays a very old debt...

546
00:45:29,391 --> 00:45:31,846
Let's go home, Captain.

547
00:45:31,747 --> 00:45:36,747
The End...

548
00:45:37,305 --> 00:45:43,693
