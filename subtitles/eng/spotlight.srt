00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:00,843
- How's that going?

6
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:03,094
- Mother's ballin' and
the uncle is pissed off.

7
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:04,655
She's not married?

8
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:06,858
Divorced, with 4 kids.

9
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,203
I guess the Father
was helping out.

10
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:10,787
Helping out?

11
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:15,755
- Hey, Mr. Burke, they're in
the back talking to the Bishop.

12
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:17,048
And Father?

13
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:18,360
We put him in the break room.

14
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:19,922
- Any press?

15
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:22,467
Some guy from the Citizen
but we sent him away.

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,569
None of the big papers.

17
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:25,222
Let's keep it that way.

18
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:27,091
Who's that?

19
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:28,803
Assistant D.A.

20
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:31,594
It's gonna be hard to keep
the papers from arraignment.

21
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:33,444
What arraignment?

22
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:38,663
- You can tell Father Geoghan
it won't be much longer.

23
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,221
Now Sheila, you know what
I'm going to work...

24
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,501
The Church does
serve to community...

25
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,630
But I give you
my personal guaranty...

26
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,681
that I'm going to take Father
out of the parish....

27
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,111
and this will
never happen again.

28
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:56,871
We'll just be
another moment Paul.

29
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:58,467
Of course Father.

30
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,641
Now Sheila, I'm going to give
you my personal card.

32
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:42,110

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,553

But losing one
of our best...

36
00:02:46,993 --> 00:02:49,671
Well, to put it this
eloquently as I can.

37
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:50,991
It's a real
kick in the ass.

38
00:02:51,994 --> 00:02:54,066
But, Robby here
has known Stewart...

39
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,611
...longer than most
of you been alive.

40
00:02:56,706 --> 00:02:58,116
So I'll handed off to him.
- Robby.

41
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,327
Oh, well, thanks Ben.
I think.

42
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:03,588
Although I take issue...

43
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:06,749
...with your reference
to my seniority.

44
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,892
I will say that Stewart's
departure is specially...

45
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,170
painful for me, because...

46
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:13,006
For what?

47
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:14,816
Stewart, 20 years now?

48
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:16,611
Stewart's been more
than willing ...

49
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:18,990
to part with his money
at a poker table.

50
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:22,266
And, I've got
a kid in college.

51
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:24,457
Yeah, but I'm
gonna keep playing.

52
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,973
Oh, problem solved.

53
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:27,785
God speed then.

54
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:31,487
Now Stewart, I find the...

55
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,913
timing of your departure...

56
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:35,676
disconcerted.

57
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,736
A corner office...

58
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:38,938

60
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,599
So I'm sorry buddy, but...

61
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:44,952
I got to ask you.

62
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:47,005
What the hell do you know?

63
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,831
How's the cake?

64
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,851
It's really good.

65
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,251
You saving yours?

66
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,401
No, that's for Mike.

67
00:04:09,441 --> 00:04:11,401
I can't ever eat those things,
they are kinda depressing.

68
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
I know.

69
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:14,301
Did you see the numbers
from Washington?

70
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:15,601
Yeah, very interesting.

71
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,111
I'm not asking if the PD is
lying, I know they're lying.

72
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:20,971
All I'm asking who's behind it?

73
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,241
Ok, I get it,
you don't wanna talk.

74
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,491
No Dan, I'm not mad,
I'm hungry.

75
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,361
I've been talking to you
so long I didn't eat lunch.

76
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,801
So I'm gonna get
something to eat...

77
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,941
and I'll give you
an hour to decide...

78
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,731
whether you want to be on
the right side of this...

79
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,150
or read about it
like everybody else.

80
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:36,331
Bye Dan.

81
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,111
You think Cahill has something?

82
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,451
Maybe. I just don't think
the story is for us.

83
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,491
- Ben likes it?

84
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,591
- Yeah, it's not bad.
It's just not Spotlight.

85
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,941
- What's just not Spotlight?

86
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,381
- PD numbers.
- The numbers story, feels thin.

87
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,261
Oh, you got Cahill to talk?

88
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,661
No, but I will.

89
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,621
Good, then know if it's thin.

90
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,941
How did it go upstairs?

91
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,941
Ok, Robby gave a good speech.

92
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:01,991
Sure he did.

93
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,540
I heard Lubin and Conor
are going to the Times.

94
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,791
- C'mon, really?
- Yeah, I heard that.

95
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,171
They are leaching us.

96
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,921
Well, at least they are sending
us a guy from Miami to run things.

97
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,721
That should help.

98
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,831
Has Baron even
spent time in Boston?

99
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,111
He's never been here before.

100
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,411
Maybe we should buy him a map.

101
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,931
I have a friend down in Miami,

102
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,231
said he cut 15% of the stuff.

103
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,921
- Great.
- Hey Robby?

104
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,121
New boss coming in
to make some cuts?

105
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,201
I have no idea.

106
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,381
Aren't you saying none of them?

107
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,381
Yes I am.

108
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,521
So is it about spotlight?

109
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,821
I don't know Mike.

110
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,891
But I do know...

111
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,891
That Ben needs an answer on
that crime number story.

112
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,090
I'm telling you, I really don't
think that story is for us.

113
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,700
Mr. Baron.

114
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,941
Walter Robinson.

115
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:44,991
- Robby.

116
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,951
- Thanks for taking
a time of your...

117
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:48,351
- Oh, it's my pleasure.
- Appreciate it.

118
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,651
- What are you reading?

119
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,641
- Curse of the Bambino.

120
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,721
Oh, yeah.

121
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,241
Great book.

122
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,531
Globe has a season
tickets at Fenway...

123
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,980
once you settle in,
by the way.

124
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,561
Thank you.

125
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,561
To be honest, I'm, I'm not
much of baseball fan...

126
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,051
I'm just trying to get
the feel for the city.

127
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,171
Oh, yeah.

128
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,131
- So, you're originally from Boston?

129
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,121
- I am, born and raised, yeah.

130
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,621
A lot of the newsroom
is from here.

131
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,171
Really feels like ah...

132
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,171
like a local paper
in that way.

133
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,469
And did that
changed at all

134
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,411
after the paper were
sold to the Times?

135
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,771
- No. I don't think
that big impact.

136
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,371
- Good.

137
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,941
And... You're an editor
for the Spotlight team.

138
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,571
I prefer to think of myself...

139
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,191
as a player coach, but yes.

140
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,191
Are you familiar with the Spotlight?

141
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,171
No, not particularly.

142
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,711
Well, we are a 4 person
investigative team.

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,741
We report to
Ben Bradlee Jr. and...

144
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,901
we keep our work confidential.

145
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,041
- What are you working on now?

146
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,041
We just put out a
piece on a shouty...

147
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,101
constraction outfit
and right now...

148
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,441
we're really just trolling
around for our next story.

149
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,081
- How long does
that typically take?

150
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,581
- Hard to say,
a couple months.

151
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,751
- Couple months?

152
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,751
Yeah, we don't like to rush it.

153
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,041
Once we settle on the project...

154
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,221
we can spend a year
or more investigating.

155
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,791
- Is that a concern?
- Not necessarily.

156
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,871
But, from what I understand
leadership is to how an internet

157
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,241
is cutting into
the classified business.

158
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,491
And, I think I'm gonna need
to take a hard look at things.

159
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,061
So...
You anticipate more cuts?

160
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,401
I think it's safe
to assume so, but...

161
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,061
what I'm more focused
on right now is...

162
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,591
finding the way to make
this paper...

163
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,111
essential to its readers.

164
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,901
I like to think
it already is.

165
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,191
Fair enough. I just think
that we can do better.

166
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,871
- Mr. Bradlee.
- Hey.

167
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,411
- Saw the PD numbers, looks interesting?
- Yeah, there's something there.

168
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,841
- How long do you need?
- Another week.

169
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,071
- Where are you going?
- 10.30.

170
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,441
Since when?

171
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,911
- Technically I am an editor.
- Technically.

172
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,521
- Your sit down with
Baron go that well?

173
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,521
- I couldn't get
a read on him.

174
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,811
That's a first.

175
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,911
How about you?

176
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,881
Oh, he's a barrel of laughs.

177
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,211
Morning everyone.
Lets get started.

178
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,711
Do you want to say
something, Marty?

179
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,811
Sure.

180
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,771
Hello.

181
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,971
As most of you
know by now...

182
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,571
my name is Marty Baron.

183
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,991
I'm... delighted
to be here.

184
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,561
If you could tell me your
name as we go around...

185
00:08:55,565 --> 00:08:57,561
that'd be helpful. Thank you.

186
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,961
- Ok, Peter.
- Peter Canellos, Metro.

187
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,391
I've got a major
big date closure...

188
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,011
- Hey, Steve.
- Mike.

189
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,171
Hey.

190
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,191
- Crappy game last night.

191
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,191
- Hm, they can't
even worth a nickel.

192
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,061
Listen, what's, what's Eileen
McNamara doing in 10.30?

193
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,021
You need something, Mike?

194
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,091
No. Just curious?

195
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,561
Go be curious somewhere else.
I got work to do.

196
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,031
- Ok Steve, see you.
- Yeah.

197
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,041
And it looks like Pedro is going
to be out till september 1st.

198
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,841
Jimmy says he could
be back this year,

199
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,521
but the doctor didn't
seem so sure.

200
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,301
Where is the pez opener?

201
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,941
- Is that everyone?
- Yes, that's it.

202
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,421
Ok, good, thank you.

203
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,121
Did everyone read Eileen
McNamara column this weekend?

204
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,661
- That's the Geoghan case?
- Yeah. What's the follow on that?

205
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,791
It's a column, what kind of
follow would you thinking?

206
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,641
Well, apparently this
priest molested kids...

207
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,901
in 6 different parishes
over the last 30 years.

208
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,081
- And the attorney
for the victims, Mr. ...

209
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,081
- Garabedian.

210
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,251
Thanks Eileen. Mr. Garabedian
says Cardinal Law...

211
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,341
found about it 15 years
ago and did nothing.

212
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,111
Yeah, I think that attorney
is a bit of crank...

213
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,601
and the Church
dismissed the claim.

214
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,951
He said, she said.

215
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,311
Whether Mr. Garabedian
is a crank or not...

216
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,611
he says he has documents
to prove that Cardinal knew.

217
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,001
And as I understand that those
documents are under a seal.

218
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,671
Ok, but the fact remains
that Boston priest...

219
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,931
abused 80 kids.
We have a lawyer...

220
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,951
who says he can prove
Law knew about it...

221
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,291
and we written all of...

222
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,291
2 stories in
the last 6 months.

223
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,501
This strikes me as
an essential story...

224
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,861
to a local paper,
I think that at very least...

225
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,041
we have to go through
those documents.

226
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,011
How would you
like to do that?

227
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,731
Well, I don't know
what the laws are here,

228
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,931
but in Florida,
we would go to Court.

229
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,141
You want to sue the Church?

230
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,701
Technically we wouldn't
sue the Church...

231
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,501
we'd file a motion to lift
the seal on those documents.

232
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,561
The Church would read
that as us suing them.

233
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,361
So will everybody else.

234
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,881
Good to know.

235
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,951
Gutsy call for a first day.

236
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,991
That's one word for it.

237
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,931
How do you think that's
gonna play down front?

238
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,801
I think Gilman's
gonna shit a brick.

239
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,491
- Hey.
- Door.

240
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,070
How did it go?

241
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,441
Well, Baron wants to sue for...

242
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,341
the sealed docs in
the Geoghan case.

243
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,191
Wants to sue the Church?
Hey, that's great!

244
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,751
We covered Geoghan when
the story broke 3 years ago.

245
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,101
Baron was still in Miami.

246
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,431
Thinking might have been
The Times then actually.

247
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,271
He wasn't here.

248
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,301
So do you think that sue
has a chance?

249
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,881
- Depend on the Judge.
- And what parish he belongs to.

250
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,581
Bradlee. Yeah. Ok.

251
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,921
Baron wants to talk to us.

252
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Us?

253
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,211
Ok Jim, thank you.
Yes. Ok, thanks.

254
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,691
I've set up a meeting for
tomorrow with outside counselor.

255
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,361
- Jon Albano.
- Yeah.

256
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,921
Who's the Judge in this case?

257
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,191
- Constance Sweeney.
- Tough.

258
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,021
- Why is that?
- Good catholic girl.

259
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,551
So...

260
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,051
Judging from what
I've read, it doesn't seem...

261
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,011
like we've done the very thorough
investigation in the Geoghan case?

262
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,411
Is that right?

263
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,011
No. It's not.

264
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,591
We looked hard at Geoghan.

265
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,701
David Armstrong from Metro...

266
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,201
and Michael Polson
through Religion.

267
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,741
Ok, but... Just so
that I understand...

268
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,441
beyond our daily coverage,

269
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,951
we haven't commited any long
term investigative resources...

270
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,741
to the question whether or not
Cardinal Law knew about this.

271
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,471
No, we haven't.

272
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,631
- And that's the kind of
thing your team would do?

273
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,991
- Spotlight? Well yeah,
but we're still prospecting ...

274
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:50,250
the Boston PD story
I told you about.

275
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,961
- Could you set that aside?
- We could.

276
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,061
Marty, in past Spotlight's
had success in large part ...

277
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,291
because they picked
their own projects.

278
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,031
Would you consider
picking this one?

279
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,181
I don't know if he's
writing about you, but...

280
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,311
I will let him know you called.
Ok, bye.

281
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,441
- Hey.
- Hey, how did it go?

282
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,071
Ok. Baron wants us to
scrub the Geoghan case.

283
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,431
- That's great.
- Didn't we cover Geoghan?

284
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,961
There's a lawyer alleging
Cardinal Law knew about it.

285
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,951
Mitch Garabedian, right? - Yeah.
I covered him at the Court House.

286
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,221
Can you get to him?

287
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,741
I only interviewed him once,
he's kind of a character.

288
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,991
I like characters.
I'll take him.

289
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,261
Good, you take him.

290
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,771
Also we should
be talking to...

291
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,941
the lawyer who
repped the victims...

292
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,561
in the Porter case, Eric Macleish.

293
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,561
- That guy who is always on tv.

294
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,227
- The Porter case? Remind me.

295
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,027
- Yeah, Father Porter similar story.

296
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,441
Molested dozens of kids in
Fall River about 10 years ago...

297
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,951
So, we're driving to Boston PD?

298
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:49,901
I vote yes.

299
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,741
No, we should set that
aside for now. Listen.

300
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,091
I don't need to
tell you guys this...

301
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,521
we need to be more
discreet than usual.

302
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,610
Alright?

303
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,501
Everybody's gonna be interested
in this. Not just Herald.

304
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,071
We can't get Cardinal Law get on
this till we know what we have.

305
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,121
Good luck with that.

306
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,331
So when are you leaving?

307
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,581
The bus is picking us up at
Church parking lot at 9 o'clock.

308
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,491
- We got 40 going.
- And is Father Dominic going?

309
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,381
No, he says he's unlucky.

310
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,451
But luck has nothing
to do with it.

311
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,881
You know, last time
nana won $160.

312
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,161
- You gonna tell us?

313
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,961
- We don't even know
if there's a story yet.

314
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,001
Well, club's in Church.
There's gonna be a story.

315
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,551
Hey Lisa, could you pull all the
relative clips on that for me?

316
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Yeah.

317
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,391
This is for Spotlight?

318
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,811
Just drop 'em off when
they're ready, thanks.

319
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,111
Excuse me, do you know where
the publishers office is?

320
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
Will do it.

321
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,521
How are you Marty, settling in?

322
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,741
Yeah, I think so.

323
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,291
Good. What can I do for you?

324
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,751
I'd like to challenge the protective
order in the Geoghan case.

325
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,360
You want to sue the Catholic Church?

326
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,871
We're just filing
the motion, but... Yes.

327
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,601
- You think it's that important?

328
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,101
- Yes, I do.

329
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,401
Because...

330
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,401
Obviously the Church will
fight us very hard on this.

331
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,471
Which won't go unnoticed
by our subscriber base,

332
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,471
53% of them are catholic.

333
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,581
I think they'll be interested.

334
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Ok.

335
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,041
Marty, people will
probably contact you...

336
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,351
about face to face with Cardinal,
it's customary.

337
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,271
Yeah, they already have,
it's set up for next week.

338
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,881
I wouldn't mention this.

339
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,210
Hello?

340
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,750
Hello?

341
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,091
Can I help you?

342
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,371
Hi, I'm Mike Rezendes
from Boston Globe,

343
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,031
I'm here to see Mitchell Garabedian.

344
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,761
- He's on the call, please have a sit.
- Ok.

345
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,321
Alright, I'm listening, go ahead.

346
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,410
Ok.

347
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,961
<i>Bill, where the hell
are those papers?</i>

348
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,121
<i>I asked you to put
them on my desk!</i>

349
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,151
The famous Walter Robinson
in my conference room.

350
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,271
Good to see you again Eric.
Sacha Pfeiffer, Eric Macleish.

351
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,301
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

352
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,411
Youd don't play golf, do you?

353
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,591
- No. - Good. Your colleague
here, took some money of me...

354
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,161
at the charity event last year.

355
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,501
It was a very lucky putt, I...

356
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,511
actually had my eyes closed,
by the way.

357
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,261
So, how can I help you guys?

358
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,061
You are familiar with
the Geoghan case?

359
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,841
Sure, 80 plaintiffs.

360
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,481
All of them individual cases,
Garabedian must be swimming.

361
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,821
Yeah, any allegation
against Cardinal Law?

362
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,891
Yeah, it's tricky.

363
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,731
This is what you need to understand,
these are shitty cases.

364
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,181
Statute of limitation is only
3 years, and most of these...

365
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,781
victims don't come forward
till long after that.

366
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,551
- Why is that?

367
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,551
- Well they're kids, you know?
Guilt, shame...

368
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,661
And most of these kids
come from tough neighbourhood,

369
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,551
nobody wants to admit
this kind of thing, so...

370
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,481
you're screwed on
the time moment, and...

371
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,411
even if you argue your way around that,
the charitable immunity statute...

372
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,471
caps damages at 20 grand.

373
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,861
20 grand, for molesting a child?

374
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,981
That is the way
the system is set up, yes.

375
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,681
The Church is tough, so...

376
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,831
your best shot is to
try this cases in the press.

377
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,251
Like I did on Porter.

378
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,917
But you know, most of the
victims they don't wanna...

379
00:18:32,918 --> 00:18:33,951
have anything do to with TV ...

380
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:39,131
and Mitch isn't exactly
a people person.

381
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,101
Yeah, half Garabedian can kids
victims just go before the press...

382
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,341
that is really...

383
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,071
That's right, and he has
a long road ahead of him.

384
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,711
My guess is, he doesn't
have anything on Law.

385
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,311
- What do you think,
he's bluffing?

386
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,011
- I think he's grandstanding...

387
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,491
to cut a better deal.

388
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,341
- Seems a bit reckless.

389
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,641
- Have you met Mitch Garabedian?

390
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,851
<i>I asked you to
write me that motion Bill,</i>

391
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,861
<i>I didn't ask you to file it.</i>

392
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,191
Hey Bill...

393
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,230
Hi.

394
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,011
- Who are you?
- I'm Mike Rezendes from Boston Globe...

395
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,371
I had an appointment with you,
about an hour ago.

396
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,161
I can't talk to you, I'm busy.
Sharon!

397
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,371
She went for coffee,
she said she'll be right back.

398
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,261
I'm not following up
on an article.

399
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,601
- The one in the Phoenix?
- No, in the Globe.

400
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,951
- Did you see the one in the Phoenix?
- No, I didn't.

401
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,451
I thought it was very good,
I have a copy here somewhere.

402
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,671
It's alright, I'll track it down.

403
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,621
I'm actually
following up on a column...

404
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,991
that Eileen McNamara
wrote about your suit.

405
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,081
Suits, 84 of them.

406
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,681
It's not a class action,
you should get your facts straight.

407
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,710
No, you're right, I should.

408
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,311
So, I'm trying to get
some background information...

409
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,771
You are not
recording this, are you?

410
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,431
No, I wouldn't
do that without asking.

411
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,801
I can't show you
the Church documents...

412
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,571
if that's what you're after.
They're under seal.

413
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Yeah, I know that.

414
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,791
Did you know that
they try to bring me up...

415
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,921
before the Massachusetts
Board of Bar Overseers 3 times?

416
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,291
They are watching me very closely.

417
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,811
- The Church?
- Yeah, the Church. Yeah.

418
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,301
They'd like to get me disbarred,
in fact...Put that away.

419
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,081
- Put it away.
- Sure.

420
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,991
I don't want you recording
this in any way, shape or form.

421
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,061
- Not on paper, not on tape, nothing.
- Ok.

422
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,861
In fact, I probably
shouldn't even be speaking to you.

423
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:36,691
So...

424
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,751
Look, Mr. Garabedian,
I know there's...

425
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,701
things, you cannot tell me, but...

426
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,935
I also know there's a story here..

427
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,475
and I think it's an important story.

428
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,621
- I already talked to the Phoenix.
- Yeah, there's a reason I didn't see it.

429
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,211
Nobody reads a Phoenix anymore...

430
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,211
they're broke,
they don't have any power.

431
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,461
The Globe does.

432
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,731
If we cover the story,
everybody will hear about it.

433
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,921
The Church thinks
in centuries, Mr. Rezendes.

434
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,281
Do you think your paper
has resources to take that on?

435
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,401
Yeah, I do.

436
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,681
But if you don't
mind me asking... Do you?

437
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,161
I can't talk to you right now,
Mr. Rezendes. I'm very, very busy.

438
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,812
- Sharon.
- Thank you.

439
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,819
Yeah, yeah.

440
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,711
Can I at least talk to
some of the clients?

441
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,590
Victims? I'd really like to do that.

442
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,141
- call me tomorrow, I got to think about it.
- Thank you.

443
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,421
Yeah, yeah.

444
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,411
<i>A FAMILIAR PATTERN</i>

445
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,950
<i>Porter faces Mass. court
as '87 abuse claim arises</i>

446
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,261
- I got more clips from the library.
- Leave 'em right there.

447
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,601
Are you guys doing
a story on the Church?

448
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,771
No, we are not doing
a story on the Church.

449
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,411
Matt. You find anything
on this guy Phil Saviano?

450
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,061
No. Who is he?

451
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,941
He's part of a victims organization.

452
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,741
Kurkjian did a story on him
right after the Porter case.

453
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,601
As of victims organization?

454
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,581
Yeah. It's called SNAP.

455
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,951
It's Survivors Network
of those Abused by Priest.

456
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,301
Chrommy acronym.

457
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,561
- Want me to track him down?
- Yeah, bring him in.

458
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,300
How much longer do you need
to get through the clips?

459
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,861
I mean, a few days,
there's a lot.

460
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,431
- Lisa is still sending it more.
- Ok.

461
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,211
Hey guys, I think I got
another Priest.

462
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,531
Liam Barrett. Molested
some kids in Philly,

463
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,891
and was moved to Boston, did
the same thing and was moved again.

464
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,351
Really?
That sounds like Geoghan.

465
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,711
Is that one of our clips?

466
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,171
Yeah, by our Lance Diego written
in 1987, must have been back...

467
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,910
when he worked on religion.

468
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,821
- Was there any follow?
- Not much, only show one piece.

469
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,631
The Church settled the case.

470
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,201
- Don't you know Jim Sullivan?

471
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,201
- Yeah. Why?

472
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,601
Looks like the Church
bought him an ....

473
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,201
Jesus. Should be Manning
on the ball in field.

474
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,061
- Why do you even
bother with that thing?

475
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,261
- It distracts me from the game.

476
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,421
You know what else
is good for that?

477
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,691
Oh, yeah. Good idea, buy a round.
I'll be right back.

478
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,161
- Anybody want any food?
- A hotdog.

479
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,021
- So you guys making any progress?
- Absolutely, it's a good story.

480
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,161
Why? Because you're another left
catholic pissed off at the Church?

481
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,971
- We got a lot of good stuff.
- Like what?

482
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,892
I'm just watching the game. Omerta.

483
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,461
- They got another priest, Liam Barrett.
- We reported it.

484
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,551
I'm just saying, we did.

485
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,171
Ok, but this guy
was shuffled a lot...

486
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,761
from parish to parish
every few years ...

487
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,211
just like Geoghan and Porter.
I think there's a pattern.

488
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,711
Sounds thin.
What else you got?

489
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,981
Sacha's got another guy from
a victims organization. Phil Saviano.

490
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,121
- From SNAP?
O boy, we reported on him too.

491
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,620
I thought you were
watching a game, Steve.

492
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,631
- That guy is pretty paint up, Mike.
- We did a couple stories on him.

493
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,641
- Guy would not stop writing letters.

494
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,781
- He wants a holy war.

495
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,391
- So, he's not worth talking to?
- Where are you on Garabedian?

496
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,261
I'm working on it.

497
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,491
Robby say Macleish
thinks he's bluffing.

498
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,211
- I think there's
something there Ben.

499
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,211
- Get me something solid
or I'm taking you off him.

500
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,351
I don't want us chasing
our tails on this.

501
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,001
Stay away from that trap.

502
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,201
You couldn't reach that trap
in a million years partner.

503
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,501
- I could reach that trap before.
- Yeah, now Paul.

504
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,071
- How we doin'?
- Good.

505
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,941
We're two up in the front.

506
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,401
- How's that new editor working out?
- Well, he doesn't like baseball.

507
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,081
But, he seems like a smart guy.

508
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,961
Yeah, I read an article
about him, said he's a...

509
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,280
first jewish
editor of The Globe.

510
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,711
Must be the slow news day.

511
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:41,921
- He got a family, this guy?
- No, he is not married.

512
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,791
- Divorced?
- I don't think so, no.

513
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,371
So, the new editor of
The Globe is not married man...

514
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,441
of the jewish fate
who hates baseball.

515
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,241
- Yeah.
- So you give him to Ben.

516
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,201
It's Brad for crying out loud.

517
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,811
Didn't raise his hand
fast enough I guess.

518
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,961
Hey by the way, I've been
reading about this priest...

519
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,271
Father Barrett, said you
were involved with that?

520
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,811
Barrett yeah, bad egg.

521
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,731
Leaks that extra help we pitched in.

522
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,741
Victims said
Cardinal Law knew about...

523
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,351
Barrett, when he came
to Philly. Is that true?

524
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,131
You know I can't talk
about the case Robby.

525
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,771
Off the record?

526
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,631
Off the record,
I can't talk about it.

527
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,911
- This related to a lawsuit?
- You know about that?

528
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,451
Look.

529
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,640
I don't know this guy Baron...

530
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,831
or what his agenda is,
frankly I don't care.

531
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,001
I just don't wanna see
you taking bullet for.

532
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,331
I think you're away.

533
00:26:46,092 --> 00:26:47,684
- Right over here.
- Lets go, lets go.

534
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,881
<i>So the other day I was
on the world wide web.</i>

535
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,841
<i>Anything you wanna know,
it's right there.</i>

536
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,251
Now, I have to admit
that as a priest,

537
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,131
this makes me
a little nervous.

538
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,451
Should I be worried about
job security?

539
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,451
I don't think so.

540
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:13,461
<i>You see... Knowledge is one thing,
... but fate. Fate is another.</i>

541
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,361
- Hey.
- Hey.

542
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,671
- So should we golfing or something?
- "Golfing" is not a verb.

543
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,401
And I couldn't get a tee time.

544
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,131
Is that what they
call it, tee time?

545
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,741
They also call it
a leasure activity.

546
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,111
You oughta try it Mike.

547
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,201
- I do, I run.
- Yeah, you run to work.

548
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,781
So why are you here today?

549
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,321
Going over this clips of Saviano.

550
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,621
Yeah, Ben and Steve
thinks it's a dead end.

551
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,691
They gave me a bunch of
crap about it at the game.

552
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,321
- Yeah, Ben emailed me.
- He did?

553
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,521
- Yeah... He said we
should let it go.

554
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,321
- What do you wanna do?

555
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,451
- We bring Saviano in.

556
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,951
- So, just ignore those guys?

557
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:20,341
I think we got to start
ignoring everybody on this one.

558
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,481
I'm good at that.

559
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:24,060
Huh.

560
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,001
You think Marty has any idea
what's coming down to plank?

561
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,721
No, I don't think
he cares either.

562
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,511
That's refreshing.

563
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,250
Yeah.

564
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,751
Unless he's wrong.

565
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,881
<i>I have always been fascinated
with the newspaper business.</i>

566
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,261
I used to sit in on
the lectures with...

567
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,151
the Nieman fellows,
when I was at Harvard.

568
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,481
I, I read that you
were an editor once.

569
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,201
Yes. That was
a very long time ago.

570
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:19,341
The Mississippi Register. Small.

571
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,701
Diocese in newspaper.

572
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,991
But for 30 year old Pastor
it was a big responsibility.

573
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,571
Too much of times.

574
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,900
How so?

575
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,991
I was close with
the Everist brothers,

576
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,921
we took a stand on civil rights.

577
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,301
Our readership was not pleased.

578
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,451
They saw me as meddling outsider.

579
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,111
I can imagine.

580
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,461
Tough sit to sit in,
especially in a small town.

581
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,141
I think you'll find that Boston's...

582
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,851
still a small town too, Marty.

583
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,391
In any ways.

584
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,731
But if I can be of any help, Marty,
don't hesitate to ask.

585
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,401
I find that the city
flourishes...

586
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,591
when its grand
institution works together.

587
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,741
Thank you. Personally,
I'm of the opinion...

588
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,291
that for the paper to
best perform its function...

589
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,301
it really needs to stand alone.

590
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:26,411
of course. But my
offer still stands.

591
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,440
Thank you.

592
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,620
Come in.

593
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,431
Thank you, Maureen.

594
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,401
Little gift, Marty.

595
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:45,011
Think of it as a Cardinals
guide to the city of Boston.

596
00:30:51,345 --> 00:30:53,895
<i>CATHOLIC CHURCH
CATECHISM</i>

597
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,241
- I'm here to see Sacha Pfeiffer.
- Your name?

598
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,931
- Phil Saviano.
- Ok, just a minute.

599
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,991
So, am I first
survivor you talk to?

600
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,981
- Yeah, sure you are.
- Ok, well...

601
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,201
First of all, let me say thank
you for having me in today.

602
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,451
And I want you to know
that you'll have...

603
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:23,871
the full cooperation of
my organization, SNAP.

604
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,831
How many members are in
your organization Phil?

605
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,051
We had 11, at our
last chapter meating...

606
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,601
No 10, Karen just moved.

607
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,561
You had a woman
in your group?

608
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,951
Of course there was a woman,

609
00:31:34,965 --> 00:31:36,551
they don't discriminate,
not when it comes to abuse.

610
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,461
And this has nothing
to do with being gay.

611
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,201
What this is, is priest
using the collar to rape kids.

612
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,181
Kids, boys and girls.

613
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:50,246
<i>PHIL SAVIANO
AGE 11</i>

614
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,031
I was 11.

615
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,031
And I was preyed upon
by Father David Holly.

616
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,060
In Wester.

617
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,091
And I don't mean prayed for,
I mean preyed upon.

618
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,591
Are any of you catholic?

619
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,731
I was raised catholic,

620
00:32:04,734 --> 00:32:06,711
now I go to my wife's
Presbyterian Church.

621
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,171
I'm lapsed, I go to Church
of my grandmother sometimes.

622
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,071
It's safe to say we were
all raised catholic, but now...

623
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,201
Not so much.

624
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,001
Ok, well let me tell you...

625
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,391
When you are poor
kid from a poor family,

626
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,661
religion counts for a lot.

627
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,761
And when a priest pays attention
to you, it's a big deal.

628
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,951
He ask you to collect a hymnals,

629
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,001
or take out a trash,
you feel special.

630
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,451
It's like God asking for help.

631
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,065
Maybe it's a little weird when
he tells you a dirty joke...

632
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,771
but now you got
a secret together.

633
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,431
So you go along.

634
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,071
Then he shows you a porno mag.

635
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,601
And then you go along,
and you go along...

636
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,931
And you go along.

637
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,251
Until one day he asks you to
jerk him off or give him a blowjob.

638
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,261
And so you go
along with that too.

639
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,761
Because you feel trapped,
because he has groomed you.

640
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,640
How do you say no
to a God, right?

641
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,641
See...

642
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,190
It is important to
understand that this is not...

643
00:33:02,195 --> 00:33:04,681
just physical abuse,
it's spirital abuse too.

644
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,781
Then when a priest
does this to you,

645
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,781
he robs you of your faith.

646
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,331
So you reach for the bottle,
or the needle.

647
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,291
Or if those don't work
you jump of a bridge.

648
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,411
That's why we call
ourselves survivors.

649
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,011
Have you read Jason Barry's book,

650
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,231
he wrote about
a Gauthe case in Louisiana.

651
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,761
- That's G...
- G-a-u-t-h-e.

652
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,651
I talked to Richard Sipe,
he worked in one of...

653
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,280
the Church's treatment center.

654
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,461
He is an ex-priest.
Married a nun.

655
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,691
Yeah. This is his testimony
from the Cass case.

656
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,611
Phil, what's a treatment center?

657
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,481
It's where they send priests
when they get caught...

658
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,741
this is all right
here in the box.

659
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,801
I sent this all to
you guys 5 years ago.

660
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,141
To The Globe?
Who did you send it to?

661
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,311
I don't wanna say who,

662
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,951
but they said that
they weren't interested.

663
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,001
- But Phil... We did run a couple
stories on you, I saw them in the clips...

664
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,131
Yeah, but to be completely
frank it wasn't enough.

665
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,111
You guys gotta understand.

666
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,111
This is big.

667
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,661
This is not just Boston, this is
a whole country, it's a whole world.

668
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,961
And it goes right
up to the Vatican.

669
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,581
- Do you have any proof ot that, Phil?
- No, not yet.

670
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,321
But think about it,
there are so many of them.

671
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,331
How else could they if never saw one.

672
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,981
- So many what?
- Priests!

673
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:22,671
Priests! I know 13
right here in Boston.

674
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:26,261
You know 13 priest in Boston
who have molested children?

675
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,601
Yeah, why do you keep
repeating everything I say?

676
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,151
- I just like to clarify things.

677
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,151
- Maybe you should've
clarified it 5 years ago...

678
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,101
when I sent you
all of this stuff,

679
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,101
it's all right here.

680
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,091
- May I use your bathroom?
- Yeah, sure Phil.

681
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,391
Come on.

682
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,551
Well... What do you think?

683
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,201
- The guy's got an agenda, that's for sure.
- You think?

684
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,261
He's obviously been through
a lot, but he's smart and...

685
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,651
it's right about 13 priests.

686
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,641
Yeah, and might be
a big if with this guy.

687
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,131
Do a background check on him.

688
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,331
And follow up some of
the other survivors of this group.

689
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,161
I'll track on this
ex-priests and Sipe.

690
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,041
Ok, but stay on Garabedian,
that's more important.

691
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,391
Garabedian, what
a pain in the ass.

692
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,580
You can be a pain
in the ass, Mike.

693
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,701
Mitchell, what a surprise.
How are you?

694
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,151
- I'm fine Mr. Rezendes.

695
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,051
- Good, you know, I've never
heard back from you...

696
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,211
I left you a couple of messages.

697
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,451
I know. I've been very busy,
I don't have time for calls.

698
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,331
Geez, I'm sure you don't.
Listen, listen Mitch.

699
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,381
Let me talk to
the couple of victims.

700
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,081
You consider on an interview...

701
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,590
and if you're not happy,
you can kill it.

702
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,779
I spoke to my clients and they
don't want to be in the press.

703
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:53,580
I'm sorry.

704
00:35:53,614 --> 00:35:55,671
I get that, but I don't
need to name their names.

705
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,301
- I don't believe you Mr. Rezendes.
- I'm sure you don't.

706
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,131
- Listen Mitchell.
- Mr. Rezendes, please...

707
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,181
I'm not writing a profile here,
I'm working on something bigger.

708
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,891
Bigger? I don't know
what that means.

709
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,851
I'm not supposed to tell you this
but I'm digging a run for Spotlight.

710
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,061
Spotlight is on this?

711
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,001
Yeah, we're looking into it
but you gotta help me.

712
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,320
You gotta let me talk
to some of these victims, please.

713
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,670
Please.

714
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,471
- Come back tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.
- Thank you.

715
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,361
- Ms. Pfeiffer.
- Joe.

716
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,151
Hi.

717
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,561
- Shit.
- That's ok.

718
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,940
- I'm sorry. Please sit.
- No problem. Thank you.

719
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:51,011
- Is this table ok?
- This is perfect.

720
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,611
I had a muffin while I was
waiting, two actually.

721
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,751
I eat when I'm nervous.

722
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,091
I did that too actually.

723
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:03,521
I hope I'm not late.
Phil told me 1 o'clock.

724
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:07,231
No, you're fine. I got
here early. About na hour.

725
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,321
Would you mind if I took some notes?
Would that be alright?

726
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,941
You don't mind if I take
some notes, do you?

727
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,491
You got to use my name?

728
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,520
No.

729
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,881
I'm not if you don't
want me to, no.

730
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,711
I just had a kid, he's only 1...

731
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,951
but I'm not sure I want
him to know about this.

732
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,551
Sure, I get that.

733
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,761
You can stop this
interview at any time Patrick.

734
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,271
- Alright?
- Ok.

735
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,371
Alright.

736
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,871
- You got it with your notes...
- Ok, so...

737
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,321
Where'd you live
when it first happen?

738
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,691
In the Projects,
over in Hyde Park.

739
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,131
- Over by the Stop & Shop?
- Yeah, you know it?

740
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,451
Yeah, I drove a cab for a few years?
Opened really bad coffee, right?

741
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,661
Yeah, I guess.

742
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,221
How old were you,
when it happened?

743
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,021
I was 12.

744
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,021
Just after my dad killed himself.

745
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,721
- Oh, geez.
- He was a real piece of shit.

746
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,761
And my mom she wasn't
so stable either.

747
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,020
- How do you mean?
- I mean she was nuts.

748
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,371
- She was schizophrenic.
- Same shit.

749
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:30,571
When did you first meet Geoghan?

750
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,081
Well, my sister... she saw him
over at the Dunkin' Donuts...

751
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,721
tells him about my old man
passing and he rushed right over.

752
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,331
And there was this nun sister
Barbara, and she ran this group...

753
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,870
for kids from troubled families.

754
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,141
- Where is that?
- San Ambrose in Dorchester.

755
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,441
Ok.

756
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,531
She's the one who
introduced me to Father Shanley.

757
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:56,411
He was a street priest,
long hair, very hip.

758
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,901
- He invited me to his inhabit in Back Bay.
- Where in Back Bay?

759
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,091
- Beacon street.
- Beacon, ok.

760
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,541
Are you from here?

761
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,051
No, I grew up in Ohio
but my mom is from Southie.

762
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,161
I see you got it. I've
never even seen Back Bay.

763
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,701
So, what happened on
that first visit Joe?

764
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,451
Well it was very nice at first.
Very funny. Very casual.

765
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,741
And I think he
could tell I was gay.

766
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,321
So he showed me
this mobile he had,

767
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,621
thing over the babies crib.

768
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,481
But with different words,

769
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,481
homosexual, transexual, bisexual.

770
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,751
Ok. And did you know that you
were gay at that time, Joe?

771
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,671
Yes, but that wasn't information
I'm sharing with anybody.

772
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,961
Not in Dorchester.

773
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,661
Ok.

774
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:50,061
So, what happened after
he showed you the mobile?

775
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,551
Well, I was a little freaked out.

776
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,471
I think he could tell...

777
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,971
So he said, you
know what'll help...

778
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,021
is if we play strip poker.

779
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,471
Of course I lost.

780
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,831
And thing went on from there.

781
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,381
Can you tell me
specifically what happened?

782
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,471
Specifically... He molested me.

783
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,071
Joe, I think that the language
is going to be so important here.

784
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,851
We can't sanitize this, just
saying 'molest' isn't enough.

785
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,781
People need to know
what actually happened.

786
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,421
- We should probably get these to go.
- Right.

787
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:37,061
Geoghan shows up and my mom,
you know she's...

788
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,111
She's thrilled. And...

789
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,051
this was like God
showing up, you know?

790
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
Sure, right.

791
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,721
So what happened then?

792
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,091
You really wanna hear this shit?

793
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,411
Yeah, yeah Patrick, I do.

794
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,961
He offers to take me
to get icecream.

795
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,101
- He's a priest.
I'm a kid so I go.

796
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,861
- Sure.

797
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,961
So we're driving home, and he...

798
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,281
He starts petting my leg.

799
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,741
You know and then...

800
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,031
His hand just...
slides right up and...

801
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,801
he grabs my dick, alright?

802
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,511
I just froze up,
I was fuckin' petrified...

803
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,781
I couldn't move.

804
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,041
I didn't know what to do,
I was just a little kid.

805
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,581
Yeah.

806
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,291
You know I never even
touched my icecream.

807
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,601
Just melted down my arm.

808
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,051
Did you...hm?

809
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,601
Did you see him
again after that?

810
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,051
Yeah.

811
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:12,221
Alright, that's good,
let's stop there for now.

812
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,250
Sure.

813
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,781
He said he was a way to make me
more comfortable with my body.

814
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,991
So, what happened after that?

815
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:23,781
He took off his clothes and
he said I've been so depressed,

816
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,081
but maybe you can cheer me up
and give a blowjob.

817
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,331
classic guy!

818
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,031
- And did you?
- Yeah.

819
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,941
I know what you
must be thinking, like...

820
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,330
why would I ever do that?

821
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,291
To some creepy guy who's
30 years older than me, but...

822
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,711
but we have to understand is that
this is the first time in my life,

823
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,971
that someone told me
that it was ok to be gay.

824
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,761
And it was a priest.

825
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,291
So you had oral sex?

826
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,251
Did you have intercourse?

827
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,051
Yes, not then, but later.

828
00:42:58,570 --> 00:42:59,931
It really messed me up.

829
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,341
I'm sober now, but that,
that was the beginning of it all .

830
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,681
It's very confusing, you know?

831
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,091
To be introduced to
sex like that and then,

832
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,001
and then to be attracted to men.

833
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,081
I'm sorry. I knew I was
gonna do this. Oh I'm sorry.

834
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:24,501
Don't be sorry.
It's ok Joe, it's ok.

835
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,000
Of course, there is
a Church right there.

836
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,490
And a playground.

837
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,991
Joe, did you ever
try and tell anyone?

838
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,681
Like who, a priest?

839
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,251
- Can I use your phone?

840
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,251
- Yeah, sure, you
know where it is.

841
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,521
You can use my name if you want.

842
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,271
Thanks, Patrick.

843
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,831
Don't thank me, just get
this assholes, will ya?

844
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,761
He's one of the lucky ones.

845
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,601
He is still alive.

846
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,391
- Do you want a cup of tea, Sacha?
- I'm ok nana. Thanks.

847
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,961
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, Joe, it's Sacha Pfeiffer.

848
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,291
<i>- Hi Sacha, how are you?</i>
- I'm good, thanks.

849
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,031
Listen, Joe, I just want
a follow up on one thing.

850
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,991
You talked to Phil Saviano
about all of this, right?

851
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,401
<i>Yeah, I did, I went to
a couple of SNAP meetings.</i>

852
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,631
And did Phil ever suggest
you to do anything about it?

853
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:33,161
<i>No, the meetings weren't
really about that.</i>

854
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:35,591
<i>We meet a couple of them
canonical lawyers, but</i>

855
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,121
<i>- I didn't think it was worth it.</i>
- Why not?

856
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,411
<i>There were just so many forms to
fill out, it was overwhelming, you know.</i>

857
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:44,401
<i>And he said he could only
get me a small settlement, so...</i>

858
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,861
- Who said that?
<i>- The lawyer told me that.</i>

859
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,251
So, you did go
and see a lawyer?

860
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,641
<i>Yeah, but I didn't
end up using him, so...</i>

861
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,911
<i>I didn't think
it was important, I'm sorry.</i>

862
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,671
<i>- I'm not trying to hide anything.</i>
- No, I know, Joe.

863
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,271
Do you remember his name?
The lawyer?

864
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,171
<i>No, but maybe
Phil would know?</i>

865
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,861
<i>The guy was on TV a lot
during the Porter case.</i>

866
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,211
<i>He was handsome.</i>

867
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,221
- Was it Eric Macleish?
<i>- Yeah, that's him. Macleish.</i>

868
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,251
<i>I thought he was
very handsome.</i>

869
00:45:17,977 --> 00:45:19,462
- Hey.
- Hey.

870
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,771
I was just in a newsroom...

871
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:22,910
Jugde Sweeney set
a date for the hearing.

872
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,981
- Really, when?
- In two weeks, in Springfield.

873
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,831
Canellos started a pool
of 10 bucks to get in.

874
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,361
Anyone picking The Globe?

875
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:33,661
He's only taking best if how
fast Sweeney rules against us.

876
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,091
- Robby.
<i>- Hi, it's me.</i>

877
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,611
<i>- Did you got my message?</i>
- I did.

878
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,701
Looks like Father Shanley
could be our fourth priest.

879
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:42,151
<i>- Yeah, I think he is.</i>

880
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,151
- Did you follow up on Macleish?

881
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,021
<i>I just talked with Phil,
he said Macleish...</i>

882
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,551
<i>dealt with a number
of this cases.</i>

883
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,951
<i>- I guess he forgot to mention that.</i>
- Yeah.

884
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,161
I'm gonna go to the courthouse
tomorrow, see if I can ...

885
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,201
find any cases he settled
against the Church.

886
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,341
<i>Alright, call me
after yo do.</i>

887
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,391
<i>- Good night.</i>
- Ok, good night.

888
00:46:01,495 --> 00:46:02,495
Hey.

889
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,491
You on to a Jack?

890
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,431
Yeah, I'm late for dinner,
you wanna walk me out?

891
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:07,490
Sure.

892
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:11,181
- Jesus, does this
guy ever go home?

893
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,081
- Apparently not.

894
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,351
I got guys pull in till he does,

895
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,151
he's wearing over
the goddamn newsroom.

896
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,081
- Where are we on Geoghan?

897
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,081
- Yeah following up
on more victims.

898
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,361
- Hey I want to expend
the investigation. - Why?

899
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,331
We got fourth priest,
it might be as many as 13.

900
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,971
- 13?
- Yeah.

901
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,021
- Who's your source?
- Phil Saviano.

902
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,241
Oh, Jesus Christ Robby,
I told Mike...

903
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:33,801
I know, I know.

904
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,171
I know, I think Saviano
might be legit, Ben.

905
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:38,961
- You want to elaborate on that?

906
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:40,961
- No, not really.

907
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,001
It just feels like this thing
is stacking up. He's my guy.

908
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,141
- Ok.
- Ok, good, thank you.

909
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,210
Hello?

910
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:05,491
<i>- Mr. Rezendes?</i>
- Yeah, who is this?

911
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,131
<i>It's Richard Sipe.</i>

912
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,506
Oh, yeah, hey Richard,
how are you?

913
00:47:09,568 --> 00:47:10,568
<i>I'm good.</i>

914
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,911
Thanks for calling.

915
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:14,711
Look... Phil Saviano
gave me your name,

916
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:17,191
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions?

917
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:18,661
<i>- Of course, yeah.</i>
- Great.

918
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:22,281
So, Phil told me that you
were working at one of...

919
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,470
the Church's treatment
centers in Baltimore?

920
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,651
<i>Yes, the Seton
Psychiatric Institute.</i>

921
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,471
<i>It was run by
the Daughters of Charity.</i>

922
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,541
And ...?

923
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:32,391
When was that, Richard?

924
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:37,051
<i>Well, I started my psychotherapy
fellowship there in 1965.</i>

925
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,761
<i>And I was there for 5 years,
then I spend the next 30...</i>

926
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,641
<i>studying abusive priests
and their victims.</i>

927
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:44,670
Really?

928
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,141
And that's been your sole focus?

929
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:50,461
<i>Look Mike, the Church
wants us to believe that...</i>

930
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,281
<i>it's just a few bad apples.</i>

931
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,061
<i>It's much bigger
problem than that.</i>

932
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:55,421
- How much bigger, Richard?

933
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:57,621
<i>- Well, based on the research...</i>

934
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,431
<i>I would classify it as
a recognizable psychiatric phenomenon.</i>

935
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,651
That's big?

936
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,781
- Hey, Mag.
- Hey.

937
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,051
If I wanted historical
data on a priest,...

938
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,761
parishes, sit he'd been asigned to,
where would I find it?

939
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,721
The Geoghan case? It's all in clips.
Lis has this classed material.

940
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,481
Yeah, what if it was for another priest,
the one that hadn't been in the papers.

941
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:23,911
- Looking at another priest?
- Who're you looking at?

942
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,651
Any ideas?

943
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,931
Come on, Matt.
You're not gonna tell me?

944
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:30,461
I got to get to
a meeting, thanks Mag.

945
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:31,550
Hey, D.

946
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,491
The Archdioceses puts
out the annual directory.

947
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:36,941
Every priest in parish.

948
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,801
That's great. This go back
any further than '98?

949
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,611
Oh yeah, going back to
the '80 in the mass.

950
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,040
The all night you
got to go to the BPL.

951
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,781
- The mass, ah? Thanks, Lisa.
- Bye.

952
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,210
He said the all target
is the same kind of kid.

953
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,141
Low income families,
absentee fathers,...

954
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:54,170
broken homes.

955
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,791
For guy like Geoghan, goes after
boys, not because he prefers them...

956
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:00,521
but because they are more
ashamed,less likely to talk.

957
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:03,751
And these guys are
predators, Robby.

958
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,201
I talked to Sipe.

959
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,691
Said he's seen dozens
of them in '60 in Seton.

960
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:09,591
He called it a "phenomenon".

961
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,541
- Why didn't he go public?
- He did.

962
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,771
But the Church made a huge
effort to discredit him.

963
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,921
Smear campaigns. Public statements
by prominent Bishops.

964
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,421
It's just like Saviano said.
And Garabedian.

965
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,001
- You get anywhere with him?
- More victims.

966
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,661
More victims?

967
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,081
You can't empty his files.

968
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,460
I'll get to him,
I just need more time.

969
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,741
- Come on Mike, you got to get them.
- I'll get them, I'll get them.

970
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:35,701
Jesus, what the hell is that smell?

971
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:37,571
There's a dead rat in the corner.

972
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,581
What have you got?

973
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,561
Church directories.

974
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,251
It's every priest in Massachusetts.

975
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,781
- What parish they were assaigned to?
- Is it official?

976
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,231
Yeah, I figure it would
help us track down some...

977
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:48,011
of the priests
that Saviano mentioned.

978
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:49,470
Maybe find some more victims.

979
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,840
Can we turn on some
more light in here?

980
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,781
I couldn't find the switch.
Do you want to borrow my glasses?

981
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:55,431
- No, I'm good, I'm good.
- Look, look 1983.

982
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,031
John Geoghan,
Saint Brendan Parish Dorchester.

983
00:49:58,590 --> 00:49:59,741
So, so we can find out...

984
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,241
where any priest is
at any given year?

985
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,551
Yeah, I got him here.

986
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,111
What?

987
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:08,451
1980, the year Geoghan
was pulled from JP.

988
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:09,801
Said he's on sick leave.

989
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,421
Come on, it really says that?

990
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,641
Where is, 1991?

991
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:18,571
- Yeah, here.
- Let's see this.

992
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,961
Barry Liam, I can't read this,
look for Liam Barry there.

993
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,501
1991 is the year they pulled
him of the Charleston abbey.

994
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,650
Burt Liam?

995
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,820
Yeah.

996
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:32,090
Sick leave.

997
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,501
That's an official designation.

998
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,881
Get this upstairs.

999
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,601
And match...Check on those

1000
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,321
priests Saviano gave us.
Robby.

1001
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,191
<i>- I'm at the Court House.</i>
- Yeah.

1002
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,091
Something's not right here.

1003
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,951
Nothing on Shanley either, Sacha.

1004
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,121
Ok, thanks.

1005
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,601
Yeah, we need to go
talk to Macleish again.

1006
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,630
<i>Really? Why?</i>

1007
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,251
There's nothing here.

1008
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:55,250
There aren't any records...

1009
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,941
Thanks for waiting, so sorry guys.
Stuck in a call.

1010
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,651
- Not a problem, how are you?
- Good.

1011
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:07,210
- Thanks for meeting us.
- You bet. What's up guys?

1012
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:10,621
Mr. Macleish, are you familiar
with the priest named Paul Shinley?

1013
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:12,651
Yes, I am familiar with him.

1014
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,751
And have you settled
cases against Father Shinley?

1015
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,811
As I'm sure you can
understand, I can't...

1016
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,451
discuss that with you.

1017
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:26,471
Yeah, how about
Father Ronald Paquin?

1018
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:29,551
Well, I can't discuss that
with you either, c'mon guys.

1019
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,351
We understand you've settled
several cases against each of them.

1020
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:37,311
Even if I've been
involved in those cases...

1021
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,451
the settlements
would be confidential.

1022
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:42,131
And I can be disbarred for
acknowledging their existence.

1023
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,960
Ok?

1024
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,091
Look, I told you guys,
these are tough cases.

1025
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:51,781
Most of these folks, they
just want some acknowledgement...

1026
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:53,621
of what happened.

1027
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:55,541
We got them a sit down
with the Bishop and...

1028
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,951
a little dough, and that's
the best they can hope for.

1029
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,461
Well, certainly, the best
that priest could hope for.

1030
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,691
No, the Church promises to take...

1031
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,290
the priest out of circulation.

1032
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,381
And did you follow up on that?

1033
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:16,631
- You guys need anything else?
- Yes.

1034
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,521
Why aren't there any records?

1035
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,211
I was down at
the Court House earlier...

1036
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,531
there aren't any records
of any of these settlements.

1037
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,591
We dealt directly
with the Church.

1038
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:32,271
We withdraw all but the man letter
and send it to the Chancery.

1039
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,271
You never filed anything in Court?

1040
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,411
- It's a private mediation.
- So...

1041
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,511
this is just you and
the Archdiocese lawyers...

1042
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,411
- in a room.
- Correct.

1043
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,320
Anyone else?

1044
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:51,041
Occasionally the Church would bring in
another defence attorney to help out.

1045
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:54,311
- You know names?
- No.

1046
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,451
No I don't.

1047
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,941
So this was all under the table.

1048
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:00,530
There's no paper trail, at all.

1049
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,351
The victim has to sign
the confidentiality...

1050
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:04,101
agreement to get the settlement.

1051
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,931
The lawyer takes the third and...

1052
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,171
the Church sweeps it under the rug.

1053
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,301
- Jesus, that's freaking racket.

1054
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:09,821
- It's more complicated than that.

1055
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:11,801
Macleish has got
the duty to client...

1056
00:53:11,809 --> 00:53:12,971
to get the best deal he can.

1057
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,871
Sure, but how many victims...

1058
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,451
do you represent and profit from,
before you say someting?

1059
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,931
Garabedian would say none.

1060
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,711
And that's why he's taking
these cases to Court.

1061
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,301
Because he wants
people to know about this.

1062
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:24,330
I agree.

1063
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:26,581
And legal acts is aside,
Ben, I mean...

1064
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,321
operating the way Macleish has,

1065
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,581
all the guarantee is that
abuse stays under wraps.

1066
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:34,861
Yeah, did Macleish confirm
all Saviano's priests?

1067
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,291
No, he is...

1068
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,381
limited by his
confidentiality agreement.

1069
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:42,081
But clearly he settles cases
against a number of them.

1070
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,700
Phil's put me in touch with
some of the other victims,

1071
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,151
I'm pretty confident all of his
priests are going to check out.

1072
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:50,341
- So there's 13 priests?
- Yeah.

1073
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,551
Looks that way.

1074
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,401
Holy shit!

1075
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,121
Ok, keep going.

1076
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:02,311
<i>CATHOLIC CHARITIES GALA
Guest List</i>

1077
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,811
I'm sorry, what was
the name again?

1078
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:07,091
Baron.

1079
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,811
B-A-R-O-N.

1080
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,801
I'm having trouble finding it,
just give me a second.

1081
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,911
It's ok Kim, I can vouch for him.

1082
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,941
I'm Pete Conley, I'm on
the Board of Catholic Charities.

1083
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,091
Welcome to Boston, Mr. Baron.

1084
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,291
- Thank you.
- Appreciate you joining us.

1085
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,641
We're very proud of the work
we do here at Boston.

1086
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,601
Oh, the Cardinal said
you had a nice visit.

1087
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:33,671
- Yes. We did.
- He's an extraordinary man.

1088
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,121
I'm glad you had
a chance to chat.

1089
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,291
Enjoying yourself?

1090
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,521
To be honest, these events
aren't really my strong suit.

1091
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,421
- Yeah.
- Are you involved with The Charity?

1092
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,341
Not directly, no.

1093
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:02,841
Some of my friends are,
we all went to...

1094
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,451
highschool, BC High, that's a...

1095
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,781
school across the street
from The Globe.

1096
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,501
- It's hard to miss.
- Yeah.

1097
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,171
Hard to get away
from too apparently.

1098
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:19,501
The Cardinal is in the corner,
if you're so inclined.

1099
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,331
- We've met.
- Really?

1100
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,371
Did he mentioned the suit?

1101
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,531
No, but he did give
me a copy of cathecism.

1102
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,291
Yeah, well, the Cardinal is
not known for his subtlety.

1103
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,051
During the Porter investigation,
he'd literally...

1104
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,391
call down the power
of God on the Globe.

1105
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:37,421
How that got out?

1106
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,461
Week later, I got
broke leg skiing.

1107
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,631
Shrimp toast, gentlemen?

1108
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,991
No, thanks. Thanks.

1109
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,251
He said one of
the victims father...

1110
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,560
a criminal complaint?

1111
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,621
Yeah, there were a few of them.

1112
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,761
But the Judge had
the case reconciled...

1113
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:59,190
after friends of
the Church complained.

1114
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,991
And the Church has
a lot of friends.

1115
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,241
Like Eric Macleish?

1116
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,471
Yeah. Let's just say...

1117
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,411
he is not part of the solution.

1118
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,431
- You follow what I'm saying.
- Sure.

1119
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:12,531
You work hard Mr. Rezendes.

1120
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,721
Are you married?

1121
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,851
Yeah.

1122
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:17,411
And your wife doesn't mind
you working all the time?

1123
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,781
Yeah, she does.

1124
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:22,370
That's why I never got married.

1125
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:24,301
To busy.

1126
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,421
What I do is to important.

1127
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,531
Your new editor,
he's a jew, right?

1128
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,901
- That's right, yeah.
- Well, see...

1129
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:37,841
He comes in ...

1130
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,790
and suddenly everybody is
interested in the Church.

1131
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,731
- You know why?
- No.

1132
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,731
Because it takes the outsider.

1133
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,581
Like me. I'm Armenian.

1134
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,301
How many Armenians
do you know in Boston?

1135
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,201
Steve Kurkjian, works at The Globe.

1136
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,131
That's two. You should
get a prize or something.

1137
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,501
- What are you, Italian?
- No, I'm Portugese.

1138
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,131
- From where?
- East Boston.

1139
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,711
Really? East Boston?

1140
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:09,891
You don't sound like it.

1141
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,571
This city.

1142
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,371
This people.

1143
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:23,090
Making the rest of us
feel like we don't belong.

1144
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,420
But they're no better than us.

1145
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,761
Look at how they
treat their children.

1146
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,091
Mark my words Mr. Rezendes,

1147
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,140
if it takes the village
to raise the child,

1148
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:36,231
it takes the village to abuse one.

1149
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,391
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey.

1150
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,010
- You want a beer?
- Love one.

1151
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,661
- Another? You with Barbara?
- No, no.

1152
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,411
- She hates this things.
- Karen too.

1153
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,631
- Yeah.
- Smart ladies.

1154
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:53,751
- Sláinte.
- Sláinte.

1155
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:57,201
I met your new editor.

1156
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,771
- Somebody a decent fella.
- I think he is.

1157
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:07,311
Hey, I had an interesting conversation
with Eric Macleish the other day.

1158
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,451
Turns out he's been
settling abuse cases...

1159
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,661
with the Archdioceses for years.

1160
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,151
You want to talk about this here?

1161
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,181
Jim... You said you helped out...

1162
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,781
on the Father Barrett as a favor.

1163
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,771
That was a loan off?

1164
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,801
How many of these cases
you've been involved with?

1165
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,881
You know I can't answer
that Robby, it's unethical.

1166
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,301
Is that all it is?

1167
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,491
So, this...

1168
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,751
would be the Robby Robinson
I've always...

1169
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,511
heard about, but never met.

1170
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,411
Listen, Jimmy.

1171
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,461
You want to be on
the right side of this.

1172
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,811
This is the Church,
you're talking about Robby.

1173
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,511
Look around,
these are good people,

1174
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,401
done a lot of good
for this city.

1175
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,221
Enjoy the party.

1176
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,851
I've been through
a lot these now.

1177
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,071
"Sick leave" isn't
the only designation...

1178
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,211
they use when they take one...

1179
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,351
of these priests
out of the circulation.

1180
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:20,731
They use slew of terms.
Absent on leave...

1181
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,751
On assign. Emergency response.

1182
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:26,051
- They work for everything, these guys.
- Except belief.

1183
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,551
And they move parishes...

1184
00:59:27,555 --> 00:59:29,311
way more frequently
than other priests.

1185
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:31,541
When I was a kid, priest
moved after 7, 8 years.

1186
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:32,191
Sometimes longer.

1187
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,231
These guys,
it's 2 to 3 years tops.

1188
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:35,741
And did they use
this designation...

1189
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,561
for all Saviano's priests?
- Yeah.

1190
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:40,681
- It's pretty clear pattern.
- Guys, I got Sipe.

1191
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:44,391
<i>I think that if you really
want to understand the crisis...</i>

1192
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,001
<i>you need to start with
the celibacy requirement.</i>

1193
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,781
<i>That was my first
major finding.</i>

1194
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:51,761
<i>Only 50% of the clergy are celibat.</i>

1195
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:55,701
<i>Now, most of them are having
sex with other adults.</i>

1196
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,191
<i>But the fact remains
that this creates...</i>

1197
00:59:58,196 --> 01:00:00,961
<i>a culture of secrecy that
tolerates and even protects...</i>

1198
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:02,251
<i>pedophiles.</i>

1199
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:05,071
So you believe
the Church is aware...

1200
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,331
of the extent of this... crisis?

1201
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,701
<i>Well, absolutely.</i>

1202
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,761
<i>After the first major
scandal in Louisiana...</i>

1203
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:14,231
<i>Tom Doyle, the secretary
candidacy for papal nuncio...</i>

1204
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,671
<i>co-opted a report...</i>

1205
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,081
<i>warning pedophile priests,</i>

1206
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,071
<i>were billion dollar liability.</i>

1207
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,801
<i>That was in 1985.</i>

1208
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:23,341
- 1985?
<i>- That's right.</i>

1209
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:26,971
Who saw that report, anyone
from the catholic hierarchy?

1210
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,381
<i>Sure.</i>

1211
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:30,361
<i>Doyle tried to
introduce the report...</i>

1212
01:00:30,364 --> 01:00:32,491
<i>at the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops.</i>

1213
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:36,311
<i>In fact, Cardinal Law initially
helped to fund the report.</i>

1214
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,781
<i>But then he backed out
and he shelved it.</i>

1215
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,671
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, Richard.

1216
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,311
Robby here.

1217
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,451
We think we have 13 priests...

1218
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:47,830
in Boston, that fits
this pattern, which...

1219
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,001
would be a very,
very big story.

1220
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:52,801
Does that sound right to you?

1221
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,961
In terms of scale?

1222
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,651
<i>No, not really, Robby.</i>

1223
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:58,271
<i>Sounds low to me.</i>

1224
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,221
<i>My estimate suggests 6% act
out sexually with minors.</i>

1225
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,111
6%, of what?

1226
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,410
<i>6% of all priests.</i>

1227
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,781
How many priest do
we have in Boston?

1228
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:13,111
About 1.500, 1% is 15, 6% is...

1229
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,340
90?

1230
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:20,331
- Right, 90 priests.
- Is that possible?

1231
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,521
<i>From a metric standpoint.</i>

1232
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:27,081
<i>Yes. That would certainly
be amount of my findings.</i>

1233
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:34,090
<i>Hello?</i>

1234
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:38,941
90 fucking priests? In Boston?

1235
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,571
That's what he said.

1236
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:44,411
If there were 90 of these
bastards, people would know.

1237
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:45,281
- Maybe they do.

1238
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:47,281
- And no one said a thing?

1239
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,421
Good Germans.

1240
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,590
I don't think that's a comparison
you want to make publicly.

1241
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:54,211
Macleish knew.

1242
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:57,141
- He just didn't say anything.
- That's 13 priests.

1243
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:59,631
There's a big difference
between 13 and 90...

1244
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:01,341
Where's this Sipe guy
getting his numbers?

1245
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,371
Well, he's been studying
it for 30 years...

1246
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,221
He is a trained psychotherapist.

1247
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:07,611
Ok, but we need something
more than a metric from some...

1248
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,261
hippie ex-priest who's
shacking up with the nun.

1249
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,881
Ok so, we'll track
down more victims.

1250
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:14,151
We'll get more priests, then...

1251
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,311
then we could, we could check
them against the directories.

1252
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,851
- That's a shitload of victims.
- We'll get there.

1253
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:20,821
How long is it going to take?

1254
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,211
Too long.

1255
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:27,641
- Wait, what, the meeting is over?
- Yeah, for now.

1256
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,421
- What do you got?
- What if we work backwards?

1257
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:34,071
- What do you mean?
From what?

1258
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,071
- From the directories.

1259
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:37,001
We've been using them
to confirm bad priests.

1260
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:38,581
What if we do it
the other way around.

1261
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,141
Use the directories
so we identify bad priests.

1262
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:41,031
Yeah, exactly.

1263
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,591
We search by designation.

1264
01:02:42,605 --> 01:02:44,081
You know, we look
for any priest...

1265
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,531
on a sick leave or unassigned.

1266
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:46,331
- But who've been
moved around a lot.

1267
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:47,331
- Yeah.

1268
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,841
Which can take a longer work.

1269
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,851
Well, not if we're all on it.

1270
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:52,230
You too?

1271
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:54,611
Generally, that's what
all means, yeah.

1272
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:55,781
Yeah, generally.

1273
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:58,910

1274

- That's it.

Holy shit! Robby?

1292
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:18,141
That's 3 off Sipe estimate,
that's incredible.

Robby!

- How many?
- 87.

1295
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:22,801
87 priests in Boston.

1296
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:28,031
- Call Macleish.
I want to talk to him.

1297
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:28,431
- Ok.

1298
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,231
- Can you print it?

1299
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,231

I need you to tell me
something, Jim.

1306
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,471
- Could it be 90 priests?
- What?

1307
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:55,741
Could it be as high as 90?

<i>Jesus, Robby!</i>

I wouldn't be asking
if it wasn't important.

01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,301
<i>You're gonna stop this, Robby.</i>

1312
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,381
Robby, Macleish's assistant...

1313
01:06:14,389 --> 01:06:16,250
said he's all booked up,
he can't see us.

1314
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,861
Yeah, well, the hell he can't.

1315
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:25,781
Alright, it'll be fine.

1316
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,601
- You know I'll not catch
up with you, ok? - Ok.

1317
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:36,311
Hey guys, I'm really sorry,
I am, I don't have any ...

1318
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,241
time to talk right now but...

1319
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:38,341
- Mr. Macleish.
- If you call my assistant.

1320
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,336
We have reasons to believe
that there are...

1321
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,961
allegations against as many
as 87 priests in Boston.

1322
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,481
I can't talk to you about that.

1323
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,141
Does that number
sound right to you?

1324
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:47,151
You gotta be kidding me,
I just told you...

1325
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:48,551
I don't have time for this crap.

1326
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:50,811
Eric, how many
priests did you sign?

1327
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:53,701
Robby, you know
I can't tell you that.

1328
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:54,971
You're going to give
me their names...

1329
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,671
and the names of their victims.

1330
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:00,231
- Are you threatening me?

1331
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,231
- We've got two stories here.

1332
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:04,461
We got a story
about degenerate clergy.

1333
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:06,661
And we got a story
about a bunch of lawyers...

1334
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:09,301
turning child abuse
into a cottage industry.

1335
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:11,931
Now, which story do
you want us to write?

1336
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,871
Cause we're writing one of them.

1337
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:19,951
I already sent you
a list of names.

1338
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:22,921
What are you talking about?
To whom?

1339
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,461
The Globe, years ago.

1340
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:28,111
After the Porter case
I got plenty of calls.

1341
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:29,261
I had 20 priests...

1342
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,411
in Boston alone.

1343
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:32,411
But I couldn't go after
them without the press.

1344
01:07:32,445 --> 01:07:34,231
So I sent you guys...

1345
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,861
a list of names
and you buried it.

1346
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:40,371
- I want those names tomorrow.

1347
01:07:40,373 --> 01:07:42,371
- Check you goddamn clips, Robby.

1348
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,451
- I didn't find anything in the clips.
- Yeah, big surprise.

1349
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:51,561
Richard...

1350
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:53,761
Do you still go to mass?

1351
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,531
<i>No, I haven't been to Church
for some time now.</i>

1352
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,751
<i>But I still consider
myself a catholic.</i>

1353
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:00,601
How does that work?

1354
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,561
<i>Well, the Church is
an institution, Mike.</i>

1355
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,061
<i>Made of men.</i>

1356
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:08,971
<i>It's passing...
My faith is in the eternal.</i>

1357
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:11,281
<i>I try to separate the two.</i>

1358
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:13,281
Sounds tricky.

1359
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,230
<i>It is. Especially...</i>

1360
01:08:15,235 --> 01:08:17,451
<i>since the Church continues
to go after me.</i>

1361
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:19,481
<i>It takes the toll, Mike.</i>

1362
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:21,961
<i>They'll try to silence
anyone who speaks out.</i>

1363
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,440
<i>And I'm sure they'll come after you
and your team soon enough.</i>

1364
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,741
Really? And how do you
think they'll do that?

1365
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,171
Hello? Richard?

1366
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:42,931
- Who is it?
- It's the Archbishop of Canterbury.

1367
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:49,101
I had dinner at Santarpio's,
that's some leftovers.

1368
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:50,351
You're the freaking best.

1369
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:52,741
Thanks. You want a beer?

1370
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:55,111
- Yeah.
- You got it.

1371
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:58,101
Jesus. How much longer...

1372
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,291
you're gonna be
in this shithole??

1373
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:00,831
Yeah, I'm working on it.

1374
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,121
- She's a good girl, Mike.
- Yeah, she is.

1375
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:07,811
We'll figure it out. I haven't
had a lot of time lately.

1376
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:10,771
I just got off the phone
with Sipe, actually.

1377
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,171
Have you met this
guy in person yet?

1378
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:16,261
No, but his knowledge on this
is on a whole other level.

1379
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:18,130
I'm freaking starving.

1380
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:22,101
So, where are we with the 90?

1381
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:24,901
- I'm close.
- How close?

1382
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:26,171
I'm close.

1383
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:27,841
Just answer the question, will ya?

1384
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:32,741
We got 87 names.

1385
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,680
We're trying to get confirmation,
I think we will.

1386
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,621
Something bugging you?

1387
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:42,071
It's just surprise, that's all.

1388
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:45,001
Yeah, yeah it is.

1389
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:46,650
For everybody.

1390
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:54,431
Hey, Ben, I forgot to ask you.

1391
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:56,931
Hey Phil Saviano
said he sent a bunch of...

1392
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,601
info over to The Globe a years ago,
do you have an idea to whom?

1393
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,991
- No, why?
- Well, I'm just curious.

1394
01:10:03,004 --> 01:10:04,910
I wanted to see if there's any
lead you guys didn't worn out.

1395
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,141
Saviano was a fucking train wreck...

1396
01:10:07,147 --> 01:10:08,890
5 years ago, but we
didn't miss anything.

1397
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,761
This story needs Spotlight.

1398
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:14,271
Yeah, I agree.
I'm just following up.

1399
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,971
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

1400
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:24,871
- This is unbelievable.

1401
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,471
- When did you get this?

1402
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:28,321
Macleish emailed
the list this morning.

1403
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:31,001
He settled cases
against 45 priests.

1404
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,191
Where are we on Law?

1405
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,711
Anything that shows
the acknowledge of this.

1406
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,401
- Still working Garabedian.
But nothing concrete.

1407
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:41,045
I keep thinking about that
conversation we had the other night,

1408
01:10:41,047 --> 01:10:43,271
about how Law called
down the power of God.

1409
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:45,641
When we reported the Porter.

1410
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:47,551
That's just Law being Law.

1411
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:49,881
Ok, but I checked the clips...

1412
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:52,171
And Porter, isn't even...

1413
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,331
in Boston Archdiocese,
he's from Fall River.

1414
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:55,370
So...

1415
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,161
Why the extreme reaction?

1416
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:03,431
Law had to know.
That's why he had the reaction.

1417
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,251
Senior than others.

1418
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:10,451
I think that's
the bigger story.

1419
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:13,521
Bigger than 50 priests?

1420
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,381
If it came from
the top down? Yes.

1421
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,151
But the numbers clearly indicate that
there were senior clergy involved.

1422
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:21,401
- That's all they do "indicate".

1423
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:22,451
- Are you telling me that...

1424
01:11:22,453 --> 01:11:25,231
that if we run a story about
50 pedophile priests in Boston.

1425
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:26,101
- Mike.

1426
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:29,001
- We're going to the same cat
fight you got in to on Porter.

1427
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:30,381
Which made a lot of noise,

1428
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,351
but changed things not one bit.

1429
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,621
We need to focus
on the institution.

1430
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,291
Not the individual priests.

1431
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:41,531
Practice and policy.

1432
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,581
Show me the Church
manipulate the system...

1433
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:45,271
so this guy wouldn't
have to face charges.

1434
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,140
Show me they put
those same priests...

1435
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,631
back into parishes
time and time again.

1436
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:52,911
Show me this was systemic
that it came from the top down.

1437
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:56,841
Sound like we're
going after Law.

1438
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,911
We're going after the system.

1439
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,461
Make the list of all the victims...

1440
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,011
we have, start reaching out.

1441
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:11,281
- And bring Matt in if you need help.
- Ok.

1442
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,660
- Hey when do you go to Springfield?
- Hearing's on monday.

1443
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:14,830
Ok.

1444
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,681
Hey, Robby, you got a second?

1445
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:18,231
Yeah.

1446
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,841
I, I got one of those treatment
centers a block from my house.

1447
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:26,651
We got neighbours with kids.

1448
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,351
I know that the work we do
is confidential but,

1449
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:30,641
I'm feeling like...

1450
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:32,791
I should tell 'em.

1451
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:38,611
- We'll tell 'em soon.

1452
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,611
- Are you sure?

1453
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,291
- Yeah.
- Ok.

1454
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,821
Hi there, I'm Sacha Pfeiffer,
with The Boston Globe.

1455
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:51,661
It's just looking for the gentleman
by the name of Matthew Walsh?

1456
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:54,580
No, he's not.

1457
01:12:59,301 --> 01:13:00,816
- Take there right.
- Ok.

1458
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:08,751
- Hi
- Hi.

1459
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:10,361
I'm Sacha Pfeiffer
from The Boston Globe.

1460
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,121
Yeah, what do you want?

1461
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,251
I'd like to speak
with Thomas Kennedy?

1462
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:14,291
He doesn't live here any more.

1463
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:15,811
Do you know where he lives?

1464
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:17,810
Ser, I'd just like to ask a few...

1465
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:21,431
Sacha Pfeiffer, Boston Globe.

1466
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:23,181
- Oh, yeah, hi.
- Hi. Thank you.

1467
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,001
- Anything else you can recall?
- No.

1468
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:29,881
No, but I got
a cousin in Queens...

1469
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,731
he sure saw him in the streets
a few years later.

1470
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,121
<i>The bishop came
over to house.</i>

1471
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:36,111
He said nothing like this
ever happened before...

1472
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:37,681
and he asked us not
to press charges.

1473
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,151
And what did your mother do?

1474
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:40,896
My mother?

1475
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,321
She put out freakin cookies.

1476
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:50,891
<i>There was a lot of
pressure to keep quiet.</i>

1477
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:51,691
From the Church?

1478
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,281
Yeah, from the Church.
But not just the Church.

1479
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:57,801
From my friends.

1480
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,291
From the other parishoners.

1481
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:03,071
<i>Well, many of the priest
I treated were...</i>

1482
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:04,541
<i>psychosexually stunted.</i>

1483
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:07,421
<i>On the emotional level of
the 12 or 13 year old.</i>

1484
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:08,321
Jesus.

1485
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:10,721
Sure the chief knew.
EVerybody knew.

1486
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:12,561
But nobody wants
to come for priest.

1487
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,471
And what about the prosecutor?

1488
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:18,191
I shouldn't talk about this shit.

1489
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,601
I think you should, actually.

1490
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:23,641
Do you know Father Hurley
or Father Gale?

1491
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:24,401
I do.

1492
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:25,681
Just get your shit
out of here, alright?

1493
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:26,681
I'm sorry about it.

1494
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:28,071
You leave me alone,
you leave my brother alone...

1495
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:29,100
you hear me goddammit?

1496
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,281
Hi there.
I'm looking for Ronald Paquin.

1497
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:41,310
Yes?

1498
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:44,641
- You're Father Paquin?
- Yes, that's right.

1499
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,131
I'm Sacha Pfeiffer
from The Boston Globe.

1500
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:48,991
Ok.

1501
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:50,571
Could I ask you a few questions?

1502
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,600
Go ahead, dear.

1503
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:54,681
We spoke to several men who
knew you when they were boys...

1504
01:14:54,683 --> 01:14:56,541
at St. John the Baptist in Haverhill.

1505
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,071
They told us you molested
them, is that true?

1506
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,531
Sure, I fooled around.

1507
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:07,661
But I never felt gratified myself.

1508
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:13,011
Right, but you admit to molesting
the boys at St. John the Baptist?

1509
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:18,091
Yes, yes, but as I said,
I never got any pleasure from them.

1510
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,051
That's important to understand.

1511
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,451
Right, but...

1512
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:26,411
Can you tell me where and how
you fooled around with these boys?

1513
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:31,551
I want to be clear,
I never raped anybody.

1514
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:34,891
There's a difference.
I should know.

1515
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:37,881
- How would you know?
- I was raped.

1516
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,611
I'm sorry, who raped you?

1517
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:44,001
<i>Darling, who are
you talking too?</i>

1518
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,641
- It's ok, Jane.
- Father, who raped you?

1519
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:46,670
Who are you?

1520
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:50,321
- Sacha Pfeiffer, from The Globe.
- Please, get off my porch.

1521
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,511
- Get inside the house, Ronald.
- Mister...

1522
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:54,541
- Get inside once!
- Alright.

1523
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:56,581
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I'm his sister.

1524
01:15:56,930 --> 01:15:59,001
- And I don't want you coming back here.
- Miss Paquin?

1525
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,571
No, you won't,
I beat you last time....

1526
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:11,811
Cause you cheated...

1527
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,611
Could you please clarify
The Globe's position for me, Mr. Albano?

1528
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,801
Yes, Judge Sweeney.

1529
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:32,111
Our argument to make
this documents public rest...

1530
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:34,611
mainly on First Amendment grounds.

1531
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:37,141
We also have a number
of other relevant arguments.

1532
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:39,991
After all, Your Honor,
this was discretionary audit.

1533
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:42,741
Yes, it was made
the Judges discretionary.

1534
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:43,770
Hey Mike!

1535
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:45,910
Hey, Joe.

1536
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,661
What's the Spotlight
reporter doing in Springfield?

1537
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:53,291
Your boy Albano is sliding uphill.

1538
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,431
Actually thinking he has
a shot of winning this thing?

1539
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,221
You want me to comment
for The Herald?

1540
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:02,301
Globe reporter would not comment.

1541
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:05,411
But he did not seem hopeful.

1542
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,601
He didn't try
to hide it at all.

1543
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:11,941
He had this really odd
rationalization for it,

1544
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,431
like it was totally normal
to fool around with little boys.

1545
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:17,750
I'd really like to go back,
I think he'd talk to us.

1546
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,681
Oh, we will.

1547
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:21,691
Just not yet.

1548
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:24,691
I want you to stay focused
on the victims right now.

1549
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:26,691
Sacha, where did they send
Father Talbot again?

1550
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:30,621
- I think, wasn't it at Scheffers.
- Scheffers, that's right.

1551
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:33,571
Wait, Father Talbot, from BCI?

1552
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,151
- Yeah, you know him?

1553
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:37,251
- Yeah, he was there when I was.

1554
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,911
- We have a victim?
- Yeah.

1555
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:41,901
Lives in Providence.

1556
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:47,491
There's nothing personal
within this documents, Your Honor.

1557
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:50,051
They can serve how
the Cardinal is handling ...

1558
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:51,541
Say the "Archdiocese".

1559
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:53,510
Excuse me?

1560
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:57,021
You don't get to tag the Cardinal
with everything, Mr. Albano.

1561
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:58,931
Say, the Archdiocese.

1562
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,581
Judge Sweeney, The Globe
is not a party to this case.

1563
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:02,921
They just want to
sell the papers.

1564
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,981
If Mr. Garabedian, had not...

1565
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:06,771
smeared the Cardinal's good name...

1566
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:08,611
- we wouldn't even be here.
- Your Honor,

1567
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:10,711
I object to the use
of the word "smear".

1568
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:13,571
- Duly noted, Mr. Garabedian.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1569
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,881
- Anything else, Mr. Rogers?
- No, Your Honor.

1570
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:17,791
Sr. Albano, you may continue.

1571
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:19,591
The Globe's really having...

1572
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:22,881
Hola Mitch, how you doin'?

1573
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:25,170
I'm fine.

1574
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,561
He's tough that Wilson Rogers.

1575
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:29,811
He's smug.

1576
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:33,131
- He's sloppy.
- Doesn't seem sloppy.

1577
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,221
You don't know
the half of it. Trust me.

1578
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:38,531
What's the half of it?

1579
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:42,601
Tell me the half of it, Mitch?

1580
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,360
- Of the record.
- Of the record, yeah.

1581
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:52,290
3 years ago I get the call
from an ex-priest.

1582
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,191
Anthony Benzevich.

1583
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:56,366
He was at Blessed Sacrament
back in '62...

1584
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:57,751
and he saw Geoghan.

1585
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:02,681
Taking little boys up to
the rectory bedroom, ok?

1586
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:03,801
So he's bold, alright?

1587
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:05,451
- Alright.
- Tells the bishop about it.

1588
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:08,101
And the bishop
threatens to reassign him.

1589
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:10,921
- To South America.
- Jesus.

1590
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:13,241
Yeah.
Alright, so fast-forward 35 years.

1591
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:15,328
Benzevich reads that Geoghan
has been charged...

1592
01:19:15,329 --> 01:19:17,331
with molesting hundreds of kids.

1593
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:19,421
Alright, so he feels guilty
and he calls me.

1594
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,631
So you have
a testimony of a priest...

1595
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:24,071
telling his superiors
about Geoghan in '62?

1596
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:25,871
No, I do not.

1597
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:28,471
Because when I call Benzevich
in to give a deposition...

1598
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:30,331
He comes in with the lawyer.

1599
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:32,461
- Wilson Rogers?
- Right.

1600
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:35,671
And suddenly Father Benzevich
has a very foggy memory.

1601
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:37,741
Can't remember anything.
He's useless.

1602
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,421
So, I go back to work.
I forget about it, whatever.

1603
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:43,931
Until about a year ago, I find
an article about a priest...

1604
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:46,421
who warned Church officials
about Geoghan.

1605
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,541
- Benzevich went to the press?
- Yeah.

1606
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:50,651
Yeah, local paper Patriot Ledger,

1607
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:53,241
nobody saw it, but now
I got Benzevich on record.

1608
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,148
so, I file a motion to depose...

1609
01:19:55,152 --> 01:19:56,531
Benzevich the second time.

1610
01:19:57,070 --> 01:20:00,331
Alright? And Wilson Rogers,
that smug son of a bitch,

1611
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:03,141
he files a motion,
opposing my motion.

1612
01:20:03,610 --> 01:20:05,411
And that's when I have him.

1613
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,791
- Have, have him how?

1614
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,761
- Rogers opposes my motion.

1615
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,382
So I have to make an argument
as to why am I allowed to...

1616
01:20:12,385 --> 01:20:14,981
depose Father Benzevich
the second time, ok?

1617
01:20:14,991 --> 01:20:17,251
But this time I'm allowed
to attach exhibits.

1618
01:20:17,870 --> 01:20:18,911
- You follow what I'm saying?

1619
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:20,711
- The sealed documents?

1620
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:22,561
Yes. I can attach
the sealed documents...

1621
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:25,281
that I've gotten in discovery,
Mr. Rezendes.

1622
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:28,721
The same documents that your
paper is currently suing for.

1623
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:30,621
- You're shitting me?

1624
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:32,621
- What? No, no,
I'm not shitting you.

1625
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:35,641
So, I pull out the 14
most eminent docs...

1626
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:36,941
and I attach them to my motion.

1627
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,641
And they prove everything.
Everything.

1628
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:41,391
About the Church, about
the bishops, about Law.

1629
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,601
And it's all public...

1630
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,301
Because your motion...

1631
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,940
to oppose Rogers motion is public.

1632
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:49,241
Is public, yeah. Exactly.
Now you're paying attention.

1633
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:51,721
And so I could just walk in
to that courthouse right now...

1634
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,821
and get those documents?

1635
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:54,231
No, you can not.

1636
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,431
Because the documents
are not there.

1637
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,051
But you just said
they're public.

1638
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:01,366
I know I did.
But this is Boston.

1639
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,301
And the Church does not
want them to be found,

1640
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,501
so, they are not there.

1641
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:11,091
Mitch, are you telling me
that the Catholic Church...

1642
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,494
removed legal documents
from that courthouse?

1643
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:16,881
- Look, I'm not crazy,
I'm not paranoid.

1644
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,431
I'm experienced.

1645
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:20,431
Check the docket, you'll see.

1646
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:23,001
They control everything.

1647
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:27,020
Everything.

1648
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:30,291
I got to go back.

1649
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:36,931
I just got the fucking documents!

1650
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:54,361
- Docket entry number 49,
with the Geoghan case.

1651
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,361
- Ok, thanks.

1652
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:58,071
- We're closing in 10 minutes.
- 10 minutes? Alright.

1653
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,966
- Rev. James F. Talbot -

1654
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:36,761
- Robby.
- Hey, it's me.

1655
01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:38,351
- Hey.
- You're not gonna believe it.

1656
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,001
Garabedian gave me a tip.

1657
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:42,631
Some of the sealed
docs are already public.

1658
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:44,041
They're part of
the motioning file.

1659
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:46,171
<i>He said they're the best of
a bunch, we don't have to...</i>

1660
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,541
<i>wait for Sweeney's ruling.</i>

1661
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:48,731
So, we can get them?

1662
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:50,251
Yeah, but they
are not there.

1663
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:51,251
I already talked to Albano,

1664
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:52,741
he said all we
have to do is...

1665
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:53,971
file a motion
and Sweeney will...

1666
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,150
order Mitch to refile the docs.

1667
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,731
And you think
this documents are...?

1668
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,791
<i>He said this 14 docs
are all we need.</i>

1669
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:00,931
<i>They are huge.</i>

1670
01:23:01,099 --> 01:23:04,991
- Ok. I'll call Ben.
Good work.

1671
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,441
- What happened?

1672
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:34,041
- They are saying
it's a prop plane.

1673
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:35,571
But that's not a prop plane.

1674
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:40,757
Tell Linda to get every...

1675
01:23:40,759 --> 01:23:42,510
reporter we have in here now.

1676
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:48,211
<i>You pray for the victims,
you pray for the injured...</i>

1677
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:51,481
<i>and you pray for
those who survived.</i>

1678
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:55,751
<i>You pray too for the nation.</i>

1679
01:23:57,010 --> 01:23:59,081
<i>That our response to this...</i>

1680
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:03,681
<i>might reflect the best
ideals of our nation.</i>

1681
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:07,221
<i>And even more reflect
God's own teaching.</i>

1682
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:11,821
<i>Not only as it's shown in
Christianity and Judaism...</i>

1683
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:14,231
<i>but in Islam as well.</i>

1684
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:16,841
- Not bad. Who's there?
- Paulson.

1685
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:18,561
I want to talk to
him when he's back.

1686
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:21,061
Did Rezendes find a way
to get to Florida yet?

1687
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:22,911
They just opened
the airport in Providence,

1688
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:24,161
he's on his way there now.

1689
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:25,681
- Ben I'm gonna need more
people on mass report.

1690
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:27,681
- I'll give you three of my guys.

1691
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:29,811
Robby, put your team on that too.
Got it.

1692
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:32,521
- And Robby, everything else stops.
- Understood.

1693
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:35,121
- Why is Mike going to Florida?
- Flight school.

1694
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:36,340
That's where they
learned to fly.

1695
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,131
Robby, I've got...

1696
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:40,001
a lot of victims
introduce set up this week.

1697
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:41,281
- We got to cancel them.

1698
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:42,481
- That's gonna be hard.

1699
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,141
I know.

1700
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:44,411
This is nuts. Two days ago...

1701
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:45,631
I told my wife we
gotta be working...

1702
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,931
on biggest story
on the planet.

1703
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:50,441
- Boston Globe.
- Boston Globe, one moment please.

1704
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,351
- Yes if you have a tip, I...
- Boston Globe...

1705
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:55,941
Mitchell Garabedian.

1706
01:24:55,970 --> 01:24:57,721
<i>Mitch, it's Mike.
I've been trying to reach you.</i>

1707
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,541
I don't have time to talk
to you Mr. Rezendes.

1708
01:24:59,570 --> 01:25:02,141
Hey just quickly. Did you
refile those docs yet?

1709
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:03,356
<i>No, I just got the order.</i>

1710
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:04,281
<i>It takes time.</i>

1711
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:05,521
- Ok, great.
Can you hold off...

1712
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:06,421
on refiling...
<i>- Hold on?</i>

1713
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,241
I have to go to Florida...

1714
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,151
Once you refile,
they're public.

1715
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:10,981
Other newspaper will be able
to get a hold of them.

1716
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:13,421
<i>"Other newspapers
are not my concern.</i>

1717
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,101
<i>I received the judicial order.</i>

1718
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,101
<i>I told you the Church
is watching me.</i>

1719
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,411
Hey Mitch, please.

1720
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,080
All I need is
a few more weeks.

1721
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,241
<i>I can't make any promises.
Goodbye.</i>

1722
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,771
Mitch! Mitch! Shit!

1723
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:28,760
Shit.

1724
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:39,111
<i>Look, I get it.</i>

1725
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,311
<i>No one wants to read about
kids getting raped by priests.</i>

1726
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:42,871
Especially now, but you asked...

1727
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:44,091
a lot of people to relive...

1728
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,091
some very painful experiences...

1729
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:48,431
Phil you know why we were
taking off of this story...

1730
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:50,171
It's been six weeks since 9/11.

1731
01:25:50,190 --> 01:25:52,471
I realize that, and we're
gonna get back to it.

1732
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:53,491
When?

1733
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:57,281
You're doing the same thing
you guys did the last time.

1734
01:25:57,295 --> 01:25:57,781
No.

1735
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:58,971
- You're dropping us.
- No.

1736
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,760
Maybe I should tell
The Herald that story.

1737
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:03,821
Ok, Phil. You go
ahead and do that.

1738
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:06,521
It'll undo all
the work we've done.

1739
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:07,821
But I can't stop you.

1740
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,121
Listen to me.

1741
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,511
I am here because I care.

1742
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:16,951
We're not going away.

1743
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,761
We're gonna tell this story,
we're gonna tell it right.

1744
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:21,281
We just need a little more time.

1745
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,811
That's all we're asking for.

1746
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:27,071
Why bother asking?

1747
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:30,161
You're gonna do
what you want anyway.

1748
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:32,761
You always do.

1749
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:36,521
Phil... Phil!

1750
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:43,711
- Hey.

1751
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:45,111
- How's South Beach?

1752
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,401
It's Pointe Beach.

1753
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:48,401
Remarkably different place.

1754
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,441
What's up?

1755
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,681
<i>Mitch Garabedian called me today.</i>

1756
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:53,221
Why did he call you?

1757
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,521
<i>Because he knew
you'd yell at him.</i>

1758
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,321
<i>He refiled the docs.</i>

1759
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:57,491
What?

1760
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:59,491
Robby, those docs are public now.

1761
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:00,975
<i>We got to get there before
everybody else does.</i>

1762
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:02,121
I know, I know, I know.

1763
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:04,121
Just wrap up whatever
you're doing...

1764
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:05,591
and get the first flight out.

1765
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:07,711
<i>I'll book the flight now and go
straigth to the courthouse tomorrow.</i>

1766
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:09,661
- Alright, call me when you get in.
- Ok.

1767
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:14,751
Robby, I'll go to a Phil Saviano
now that we're back on it.

1768
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:16,151
Good idea.

1769
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,151
Go and have dinner with Hansi.

1770
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:19,841
Might be the last
time for a while.

1771
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:26,821
- Robby...
- Yeah?

1772
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:29,570
After we saw Macleish, I started
going back through the clips...

1773
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,661
and I had a little time
last week finally, so...

1774
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:35,431
I found that.

1775
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:37,531
It's from'93.

1776
01:27:39,650 --> 01:27:41,301
<i>Lawyer for Porter victims says...</i>

1777
01:27:41,310 --> 01:27:43,110
<i>20 other priests in
area are accused.</i>

1778
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:49,270
Is that it?

1779
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:53,051
Yeah, yeah... That's it.

1780
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:59,491
- Good night.
- Ok. Good night.

1781
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,691
So I was probably a few
years after you, right?

1782
01:28:41,705 --> 01:28:44,801
No, you were more
than a few. Believe me.

1783
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,651
After the BC High,
I came down to Providence...

1784
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,491
I played hockey for the Friars.

1785
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:53,632
Oh well, you must've
been pretty good.

1786
01:28:53,732 --> 01:28:55,891
No, rode the bench
in college. Yeah.

1787
01:28:56,310 --> 01:28:57,401
But I love the city.

1788
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,281
And we just had
our third kid...

1789
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:02,551
and I still get my Globe
for the record.

1790
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,821
That's good to know,
good to know.

1791
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:06,871
Look, Kevin...

1792
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:09,671
It's actually why I'm here.

1793
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:12,261
I...

1794
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:15,161
Need to ask you some
questions about Father Talbot.

1795
01:29:22,670 --> 01:29:23,841
- How'd you find out?

1796
01:29:24,970 --> 01:29:26,241
- Well...

1797
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:29,131
I guess it doesn't matter.

1798
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:37,571
I never even told my wife.

1799
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:40,720
Excuse me!

1800
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:47,858
- Hey, hey, I need
to get in there!

1801
01:29:47,865 --> 01:29:48,641
- We're closed.

1802
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:49,951
Come on, let me in,
5 minutes.

1803
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:50,941
I'm sorry, we're closed.

1804
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:52,351
C'mon. 5 minutes.

1805
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,640
Fuck!

1806
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:08,801
Here you go.

1807
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:14,121
- This is the Geoghan case?
- That's right.

1808
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:16,411
- Those records are sealed.

1809
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,011
- No. That's a public motion.

1810
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:19,421
Those record are public.

1811
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:20,821
Look, I work for The Globe.

1812
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:22,820
Good for you.

1813
01:30:24,890 --> 01:30:26,121
- Can I talk to your supervisor?

1814
01:30:26,139 --> 01:30:27,311
- He's not in today.

1815
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:29,471
What about a Judge?

1816
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:31,861
There must be Judges that
work on this kind of thing.

1817
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:33,740
6th floor.

1818
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,121
We understand the nature...

1819
01:30:42,298 --> 01:30:43,840
of the allegations
against Father Talbot.

1820
01:30:44,410 --> 01:30:47,271
I'm just not sure what you
want from President Kemeza.

1821
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:50,591
- Talbot taught here long
before Bill took over.

1822
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:51,691
- Of course.

1823
01:30:51,850 --> 01:30:53,991
We just want to know
if that's possible...

1824
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:56,141
that the President,
the Faculty, the Board...

1825
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:58,050
that no one knew what
was going on at the time.

1826
01:30:58,190 --> 01:31:00,331
I graduated in 1979 and...

1827
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:02,331
I had no idea
about any of this, so...

1828
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:04,161
If you're suggesting
that Father Gibbons...

1829
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:06,101
and Father Callahan,
had in anyway...

1830
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,841
Gibbons and Callahan...

1831
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,041
I'm hearing this
place was like the Navy.

1832
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:12,401
You really think
they didn't know?

1833
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,331
It's a big school, Robby.
You know that.

1834
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:18,331
And we're talking
about seven...

1835
01:31:18,336 --> 01:31:20,441
alleged victims over
what, eight years?

1836
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:23,841
Well, we're talking about, you know...
Seven that we know about.

1837
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:25,521
This is ridiculous!

1838
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,021
- You're reaching for the story here...
- Jack. Jack, Jack.

1839
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:32,791
If I had been President then,
I would have known.

1840
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:35,621
Bill, I'm not sure
that's relevant.

1841
01:31:35,650 --> 01:31:38,351
Why do you think they sent
Talbot up to Cheverus?

1842
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,701
You know, they wanted
him out of town.

1843
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:43,551
Robby...

1844
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:45,901
As well intentioned this
Bill's remarks are,

1845
01:31:45,904 --> 01:31:47,820
I'm hoping we can
keep this between us...

1846
01:31:47,823 --> 01:31:50,100
until we all get
on the same page.

1847
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:55,681
Is that why we are here?
To get on the same page?

1848
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,171
No. We're here because
you're in the poor...

1849
01:31:57,290 --> 01:31:59,031
dilemmas Robby and a friend.

1850
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:01,071
Exactly. And we know...

1851
01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:03,091
you care about
the school as much as we do.

1852
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:07,191
Did you play your
sport here, Jack?

1853
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:09,011
Yeah, football. Why?

1854
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:10,921
I ran track.

1855
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:13,321
You know, I went to
Providence yesterday...

1856
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:15,501
talked to one of
Father Talbot victims.

1857
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:18,299
He played hockey here...
And...

1858
01:32:18,333 --> 01:32:19,601
He was one of
the better ones...

1859
01:32:19,623 --> 01:32:21,511
He's got wife, kids...

1860
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:23,491
good job.

1861
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:26,491
About 10 minutes
into the conversation...

1862
01:32:27,930 --> 01:32:29,281
guy breaks down.

1863
01:32:29,890 --> 01:32:31,411
You know, couldn't stop crying.

1864
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:34,771
Said he could never
figure out why...

1865
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,551
Father Talbot picked him.

1866
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:41,211
Father Talbot coached
the hockey team.

1867
01:32:43,370 --> 01:32:44,401
So...

1868
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:47,791
I guess we just got lucky.

1869
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:49,791
You and me.

1870
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:57,871
Does Jack Dunn
work for the school?

1871
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:00,110
No. He's PR for
the Boston College.

1872
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:02,091
They call him
when they need help.

1873
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,051
And Pete Conley,
why was he there?

1874
01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:05,311
Good question.

1875
01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:07,311
Pete's a bigger lump, but
I called Bill directly...

1876
01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:08,741
and I asked for
the sit down.

1877
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:10,341
I never mentioned anybody else.

1878
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,264
Looks like everybody
already knows the story.

1879
01:33:14,477 --> 01:33:16,511
Yeah, except us...

1880
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,901
and we work right there.

1881
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,531
- Judge Volterra?
- Yes.

1882
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,891
Hi, I'm Mike Rezendes
from The Boston Globe.

1883
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,331
I've been having some troubles...

1884
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:29,491
accessing some public records
down in the records room.

1885
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,201
I was wondering if I can
have a word with you?

1886
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,571
- Alright.
- Thank you.

1887
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:42,131
These exhibits you're
after Mr. Rezendes...

1888
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,041
They're very sensitive records.

1889
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:48,371
With all due respect Your Honor,
that's not the question.

1890
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:50,551
The records are public.

1891
01:33:51,870 --> 01:33:53,861
Maybe so, but tell me...

1892
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:56,728
Where is the editorial
responsibility...

1893
01:33:56,733 --> 01:33:58,641
in publishing records
of this nature?

1894
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:00,581
Well, where is the editorial
responsibility...

1895
01:34:00,596 --> 01:34:02,141
in not publishing them?

1896
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:15,251
You can't take those.
You need to make copies.

1897
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:18,041
- I'm going to the copy room.
- It's been closed at 4 p.m.

1898
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,831
Look, I'll give you...

1899
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:28,631
$83 to use yours.

1900
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,241
Hey, cab!

1901
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:40,331
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1902
01:34:43,190 --> 01:34:45,281
Take me to The Boston Globe
on Morrissey Boulevard.

1903
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,971
Don't take 93,
take Dorchester Avenue.

1904
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:52,231
<i>Robby, it's incredible.</i>

1905
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:55,491
<i>Law knew about Geoghan
for years, no question.</i>

1906
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:57,741
<i>There's a letter to Law...</i>

1907
01:34:57,755 --> 01:35:00,141
<i>from a woman Martha Gallet
who lived in Jamaica Plain...</i>

1908
01:35:00,150 --> 01:35:01,940
<i>in early '80 when Geoghan
was there.</i>

1909
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:02,760
<i>Listen to this.</i>

1910
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:05,541
<i>Our family is rooted in
the Church.</i>

1911
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:08,321
<i>Our desire is to protect
the holy orders.</i>

1912
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:10,671
<i>Even in the midst
of our agony...</i>

1913
01:35:10,682 --> 01:35:12,271
<i>over the seven boys
in our family...</i>

1914
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,071
<i>who have been violated.</i>

1915
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:15,981
<i>Seven Robby.
Seven boys!</i>

1916
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:19,231
<i>It was suggested
that we keep silent.</i>

1917
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:21,681
<i>We did not question
the authority of the Church...</i>

1918
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,928
<i>two years ago.</i>

1919
01:35:23,062 --> 01:35:25,851
<i>But since, Father Geoghan
is still in his parish.</i>

1920
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:29,261
<i>Which she send it to Law
and Law did shit!</i>

1921
01:35:29,730 --> 01:35:31,521
<i>Here's another one
to Law, same year.</i>

1922
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:32,621
<i>Listen to this.</i>

1923
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:35,821
<i>Order of a recent
assaignment to Father Geoghan...</i>

1924
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:38,371
<i>as an associate at
Saint Julius in Weston...</i>

1925
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:41,671
<i>Father Geoghan has a history
of homosexual involvement...</i>

1926
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:43,221
<i>with young boys.</i>

1927
01:35:43,528 --> 01:35:45,941
<i>I understand his recent departure
from San Brendan's may be...</i>

1928
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:47,341
<i>related to this problem.</i>

1929
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:49,321
I wonder if Father Geoghan
should not be...

1930
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:51,211
reduced to just
weekend work while...

1931
01:35:51,221 --> 01:35:52,650
receiving some kind of therapy.

1932
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:55,791
You know how grateful I am to
you for you constant concern...

1933
01:35:55,810 --> 01:35:57,621
sincerely yours and our Lord,

1934
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:59,431
most reverend John M. Darcy...

1935
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:03,071
Auxiliary Bishop of Boston,
December 7. 1984.

1936
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:04,351
- An Auxiliary Bishop wrote that?

1937
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,551
- That's incredible.

1938
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:09,471
He broke ranks, I mean...
When did Gallet write that letter?

1939
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:10,651
- 1984.

1940
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:11,851
- And Law just ignored it.

1941
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,581
How do you ignore
that freaking letter?

1942
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:14,751
We got them.

1943
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:17,251
You can't read this letters
and think anything else.

1944
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:18,151
It's proof.

1945
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:19,871
Yeah, it is.

1946
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:22,161
- This is good work.

1947
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:24,161
- Should we take it up to Ben?

1948
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,941
- No, not yet.

1949
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:29,641
- Why not?

1950
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:31,481
We got Law. This is it.

1951
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:34,251
No, this is Law
covering for one priest.

1952
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,611
There's other 90 out there.

1953
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:37,511
Yeah, we'll print that
story when we get it.

1954
01:36:37,650 --> 01:36:38,921
But we got to go
with this now.

1955
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:40,971
No, I'm not gonna
rush this story, Mike.

1956
01:36:41,010 --> 01:36:42,306
But we don't have a choice, Robby.

1957
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:45,901
If we don't rush to print somebody
else is gonna find this letters...

1958
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,061
and butcher the story.

1959
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:49,801
John Quinby from The Herald
was at the freaking courthouse.

1960
01:36:50,010 --> 01:36:51,601
So we'll write a holding story...

1961
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:53,191
and we'll keep our
eye on The Herald.

1962
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:54,141
- Keep our eye on The Herald?
- Yeah.

1963
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,921
If they run this and
they get it wrong...

1964
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:57,081
the Church will bury it.

1965
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:58,181
We got to do this now.

1966
01:36:58,210 --> 01:36:59,331
- Mike, Mike.

1967
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:01,031
- What? Why are we hesitating?

1968
01:37:01,290 --> 01:37:03,281
Baron told us to get Law.
This is Law.

1969
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:05,511
Baron told us to
get the system.

1970
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:07,011
We need the full scope.

1971
01:37:07,330 --> 01:37:09,451
That's the only thing that
will put an end on this.

1972
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:11,211
Then let's take it up to
Ben and let him decide.

1973
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:13,561
We'll take to Ben
when I say it's time.

1974
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:15,821
It's time, Robby! It's time!

1975
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:19,941
They knew and
they let it happen...

1976
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:22,321
to kids. Ok?

1977
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:24,121
It could have been you,
It could have been me.

1978
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:25,730
It could have
been any of us.

1979
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:28,621
We gotta nail these scumbags.

1980
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:29,811
We gotta show people...

1981
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:31,971
that nobody can
get away with this.

1982
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:35,021
Not a priest or a Cardinal,
or a freaking Pope!

1983
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:40,861
- You finished?
- Yeah, I am.

1984
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:42,891
This is bullshit!

1985
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:13,860
You ok?

1986
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:27,281
- Hi Hansi.
- Hard day at work, Mike?

1987
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:33,711
- Here.
- Thank you.

1988
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:37,831
I don't know why I got
so pissed off, you know.

1989
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:39,031
I think Robby is wrong.

1990
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:41,261
You know, you just...

1991
01:38:41,390 --> 01:38:43,110
You care about
the story, Mike. We all do.

1992
01:38:44,990 --> 01:38:46,281
Yeah, I guess.

1993
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,681
I stopped going to
Church with my nana.

1994
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:57,041
It was...It was to
hard, you know.

1995
01:38:57,170 --> 01:38:58,401
I'd be sitting
there and I...

1996
01:38:58,413 --> 01:39:00,701
I would start thinking
about Joe Crowley...

1997
01:39:00,730 --> 01:39:02,421
or someone else
and I just...

1998
01:39:02,930 --> 01:39:04,421
I just got so angry.

1999
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:07,681
Did you, did you
tell her why?

2000
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:11,161
She goes to Church
3 times a week, Mike.

2001
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:17,831
It really pisses me off.

2002
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:20,661
Yeah.

2003
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:25,571
I actually really liked going
to Church when I was a little kid.

2004
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:29,291
- Why did you stop?

2005
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:30,691
- Typical shit.

2006
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:33,981
But the weird thing is, is...

2007
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,901
I think I...

2008
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:42,001
I think I figured that
maybe one day I would...

2009
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:46,731
I would actually go back.

2010
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:50,721
I really, I was
holding on to that.

2011
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:55,261
Then I read
those letters and...

2012
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:58,461
And something's just...

2013
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:00,761
cracked.

2014
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:04,231
- It's a shitty feeling.
- Yeah.

2015
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:07,231
It's a shitty feeling.

2016
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:13,641
- Looks like a long day.
- Hey Pete.

2017
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:15,301
I'm sorry to make it longer.

2018
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:17,091
Brian...

2019
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:20,641
Does anyone ever said no
to a drink with you, Pete.

2020
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:23,151
Well sure.

2021
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:25,351
The trick is to keep asking.

2022
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:27,821
- For Boston.
- For Boston.

2023
01:40:30,970 --> 01:40:33,501
- So... You're here
for the Cardinal?

2024
01:40:33,670 --> 01:40:36,401
- No, no, no. I wouldn't.

2025
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:39,220
I wouldn't presume to speak
for the Cardinal, you know.

2026
01:40:40,751 --> 01:40:41,776
You know?

2027
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:44,561
You got a lot of people
here respect you, Robby.

2028
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:46,281
- Yeah.
- With work you do.

2029
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:48,201
- That's good to know.

2030
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:49,991
- You know, it's cause you
care about this place.

2031
01:40:50,190 --> 01:40:50,801
Yeah.

2032
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:52,771
That's why you do what
you do, that's who you are.

2033
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:55,881
You know people
need the Church.

2034
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:58,581
More than ever right now.

2035
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,891
You know, you can feel it.

2036
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:02,811
And the Cardinal...

2037
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:07,471
You know, the Cardinal,
he might not be perfect...

2038
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:10,196
But we can't throw our
other goodies doing...

2039
01:41:10,202 --> 01:41:11,721
over few bad apples.

2040
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:15,171
Now, you know I'm
bringing this up to you...

2041
01:41:15,177 --> 01:41:18,271
because I know this is
Baron's idea, his agenda.

2042
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,361
I gotta tell you,
honest to God, I mean...

2043
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:23,451
He doesn't care about
this city the way we do.

2044
01:41:24,690 --> 01:41:25,811
I mean, how could he?

2045
01:41:32,530 --> 01:41:35,641
- This is how it happens isn't it, Pete?
- What's that?

2046
01:41:35,870 --> 01:41:38,581
Guy leans on the guy
and suddenly...

2047
01:41:38,610 --> 01:41:40,841
the whole town just
looks the other way.

2048
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:44,311
Robby, Robby...

2049
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:46,621
Look it...

2050
01:41:47,570 --> 01:41:49,921
Marty Baron is just
trying to make his mark.

2051
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:51,871
He's gonna be here
for a couple of years...

2052
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:53,501
and he's gonna move on,

2053
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:55,801
just like he did in
New York and Miami.

2054
01:41:57,790 --> 01:41:59,111
Where are you gonna go?

2055
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,731
Good night, Robby. Brian.

2056
01:42:08,030 --> 01:42:10,461
- Hey Pete?
- Yeah.

2057
01:42:12,630 --> 01:42:14,551
When we do run the story,

2058
01:42:14,910 --> 01:42:17,171
I'm gonna need a comment
from the Cardinal.

2059
01:42:19,310 --> 01:42:21,871
We'll talk again later.
Good night, Robby.

2060
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:22,901
Good night, Pete.

2061
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:34,760
Robby.

2062
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:37,771
What?

2063
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:40,171
No shit. When?

2064
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,511
Ok. Yeah.

2065
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:48,770
Hey...

2066
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:50,910
What's up?

2067
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:54,381
Sweeney ruled in our favor.

2068
01:42:54,510 --> 01:42:56,581
She ruled to
unseal the documents.

2069
01:42:58,310 --> 01:42:59,310
Jesus!

2070
01:43:03,450 --> 01:43:05,041
Church has already
filed an appeal...

2071
01:43:05,070 --> 01:43:06,621
but the trial Court of ruling...

2072
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:08,621
is generally upheld
in this matters.

2073
01:43:08,810 --> 01:43:10,751
And when do we
get the documents?

2074
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,721
Probably takes common
a few weeks to rule...

2075
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:15,571
and then there's
a redaction process.

2076
01:43:16,230 --> 01:43:19,031
I'd say it would be made
public, mid January.

2077
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:21,100
- Ok.
- Alright.

2078
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:22,361
- Thanks Jon.
- You bet.

2079
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:23,890
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

2080
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:26,091
- Metro should run
something, Marty.

2081
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:28,091
- We can't run this one big.

2082
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:29,861
Why wouldn't we?

2083
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,611
It's a major
First Amendment victory.

2084
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:33,831
Not to mention you got
an Irish catholic Judge...

2085
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:35,300
ruling against the Church.

2086
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:36,851
- That's a hell of a precedent.

2087
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:39,851
- We don't want the Herald
going deep on this.

2088
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:41,701
Why is that?

2089
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:45,671
- You're gonna have
to step out, Peter.

2090
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:47,271
- I'm not stepping out.

2091
01:43:56,170 --> 01:43:57,241
Peter...

2092
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:14,041
- When did you...?
- Couple of weeks ago.

2093
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:15,361
Couple of weeks?

2094
01:44:15,450 --> 01:44:16,241
Yeah.

2095
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:18,801
- And you're telling us now?
- These are substantial.

2096
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:22,391
It clearly shows
that Law was negligent.

2097
01:44:23,230 --> 01:44:25,631
I need more time.
I wanna keep digging.

2098
01:44:25,970 --> 01:44:27,311
- For what? This is
the goddamn story.

2099
01:44:27,370 --> 01:44:28,711
It's not the whole story.

2100
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,311
Tough shit, we're on
a clock now.

2101
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:32,181
Even if we don't
run Sweeney's rulings...

2102
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:34,341
another paper could find this
letters and fuck the story.

2103
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:35,471
Agreed.

2104
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:36,831
But we run these letters alone...

2105
01:44:36,843 --> 01:44:38,761
Law apologizes, says
it's one time thing...

2106
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:40,080
and he can bury it.

2107
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:41,841
How? This clearly
show he knew...

2108
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:43,031
and did nothing about it.

2109
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:46,081
Look, I'm close
to stories on 70 priests.

2110
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:49,451
We nail that along
with those letters...

2111
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:52,141
this is proof that this
is bigger than Law.

2112
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:54,351
This is the whole system.

2113
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,841
Your multiple sources...

2114
01:44:56,850 --> 01:44:58,581
confirming all those priests?

2115
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,341
Some. I'll get more.

2116
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:02,796
Too risky. If we're
not buttoned-up...

2117
01:45:02,803 --> 01:45:05,081
on every single one of them
the Church will pick us apart.

2118
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:09,401
I think I can get us someone
from the other side of the isle.

2119
01:45:09,650 --> 01:45:11,351
- Somebody inside the Church?

2120
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:13,451
- Yeah, a lawyer.

2121
01:45:13,950 --> 01:45:15,221
- Will he go on the record?

2122
01:45:16,150 --> 01:45:18,581
Deep background,
but he's a solid source.

2123
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,581
Rezendes needs time
to write the story.

2124
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:26,091
We don't want to drop
it on Christmass...

2125
01:45:26,110 --> 01:45:27,241
not after the 9/11.

2126
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:30,681
We can run it just
after New Years.

2127
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:33,041
Before they release
the rest of the documents.

2128
01:45:36,970 --> 01:45:37,970
Alright.

2129
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:41,711
Tell Canellos to bury
the ruling in Metro.

2130
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:46,501
- You got six weeks.
- Thank you.

2131
01:45:47,850 --> 01:45:49,931
Tell Mike I want
a draft by Christmass.

2132
01:45:49,950 --> 01:45:52,631
- And we need a response
from Lake Street. - Yeah.

2133
01:45:52,650 --> 01:45:53,661
Who does PR for the Cardinal?

2134
01:45:53,770 --> 01:45:54,611
Still John Walsh?

2135
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,011
No, somebody new.
Donna Morrissey.

2136
01:45:56,110 --> 01:45:57,631
She came from TV.
She's young.

2137
01:45:57,790 --> 01:46:00,871
Good, get in quote. If we need
something from Law on...handed.

2138
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:03,101
Robby, next time give me
a goddamn heads up.

2139
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:04,370
Will do.

2140
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:08,891
<i>SPECIAL REPORT
SPOTLIGHT ARTICLE #1 - GEOGHAN LETTERS.</i>

2141
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:10,591
<i>Almost alway, his victims
were grammar school boys.</i>

2142
01:46:10,594 --> 01:46:11,896
<i>One was 4 years old.</i>

2143
01:46:20,990 --> 01:46:22,550
<i>You have 21 days and
4 hours until deadline</i>

2144
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:25,441
<i>...that Church officials
never told him why...</i>

2145
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,360
<i>You have 8 days and
2 hours until deadline</i>

2146
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:47,011
<i>...Three years later,
Geoghan was still...</i>

2147
01:46:50,834 --> 01:46:53,591
<i>Where are we on your source?
It's time. Ben</i>

2148
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:29,901
Robby, what a nice surprise.

2149
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:31,601
Come on in.

2150
01:47:38,730 --> 01:47:41,531
Hey hun... Look who
I found outside.

2151
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,211
Karen, can you
give us a minute?

2152
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:51,101
- Sure.
- Good to see you, Karen.

2153
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,481
What's up?

2154
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:11,981
I'm out of time, Jim.

2155
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:16,341
We got cover-up stories
on 70 priests.

2156
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:18,581
But the boss is
not gonna run it...

2157
01:48:18,630 --> 01:48:21,081
unless I got confirmation
from your side.

2158
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:24,951
Are you out of your mind?

2159
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:27,461
C'mon. This is
our town, Jimmy.

2160
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:29,901
Everybody knew
something was going on.

2161
01:48:30,210 --> 01:48:31,501
And no one did a thing.

2162
01:48:32,410 --> 01:48:34,171
We got to put
an end to it.

2163
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:35,921
Don't tell me
what I got to do.

2164
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:38,291
Yeah, I helped
defend this scumbags,

2165
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,031
but that's my job, Robby.

2166
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:42,031
I was doing my job!

2167
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,071
Yeah.

2168
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:47,041
You were never one of us.

2169
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:57,431
Get out of my house.

2170
01:49:08,420 --> 01:49:09,420
Hey!

2171
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:14,741
You come to my home and
lay this shit on me?

2172
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:16,511
You were right, Robby.

2173
01:49:17,030 --> 01:49:19,941
We all knew
something was going on.

2174
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:21,521
So where were you?

2175
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,221
What took you so long?

2176
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:32,191
I don't know, Jim.

2177
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:38,761
Give me the list.

2178
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:36,771
<i>Larry, we're gonna
press in 6 hours.</i>

2179
01:50:36,774 --> 01:50:39,551
Donna Morrissey says she calls
with quote from Law hours ago.

2180
01:50:39,590 --> 01:50:41,651
- That's what I thought.
- Where did you talk to her?

2181
01:50:41,870 --> 01:50:43,041
- Ok, Ok, bye.

2182
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:46,041
- Yeah, yeah that's
good to know.

2183
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:48,571
- Thanks Pete.
- Anything?

2184
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:50,875
Conley said that Donna Morrissey
should have called,

2185
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,781
he just left Lake Street.

2186
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,861
Yeah. Resky said
the same thing.

2187
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:54,878
This si ridiculous.

2188
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,375
You think they wanna
get ahead on this.

2189
01:50:56,380 --> 01:50:58,030
I mean they be
idiots not to.

2190
01:50:58,190 --> 01:51:01,701
I would love to see their faces
when they read this thing man.

2191
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:03,671
You know Sunday is the feast
to the epiphaney?

2192
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:05,330
Seems appropriate.

2193
01:51:11,770 --> 01:51:12,881
Mike Rezendes.

2194
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:15,581
Hey Donna.

2195
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:17,081
Thanks for calling.

2196
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:19,301
Yeah. I just had a few questions
if you have a minute.

2197
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:23,531
What?

2198
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:26,921
- Other adjective.

2199
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:31,061
- Anything?
- Law just turned us down.

2200
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:32,141
- Jesus Christ.

2201
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:34,041
- I just got of the phone
with Donna Morrissey...

2202
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:35,981
she said, quote
"we don't even want...

2203
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:37,211
to know what
the questions are".

2204
01:51:37,230 --> 01:51:39,071
- End quote.
- Did she really said that?

2205
01:51:39,130 --> 01:51:41,061
- Yeah.
- Well, that oughta do it.

2206
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:43,501
The Church had no
interests in knowing...

2207
01:51:43,510 --> 01:51:45,651
what the Globe's
questions would be.

2208
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:49,541
Work it in somewhere before
the jam. Anything else?

2209
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:52,501
Matt wants to put the letters
online, so that the readers...

2210
01:51:52,505 --> 01:51:53,501
can see for themselves.

2211
01:51:53,530 --> 01:51:55,961
We can run the URL at
the bottom of the article ...

2212
01:51:56,180 --> 01:51:57,861
- it's pretty straightforward.
- Ok.

2213
01:51:57,890 --> 01:52:00,021
We also put the Spotlight tip
line at the end of the story...

2214
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:01,511
so people can call in.

2215
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:02,921
It goes directly
to our office.

2216
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:04,181
Matt and I can go
in the morning...

2217
01:52:04,190 --> 01:52:05,411
in case we get any calls.

2218
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,481
I'm more concerned about
the phones at reception.

2219
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:08,911
After we ran the Porter case...

2220
01:52:08,990 --> 01:52:10,511
the message center
were tight up for weeks.

2221
01:52:10,670 --> 01:52:11,651
That's a real problem.

2222
01:52:11,670 --> 01:52:13,751
They would take at us too.
Lots of them.

2223
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:16,431
I'll talk to Richard about
the security and the phones.

2224
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:19,321
How are we coming
on the follow story?

2225
01:52:20,110 --> 01:52:22,711
Well we've now done multiple
stories on 70 priests.

2226
01:52:23,850 --> 01:52:24,951
All 70?

2227
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:27,351
And with confirmation
from Robby's source...

2228
01:52:27,370 --> 01:52:28,091
we are ready to go.

2229
01:52:28,130 --> 01:52:29,501
We can have a drive next week.

2230
01:52:29,630 --> 01:52:31,901
Robby, that source of yours,

2231
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:33,601
is it something
we could revisit?

2232
01:52:35,990 --> 01:52:36,990
It might be tough.

2233
01:52:37,130 --> 01:52:38,523
But he has no problem helping...

2234
01:52:38,530 --> 01:52:40,461
the Church protect
dozens of dirty priests.

2235
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:43,471
- Guy is a scumbag.
- He's a lawyer, he's doing his job.

2236
01:52:43,490 --> 01:52:45,821
- He's a show for the Church.
- He knew and he did nothing.

2237
01:52:45,930 --> 01:52:48,041
He could have said something
years ago. Maybe save some lives.

2238
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:49,300
What about us?

2239
01:52:51,110 --> 01:52:52,441
- What's that supposed to mean?

2240
01:52:52,510 --> 01:52:53,941
- We had all the pieces.

2241
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:56,241
- Why didn't we get it sooner?

2242
01:52:56,260 --> 01:52:57,241
- We didn't have all the pieces.

2243
01:52:57,260 --> 01:53:00,241
We had Saviano, we had Barrett,
we had Geoghan.

2244
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:02,201
We had the directories
in the basement.

2245
01:53:02,350 --> 01:53:03,541
- You know what,
we got it now.

2246
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:05,781
- Robby, this story
needed Spotlight.

2247
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:08,741
- Mike, Spotlight's been
around since 1970.

2248
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:10,701
So what? We couldn't see...

2249
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:12,101
the scope of this.
No one could.

2250
01:53:12,130 --> 01:53:14,221
Robby, this started
with one goddamn priest.

2251
01:53:17,170 --> 01:53:20,151
Macleish sent us a letter
of 20 priests years ago.

2252
01:53:20,170 --> 01:53:21,451
Sacha found a clip.

2253
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:24,211
Are you kidding, 20 priests?

2254
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:25,711
When?

2255
01:53:27,210 --> 01:53:29,611
Just after Porter,
december '93.

2256
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:32,941
I buried the story
in Metro. No follow.

2257
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:35,541
That was you?

2258
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:38,441
You were Metro?

2259
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,451
Yeah. That was me.

2260
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:44,451
I just didn't know and
I don't remember at all.

2261
01:53:46,230 --> 01:53:47,230
But yeah.

2262
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,961
Can I... Say something here?

2263
01:53:56,710 --> 01:53:58,681
Sometimes it's
easy to forget...

2264
01:53:58,690 --> 01:53:59,781
that we spend
most of our time...

2265
01:53:59,810 --> 01:54:01,791
stumbling around the dark.

2266
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:04,501
Suddenly a light
gets turned on and...

2267
01:54:04,510 --> 01:54:07,241
there's a fair share
of blame to go around.

2268
01:54:08,740 --> 01:54:10,251
I can't speak
to what happened...

2269
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:11,961
before I arrived, but...

2270
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:15,371
All of you have done some
very good reporting here.

2271
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:18,411
Reporting that I
believe is gonna have...

2272
01:54:18,450 --> 01:54:20,931
an immediate and
considerable impact...

2273
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:22,341
on our readers.

2274
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:27,741
For me... This kind of
story is why we do this.

2275
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:30,151
Having said that,
Cardinal Law and...

2276
01:54:30,155 --> 01:54:31,851
the catholic community
are gonna have ...

2277
01:54:31,858 --> 01:54:33,691
a very strong
response to this.

2278
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:38,951
So if you need a moment,
you've earned it.

2279
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:44,431
But, I will need you back here
monday morning, focused...

2280
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:46,561
and ready to do your job.

2281
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:57,771
- Leaving?
- Yeah.

2282
01:55:03,810 --> 01:55:06,631
I... just got a
call from Cardinal.

2283
01:55:06,670 --> 01:55:08,331
Really? Why?

2284
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:12,451
He wanted to tell me personally
they decided not to comment and...

2285
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:16,661
said he wanted
to extend the courtesy.

2286
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:19,721
Jesus, the balls on that guy.
What did you say?

2287
01:55:20,150 --> 01:55:23,141
I told him he was making mistake
and that we're gonna run the story.

2288
01:55:23,490 --> 01:55:25,161
Damn right we're gonna run it.

2289
01:55:50,450 --> 01:55:53,521
Sacha, can I have
a drink of water?

2290
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:55,971
Yeah, sure nana. Yeah.

2291
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:08,340
Can I keep this?

2292
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,371
Sure.

2293
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:13,371
I thought you
should see it first.

2294
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:15,131
Thank you for bringing it by.

2295
01:56:18,450 --> 01:56:20,861
Now I have some plans
I have to attend to.

2296
01:56:39,070 --> 01:56:40,521
Both kids were abused.

2297
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:42,841
Jamaica Plain two weeks ago.

2298
01:56:45,210 --> 01:56:48,851
Keep... Doing your
work, Mr. Rezendes.

2299
01:56:50,580 --> 01:56:52,391
Hello!

2300
01:56:52,810 --> 01:56:54,271
How are you guys doing?

2301
01:56:55,684 --> 01:56:57,072
Good...

2302
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:23,441
<i>Church allowed abuse
by priest for years</i>

2303
01:57:43,370 --> 01:57:45,501
- Hey.
- Good morning.

2304
01:57:46,230 --> 01:57:49,901
- How did you sleep?
- Not very well. You?

2305
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,491
I haven't slept well for months.

2306
01:57:54,170 --> 01:57:55,901
I... Actually started writing.

2307
01:57:56,530 --> 01:57:57,281
Writing?

2308
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:58,711
Yeah. I'm working on a book.

2309
01:57:58,730 --> 01:58:00,541
Gives me something
else to focus on.

2310
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:02,021
- What kind of book?

2311
01:58:02,380 --> 01:58:03,021
- Horror.

2312
01:58:10,590 --> 01:58:11,590
Spotlight?

2313
01:58:13,030 --> 01:58:14,871
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

2314
01:58:15,230 --> 01:58:16,871
Can I get your name please?

2315
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:36,401
- You do know it's sunday, right?
- Couldn't get a tee time.

2316
01:58:39,890 --> 01:58:40,901
No picketers.

2317
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:43,861
Yeah. Well they're
still at Church.

2318
01:58:46,490 --> 01:58:49,051
Hey Linda. It's quiet?

2319
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:51,441
Yeah. Easiest overtime
I ever made...

2320
01:58:51,570 --> 01:58:53,071
Phone hasn't rang once.

2321
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:55,391
Matty send two of aid
down to Spotlight.

2322
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:00,371
- Great article guys.
- Thank you.

2323
01:59:00,410 --> 01:59:02,671
- Thanks.
- Spotlight?

2324
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:30,671
Phones have been
ringing all morning.

2325
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:32,281
- That's right.
- Thank you very much.

2326
01:59:32,570 --> 01:59:33,451
Spotlight?

2327
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:35,531
- Mike, can you grab that?
- Yeah, yeah.

2328
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:38,631
They're almost all victims, Robby.

2329
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:42,120
I'm sorry...

2330
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:43,481
This is Sacha Pfeiffer.

2331
01:59:44,130 --> 01:59:45,161
I'm sorry, can I...?

2332
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:48,791
Yes you can reach me...

2333

This is Spotlight.

2334
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:07,621
This is Spotlight.

2335
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:19,331
<i>Over the course of 2002, the Spotlight team
published close to 600 stories about the scandal.</i>

2336
02:00:20,710 --> 02:00:24,540
<i>249 priests and brother were publicly accused of
sexual abuse within the Boston Archdiocese</i>

2337
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:29,421
<i>The number of survivors in Boston
is estimated to be well over 1,000.</i>

2338

<i>In December 2002, Cardinal Law resigned
from the Boston Archdiocese.</i>

2339
