2
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:23,304
When I think of my wife...

3
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:28,194
...I always think of her head.

4
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:32,556
I picture cracking her lovely skull...

5
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:34,857
Unspooling her brains...

6
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,531
Trying to get answers.

7
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:42,239
The primal questions of any marriage.

8
00:00:42,284 --> 00:00:44,624
"What are you thinking?"

9
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:46,911
"How are you feeling?"

10
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:49,585
"What have we done to each other?"

11
00:02:24,553 --> 00:02:28,563
The Irish prince
graces us with his presence.

12
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:33,355
His majesty prefers not to be moistened.

13
00:02:34,563 --> 00:02:35,853
I got you a present.

14
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,901
- I hated this game.
- You loved it.

15
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:40,232
You loved it.

16
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:42,567
Thank you.
I'll add it to the collection.

17
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,533
Can you pour me a bourbon?

18
00:02:51,788 --> 00:02:53,868
What's up, jitters?

19
00:02:57,586 --> 00:02:59,926
Well, if you're not going to talk,
I'm gonna have to fill the silence...

20
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:03,343
With another excruciating story
by margo dunne.

21
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,053
I could tell you about
my recent customer service experience...

22
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:08,104
- Changing Internet service providers.
- I like that one.

23
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:11,008
Or how about the time I saw that woman
who looked exactly like my friend Monica?

24
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,978
But it wasn't Monica.
It was a total stranger.

25
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:14,938
Who was also named Monica.

26
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,115
- Made it kind of interesting.
- It's great.

27
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,061
I'm just having a bad day.

28
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:21,067
- Amy?
- It's our anniversary.

29
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:23,069
- Five years.
- Five?

30
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:24,281
That came fast.

31
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:25,651
And furious.

32
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:33,292
I'm so crazy, stupid happy.

33
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:37,584
I met a boy.

34
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:42,056
A great, sweet, gorgeous, cool-ass guy.

35
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:45,589
Excuse me, miss?

36
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,094
I just want you to be careful...

37
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:49,935
Where you put down that
monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...

38
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:52,681
Because the party's down to three
beast lights and a bottle of pucker.

39
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:54,434
It might attract
some desperate characters.

40
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:57,316
It could.
I mean, the amish are on a rumspringa.

41
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,940
They already relieved me
of my artisanal meat platter.

42
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:06,865
Finally, someone tells me
how to pronounce that word.

43
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:07,905
"Meat"?

44
00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:09,156
Yes, "meat." One syllable.

45
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:12,161
Thank you. Whose beer am I
about to drink?

46
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:13,492
Don't tell me.

47
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:15,832
Let's see, who's your type?

48
00:04:16,248 --> 00:04:17,328
I don't see you sitting quietly...

49
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:20,964
While he bloviates
on his postgrad thesis about proust.

50
00:04:21,003 --> 00:04:23,303
Uh-oh. Is that him?

51
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:25,619
Ironic hipster, so self-aware,
he makes everything a joke.

52
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:28,841
I prefer men who are funny, not "funny."

53
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:32,009
What type are you?

54
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,515
Corn-fed,
salt-of-the-earth Missouri guy.

55
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:34,677
Missouri?

56
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:35,645
Cute.

57
00:04:35,684 --> 00:04:38,024
- Native new yorker?
- The world ends at the Hudson.

58
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:39,141
What's your name?

59
00:04:39,187 --> 00:04:40,187
Amy.

60
00:04:40,188 --> 00:04:42,518
Well, Amy, who are you?

61
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:47,029
A, I'm an award-winning scrimshander.

62
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,240
B, I'm a moderately influential warlord.

63
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:54,413
C, I write personality quizzes
for magazines.

64
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:58,996
Okay. Your hands are far too delicate
for real scrimshaw work...

65
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,291
And I happen to be a charter subscriber
to middling warlord weekly...

66
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,546
So I'd recognize you.

67
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,209
I'm gonna go with "c."

68
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:06,675
And you?

69
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,047
Who are you?

70
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:13,432
I'm the guy to save you
from all this awesomeness.

71
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,347
So, you write for a men's magazine.

72
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:23,655
God, does that make you an expert
on being a man?

73
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,770
No.

74
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:26,887
It's what to wear, what to drink.

75
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:28,862
How to bullshit.

76
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:30,494
Never with you.

77
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,360
Ha, ha.

78
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:33,026
No, I mean it.

79
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:34,875
It's hard to believe you.

80
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:35,700
Why?

81
00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:37,374
I think it's your chin.

82
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:38,542
My chin?

83
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,250
Yeah, it's quite villainous.

84
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,921
Okay, how's this?

85
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,089
A hundred percent true, no bullshit.

86
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:48,464
Okay.

87
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:50,055
We all move to New York...

88
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:54,222
And we end up living in these little
cubby holes, and that's not it.

89
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:57,722
Come outside. Then, you're in it.

90
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:01,893
You have to see this.

91
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:11,535
Hey.

92
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,571
Hey.

93
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,290
I have to kiss you now.

94
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,753
Is that right?

95
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:27,963
I can't let you go through
a sugar storm unkissed.

96
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:30,958
Wait a second.

97
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:35,137
There you go.

98
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:48,485
Nick dunne...

99
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,325
I really like you.

100
00:06:58,493 --> 00:07:00,743
So, is Amy gonna do
one of those anniversary...

101
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:03,005
Treasure hunts?

102
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,040
You mean the forced march
designed to prove...

103
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,043
What an oblivious and uncaring asshole
her husband is?

104
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:09,166
Wow.

105
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,717
Life. I don't remember the point.

106
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,969
Deep hasbro thoughts.

107
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:17,341
Spin.

108
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,390
What was the clue last year
she got so mad about?

109
00:07:20,432 --> 00:07:23,732
"When your poor Amy has a cold...

110
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,479
"This dessert just must be sold."

111
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
The answer?

112
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:28,311
I still don't know the answer, go.

113
00:07:28,357 --> 00:07:30,517
- A few years ago, you'd have known.
- A few years ago, it was fun.

114
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,227
Year one,
the traditional gift was paper.

115
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:35,737
She got me a beautiful notebook.
Told me to go write my novel.

116
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:36,661
What did you get her?

117
00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:38,068
A kite.

118
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:39,946
- She'd never flown a kite.
- Okay.

119
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:43,501
Anyway. Year four, flowers.

120
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:46,788
She led me outside
to the dying rosebush in the backyard.

121
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,175
That's symbolic.

122
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,210
Yeah.

123
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:50,671
What's the gift for five?

124
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:51,502
Wood.

125
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:54,006
- So, what did you get her?
- There's no good gift for wood.

126
00:07:54,049 --> 00:07:57,379
I know! Go home, fuck her brains out,
slap her with your penis.

127
00:07:57,427 --> 00:07:58,887
"There's some wood for you, bitch."

128
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:03,722
The bar.

129
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:06,896
Why, yes. Hang on one second.

130
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:08,097
Hey, it's watchful Wally.

131
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,399
Hey, Walt. What's going on?

132
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:17,858
Thanks very much. I'll be right there.
All right, bye-bye.

133
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:32,755
Hey, buddy. What are you doing out here?

134
00:08:33,964 --> 00:08:35,464
Thanks, Walt!

135
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:52,518
Ame?

136
00:09:12,878 --> 00:09:14,338
Amy!

137
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:28,017
Hello?

138
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:29,645
Come on in.

139
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:31,195
Hey.

140
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:32,649
- Mister dunne.
- Hi.

141
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:35,189
I'm detective Rhonda boney.
This is officer James gilpin.

142
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:37,193
We understand there are concerns
about your wife.

143
00:09:37,235 --> 00:09:41,155
I don't know where my wife is.
And I came home to this.

144
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:44,989
Now, I don't panic easily...

145
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:47,407
But it's weird, right?

146
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:49,664
Mind if we look around?

147
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:50,835
Please.

148
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:52,154
How long have you two been here?

149
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:54,997
Two years in September.
We used to live in New York.

150
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,135
City?

151
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:59,301
Yeah, I was a writer.
We were both writers.

152
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:00,971
Why did you all move back here?

153
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:02,629
My mom got sick.

154
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:05,638
Oh, I'm sorry. How is she?

155
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:07,141
She's dead.

156
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:08,182
I'm so sorry.

157
00:10:13,897 --> 00:10:16,187
What do you do now, for work?

158
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:18,897
My sister margo and I
own the bar downtown.

159
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:21,201
Oh, the bar.

160
00:10:21,238 --> 00:10:23,488
Love the name. Very meta.

161
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:24,622
Thanks.

162
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:29,367
Pretty things.

163
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:35,466
Stay.

164
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,252
My office, here.

165
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:42,338
Beautiful dress.

166
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,136
Date night?

167
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,430
It's our anniversary.

168
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:53,101
It's a guest bedroom, there.

169
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:55,025
Cat's room on the end.

170
00:10:55,063 --> 00:10:56,613
I checked up here.

171
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,076
This is the kitchen...

172
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:03,452
Obviously.

173
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,052
This is my wife's office.

174
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:22,709
Amy's office.

175
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:38,811
Wow. Impressive gal.

176
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:40,067
Yeah. Should I be concerned?

177
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:41,278
I remember these.

178
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:43,777
I loved these books.

179
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:49,369
Wait a minute.

180
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,409
Your wife is amazing Amy?

181
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:54,335
Yeah. She is.

182
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:56,003
Wow.

183
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:02,632
Amazing-fucking-Amy
is getting fucking married.

184
00:12:02,673 --> 00:12:04,463
That's how the night started.

185
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:10,598
With me, regular, flawed, real Amy,
jealous, as always, of the golden child.

186
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,229
Perfect, brilliant, amazing Amy,
who's getting fucking married.

187
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,350
When I was 10, I quit cello.

188
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:20,986
In the next book,
amazing Amy became a prodigy.

189
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,443
Did you play volleyball?

190
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:26,366
I got cut, freshman year.

191
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:28,325
She made varsity.

192
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:31,741
When did you have a dog?

193
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:32,785
She got the dog.

194
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:35,912
Puddles made her more relatable.

195
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,296
Wow.

196
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:39,462
I love your parents...

197
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:41,291
But they really can be assholes.

198
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:42,786
- Nick!
- Sir!

199
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:44,628
Hey, thanks for coming, man.

200
00:12:44,673 --> 00:12:45,463
No problem.

201
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:46,917
Hey, sweetheart.

202
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:48,929
Big night for your mom.

203
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:52,799
It would mean so much
if you would talk to a few reporters...

204
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:54,718
Bloggers, give them a little Amy color.

205
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:56,636
People wanna hear from you.

206
00:12:56,685 --> 00:12:58,315
- We can't stay long.
- Fantastic.

207
00:12:58,353 --> 00:13:00,523
Fifteen minutes, tops.

208
00:13:00,856 --> 00:13:05,156
This is why I have my brownstone.
My trust fund. I know I can't complain.

209
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:07,823
Your parents literally
plagiarized your childhood.

210
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:11,913
No, they improved upon it,
and then peddled it to the masses.

211
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,160
I thought you were gonna wear white
to match the wedding theme.

212
00:13:14,202 --> 00:13:15,662
I thought that would be creepy.

213
00:13:15,704 --> 00:13:18,164
"If it's worth doing,
it's worth doing..."

214
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:20,536
hold up! I know how this ends.
Don't tell me.

215
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:22,384
You're very cute, Nick.

216
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:24,059
Amy, you know
what would make dad's night.

217
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:25,707
I'm on it.

218
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:30,007
I love having strangers
pick at my scabs.

219
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:31,302
I'm curious whether...

220
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:33,055
It's difficult for you to see
amazing Amy heading down the aisle.

221
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,520
And this big party
celebrating this fictional wedding.

222
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:38,888
Because it's my understanding
you are not married.

223
00:13:38,935 --> 00:13:40,605
Is that correct?

224
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:45,323
Correct. Amazing Amy has always been
one step ahead of me.

225
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:49,189
Excuse me. I'm sorry,
I just have a few questions.

226
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:50,491
It's you.

227
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,070
I'm here in a
strictly journalistic capacity.

228
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:56,697
Now, you had the distinct pleasure
of dating Nick dunne for how long?

229
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:59,545
- Two magical years.
- Two magical years.

230
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:01,421
In the course of that time,
you've had the opportunity...

231
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,918
To perform such gracious gestures as...

232
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,880
Not correcting Nick when he
pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."

233
00:14:07,923 --> 00:14:09,383
An understandable mistake.

234
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:10,624
He also thought it was a fish.

235
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:12,224
He thinks velveeta is a cheese.

236
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:15,551
You also manage to appear
shocked and delighted...

237
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:18,177
When Nick's elderly mother
breaks into an impromptu rendition...

238
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,435
Of New York, New York,
every time she sees you.

239
00:14:20,477 --> 00:14:22,517
[S]These bag of bone shoes

240
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:23,732
that's just frightening.

241
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:26,402
You also bought Nick
his very first pair of scissors.

242
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:28,111
And matching stapler.

243
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:31,071
Amy elliott, you are more than amazing.

244
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:34,623
You are brilliant,
yet entirely un-snobby.

245
00:14:34,658 --> 00:14:38,288
You challenge me. You surprise me.

246
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:39,658
And, fun fact for the readers...

247
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,790
You have a world-class vagina.

248
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,924
My colleagues tell me
that you are not yet married.

249
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:49,252
Is that correct?

250
00:14:49,297 --> 00:14:50,757
I'm not.

251
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,129
Isn't it time we fixed that?

252
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,263
And then...

253
00:14:55,303 --> 00:14:58,143
The night wasn't so bad anymore.

254
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:16,989
And it's done. Crossed off the list.

255
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:20,994
Now, normally, we would not treat this
as a missing persons case so quick...

256
00:15:21,038 --> 00:15:22,478
But given the scene at your house...

257
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:24,617
And given our spike
in violent crime of late...

258
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,126
We are gonna take this
very, very seriously.

259
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:28,169
Okay. Good.

260
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,460
We've got forensics over at your place.
You got somewhere to stay?

261
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:33,086
- I could stay at my sister's.
- Okay.

262
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,433
We're tracking Amy's phone,
her credit cards.

263
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,139
We will organize searches,
put up flyers.

264
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:40,179
- We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.
- You're having a press conference?

265
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:41,813
I wanna get the word out, right?

266
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,140
Yeah, it's just all of a sudden,
I feel like I'm on a law & order episode.

267
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:56,366
Time is of the essence in these cases.

268
00:15:56,406 --> 00:15:59,156
But, that said,
do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?

269
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:00,331
Absolutely not. I just wanna help.

270
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:02,159
So, you and Amy
have been here two years.

271
00:16:02,204 --> 00:16:05,464
- You tend bar...
- I own the bar.

272
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:08,999
And I teach creative writing at mvcc.

273
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:10,844
- No kids?
- Not yet.

274
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,339
So, what does Amy do most days?

275
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:14,591
A woman with all those degrees,
what does she do?

276
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:16,512
I don't know. She keeps busy.

277
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:18,051
Doing what?

278
00:16:20,263 --> 00:16:21,893
She's a voracious reader.

279
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:24,772
So, she's always got a book in her hand.

280
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,312
Well, days can get long.

281
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:31,194
I know a few housewives, that evening
glass of wine starts coming at noon.

282
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:32,523
Or prescription pills.

283
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,067
Just last week, we had a soccer mom.

284
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:36,571
Nice lady. Got her teeth kicked in
over some oxycontin.

285
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:38,703
Ever since that mall went bust,
half the town is out of work.

286
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,240
We cannot keep up
with the drug violence.

287
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:42,703
I'm pretty sure that's not it.

288
00:16:42,744 --> 00:16:44,584
Has Amy got friends we can talk to?

289
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:47,871
No, not really.

290
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,876
No friends? This whole town?

291
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:53,548
She was very close with my mom,
before she passed away.

292
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:55,708
You know, we have a pretty serious
homeless problem...

293
00:16:55,757 --> 00:16:56,877
In our neighborhood.

294
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,977
I think maybe you guys
should check that out.

295
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:01,262
We'll look into that.

296
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:03,934
You got to the bar around 11:00 today.

297
00:17:03,974 --> 00:17:05,564
Where were you before that?
Just to cross that out.

298
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Well, I was home.

299
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:09,231
I left at 9:30,
I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.

300
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:10,901
I went to Sawyer beach
and read the news.

301
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:13,109
Did you visit with anyone there?

302
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,110
I kind of go to Sawyer beach
for the solitude.

303
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:18,858
So, your wife has no friends here.

304
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,745
Is she kinda standoffish?

305
00:17:20,782 --> 00:17:23,202
Ivy league? Rubs people the wrong way?

306
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,743
She's from New York.

307
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:29,252
She's complicated.
She's got very high standards.

308
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,291
Type a?

309
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:33,039
That can make you crazy
if you're not like that.

310
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,916
You seem pretty laid-back. Type b.

311
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:38,134
Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?

312
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:40,475
God, I don't know.
I'd have to look it up at the house.

313
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,300
You don't know if she has friends,
you don't know what she does all day...

314
00:17:43,347 --> 00:17:45,257
And you don't know
your wife's blood type.

315
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:46,427
Sure you all are married?

316
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:49,185
Maybe it's type o.

317
00:17:49,186 --> 00:17:51,406
- Where are her folks? New York?
- Yeah.

318
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,148
Can they get here time
for this press conference tomorrow?

319
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,230
Tomorrow? I have no idea.
I haven't talked to them.

320
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,115
You haven't called
your wife's parents yet?

321
00:17:57,152 --> 00:17:59,572
You can't get a signal in this building.
I've been in here talking to you.

322
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:02,073
Call them, please, Nick. Now.

323
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,325
Fine.

324
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,790
Should I know my wife's blood type?

325
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:11,832
No.

326
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:15,957
I apologize, marybeth.
I didn't know what was going on.

327
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:17,504
Now I'm at the station...

328
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:21,047
And the cops are at the house,
and it's serious and I'm calling you.

329
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,720
There's a lot of things
that are being juggled right now.

330
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:28,023
I'm standing right next to
detective Rhonda boney...

331
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:30,018
Who's the lead investigator on this
and she's...

332
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,440
My mother-in-law
would like to speak with you.

333
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:37,147
This is detective boney.

334
00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:38,532
I wanna go home.

335
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:41,028
I don't know why I have to be here.

336
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:43,701
I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home.

337
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,870
Dad?

338
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:46,873
This is my father. What's going on?

339
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:47,950
Really? You're Nick dunne?

340
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:50,203
We've been trying to get a hold of you
all afternoon.

341
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:51,907
I've been right there.
My wife is missing.

342
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:53,077
- Bitch.
- Don't.

343
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,505
Your father wandered out of comfort hill
after lunch.

344
00:18:55,544 --> 00:18:57,924
We found him walking route 79,
disoriented.

345
00:18:57,963 --> 00:18:59,423
We've been trying to call you
for the last...

346
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:00,714
I don't get a cell signal
in this building.

347
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:02,717
I've been sitting
20 feet away from you.

348
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:04,681
Sir, please
don't take that tone with me.

349
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,840
Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.

350
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:07,427
Dad, stop.

351
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,310
You wanna drive him home?

352
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:14,267
I think that would be wise. Thanks.

353
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:36,922
This voice mailbox is currently full.

354
00:19:37,836 --> 00:19:38,836
Fuck.

355
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:43,554
Get your fucking hands off me.

356
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:44,972
Thanks.

357
00:19:57,773 --> 00:20:01,943
Everyone told us
and told us and told us...

358
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:04,575
Marriage is hard work.

359
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:07,663
And compromise and more work.

360
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:09,949
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter."

361
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:12,913
"When young Amy's hope did wane...

362
00:20:12,954 --> 00:20:14,294
"She wandered here..."

363
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:16,831
Well, it's not true.
Not for me and Nick.

364
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,505
"...in search of Jane."

365
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:22,464
With us, two years...

366
00:20:22,714 --> 00:20:24,134
It's just good.

367
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:26,473
Austen.

368
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:31,969
You were an alienated teen
and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you.

369
00:20:32,474 --> 00:20:34,474
Look at that.

370
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:37,691
My God.

371
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:39,478
You naughty minx.

372
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:42,613
Well, technically, we are supposed
to fuck at the next stop.

373
00:20:42,651 --> 00:20:44,281
Yeah, in keeping with tradition.

374
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,819
But I might be willing
to bend the rules this once.

375
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:49,574
God bless Jane Austen.

376
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:08,933
I'm enthusiastic. Look at that.
It's confirmed by the...

377
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:14,178
Thank you.

378
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:16,685
Year two. Cotton.

379
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:27,692
We had that joke that our sex
was too good for ordinary.

380
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:30,198
So, these are 2,000 thread-count...

381
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:38,165
we're so cute.
I wanna punch us in the face.

382
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:41,416
That's pretty great.
I mean, that is pretty great.

383
00:21:42,878 --> 00:21:44,338
Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer?

384
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:46,549
I don't need a lawyer.
Here, I'll do this.

385
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:49,009
Well, did they ask personal stuff
about Amy?

386
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:50,221
You know, they asked...

387
00:21:50,552 --> 00:21:52,012
Why didn't she have any friends?

388
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:52,894
What did you say?

389
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:54,929
- I said she was complicated.
- Nick!

390
00:21:55,932 --> 00:21:58,562
Everyone knows "complicated"
is code for "bitch."

391
00:22:03,982 --> 00:22:05,772
God. I feel sick.

392
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:07,227
Thanks.

393
00:22:08,236 --> 00:22:09,526
It's so bizarre.

394
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:12,071
It seems like the kind of thing
that would happen to Amy.

395
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:13,285
She always attracts...

396
00:22:13,325 --> 00:22:14,915
Drama?

397
00:22:15,744 --> 00:22:17,124
You can say it. It's just me and you.

398
00:22:17,162 --> 00:22:19,712
Just because
I don't like to be around Amy...

399
00:22:19,748 --> 00:22:21,188
Doesn't mean I don't care about her.

400
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:26,256
Anyway, whoever took her
is bound to bring her back.

401
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:37,637
Detective? Excuse me.

402
00:22:37,683 --> 00:22:40,313
I'm noelle hawthorne.
I'm Amy's best friend.

403
00:22:41,436 --> 00:22:44,096
Well, great. Where do you live, noelle?

404
00:22:44,648 --> 00:22:46,148
Five doors down. 1032.

405
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:48,401
Wonderful. I would love to talk to you.

406
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:50,323
Can I come by in half an hour?

407
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:52,072
- Y'all know anything yet?
- I'm sorry.

408
00:22:52,114 --> 00:22:54,914
I got guys on the clock in here.
But you give me 30 minutes.

409
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,280
But that's usually bath time.

410
00:22:57,035 --> 00:22:59,625
Well, we'll talk in between shampoos.

411
00:23:02,374 --> 00:23:03,674
All right. So, what do you got?

412
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:06,339
It was definitely blood spatter
you saw in the kitchen.

413
00:23:06,837 --> 00:23:08,497
Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep.

414
00:23:08,547 --> 00:23:10,917
Not that weird,
but that is awfully high.

415
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:12,596
So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep.

416
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:13,804
Well, okay.

417
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:17,603
Interesting.

418
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:18,759
What's that?

419
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:22,307
House is rented in her name.
Car's in her name.

420
00:23:22,352 --> 00:23:25,482
Credit cards, utilities,
phone bill, all in her name.

421
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:27,362
Even his bar's in her name.

422
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:29,319
I don't know that that's so surprising.

423
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,979
No. But it is humiliating.

424
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:31,938
What you got?

425
00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:34,817
It's with her unmentionables.

426
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:50,049
Well, we have our first clue.

427
00:24:01,141 --> 00:24:02,811
I have to take a shower.

428
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:04,641
No, don't. You've been up all night.

429
00:24:04,686 --> 00:24:06,846
You wanna look
like you've been up all night.

430
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:10,822
Hey, be careful today, okay?

431
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:12,189
That's a weird thing to say.

432
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:15,995
Well, when you're upset, you bottle up.
You can seem angry, like...

433
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:17,531
please don't say, "like dad."

434
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:20,334
Or else you swing into your momma's-boy
charm offensive and that can feel glib.

435
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:21,159
Perfect.

436
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:23,953
I'll balance on the exact fucking edge
of your emotional razor.

437
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:25,827
Okay. Just be...

438
00:24:25,874 --> 00:24:27,794
Myself?

439
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:30,174
...sponsoring a raffle to
benefit west county 4h...

440
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:33,672
And raffling season tickets for
mizzou football.

441
00:24:33,715 --> 00:24:37,015
Buy your tickets at the wing hut or
local tri-state tire stores.

442
00:24:41,598 --> 00:24:42,928
Your in-laws made it.

443
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:45,985
- Hi, rand.
- Hey, man.

444
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:46,849
I'm detective boney.

445
00:24:46,895 --> 00:24:48,855
I'm the twin. Margo.

446
00:24:48,897 --> 00:24:51,977
We played tennis yesterday, Nick.
I just can't get over it.

447
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:53,365
Marybeth, I am really sorry.

448
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:55,192
I knew you never should have
moved back here.

449
00:24:55,237 --> 00:24:56,357
We didn't have a lot of choice.

450
00:24:56,405 --> 00:25:00,075
We are all worried. We are all scared.

451
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:04,577
But we are all here now.
And we will find Amy, together.

452
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:16,718
Should I just go first, and then
you guys can say something?

453
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:17,758
Good.

454
00:25:19,386 --> 00:25:23,726
As you know, my wife,
Amy elliott dunne...

455
00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:26,565
Disappeared from our home
on the morning of July 5th...

456
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,059
Under suspicious circumstances.

457
00:25:30,105 --> 00:25:31,565
Louder!

458
00:25:31,606 --> 00:25:36,026
If anyone out there
has any information...

459
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:38,399
Please come forward.

460
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:40,067
Thank you.

461
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:45,239
I'm rand elliott.
My wife, marybeth elliott.

462
00:25:45,287 --> 00:25:46,367
Should I have said my name?

463
00:25:46,955 --> 00:25:48,915
Amy is our only child.

464
00:25:48,957 --> 00:25:52,957
She's bright, she's beautiful.
She's kind.

465
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:54,962
She really is amazing Amy.

466
00:25:55,297 --> 00:25:58,007
You know, there are
millions of people out there...

467
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,590
Who grew up with her and care about her.

468
00:26:00,635 --> 00:26:03,265
We care about her, we love her.

469
00:26:03,972 --> 00:26:06,562
And we just want her back.

470
00:26:08,477 --> 00:26:11,097
Amy is a decorated scholar.

471
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:14,116
She forged a successful career
in journalism.

472
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:16,439
She returned here
to her husband's hometown...

473
00:26:16,485 --> 00:26:18,825
And she made a life in her adopted home.

474
00:26:19,905 --> 00:26:22,285
Now, Amy needs your help.

475
00:26:22,324 --> 00:26:26,454
We're establishing a volunteer
headquarters at the drury lodge.

476
00:26:26,495 --> 00:26:31,835
We have a hotline, 1-855-4-Amy-tips.

477
00:26:32,084 --> 00:26:37,504
And our website is
www.Findamazingamy.Com.

478
00:26:38,006 --> 00:26:39,966
- Mr. dunne!
- Mr. elliott!

479
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:43,183
Mr. dunne, any signs of foul play?

480
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,600
Mr. elliott, when was the last time
you spoke to your daughter?

481
00:26:50,102 --> 00:26:51,102
Smile.

482
00:26:57,693 --> 00:26:59,283
That's all for now. Thank you.

483
00:27:01,863 --> 00:27:04,703
Amy is the kind of girl
who attracts admirers.

484
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:05,621
Right, Nick?

485
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:06,829
Yeah, definitely.

486
00:27:06,868 --> 00:27:09,368
And we've had instances...

487
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:11,463
- Where things got...
- scary.

488
00:27:11,498 --> 00:27:12,958
Do you know about desi collings?

489
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,670
Yeah, I know all about desi collings.

490
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,960
He was obsessed.

491
00:27:16,003 --> 00:27:19,343
He attempted suicide after Amy
broke up with him sophomore year.

492
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:20,921
We had to file a restraining order.

493
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:23,346
This would be high school?
Twenty years ago?

494
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:26,605
But he recently moved to St. Louis.
That's just two hours away.

495
00:27:26,638 --> 00:27:28,508
To be fair, he is from St. Louis.

496
00:27:28,557 --> 00:27:30,177
We also have Tommy O'Hara.

497
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:32,435
This is only eight years ago,
in New York.

498
00:27:32,477 --> 00:27:34,767
She broke up with him,
he got very physical.

499
00:27:34,813 --> 00:27:36,493
- She filed charges.
- What was the charge?

500
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:38,613
Sexual assault, threat, battery, what?

501
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,610
I only know it was bad.

502
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:42,442
- I didn't know this.
- Okay.

503
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:44,397
Thank you.

504
00:27:44,448 --> 00:27:45,738
Anything more recent?

505
00:27:49,077 --> 00:27:51,077
Not that I know of.

506
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,460
Hey, Nick? You got a minute?

507
00:27:57,627 --> 00:27:59,247
Yeah.

508
00:28:04,634 --> 00:28:06,014
Imagine our confusion.

509
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:07,223
A missing persons case...

510
00:28:07,262 --> 00:28:09,852
And in your wife's dressing room,
we find an envelope marked "clue."

511
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,140
That's for our anniversary.

512
00:28:12,184 --> 00:28:14,484
My wife does these treasure hunts.

513
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,899
I'm hoping you can tell me
what this means.

514
00:28:16,938 --> 00:28:17,938
You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt?

515
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:20,677
It'll help me track Amy's movements
before she disappeared.

516
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,071
Of course. Okay.

517
00:28:23,111 --> 00:28:25,701
"Although this spot
couldn't be tighter...

518
00:28:26,448 --> 00:28:29,158
"It's a cozy room
for my favorite writer."

519
00:28:31,995 --> 00:28:33,205
I know this one!

520
00:28:33,705 --> 00:28:37,215
Although this spot
couldn't be any tighter...

521
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:40,634
It's a cozy room for my favorite writer.

522
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,550
After-school meeting,
don't mind if I do.

523
00:28:45,592 --> 00:28:48,512
Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two.

524
00:28:52,557 --> 00:28:54,887
Well, well. What does it say?

525
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:56,445
Clue two.

526
00:28:57,562 --> 00:29:00,942
"Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover.

527
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:05,321
"You'll be the spy,
and I'll be his lover.

528
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:06,861
"Let's head on over...

529
00:29:06,905 --> 00:29:08,785
"To the little brown house.

530
00:29:08,824 --> 00:29:12,534
"We'll play hot, doting husband,
sweet, loving spouse."

531
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,580
These yours?

532
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:18,207
No.

533
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,710
But you read the first clue.

534
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:22,881
Randy Professor, naughty student.

535
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:23,961
I blush.

536
00:29:24,006 --> 00:29:25,766
Me and my ex just swapped cards.

537
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:28,337
Where's this little brown house?

538
00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:29,895
I have no idea.

539
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:14,466
Hello?

540
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,020
Nicholas dunne.

541
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:20,774
Under my father's name, William dunne.

542
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:31,284
My wife's first pet? Is this necessary?
Can you just turn the bell...

543
00:30:31,323 --> 00:30:32,323
yeah, I know.

544
00:30:32,324 --> 00:30:33,954
It's... it's...

545
00:30:36,411 --> 00:30:38,701
It's "puddles," right?
Or is it "poodles?"

546
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:44,256
We're good.

547
00:30:45,837 --> 00:30:46,957
Hello, stranger.

548
00:30:47,005 --> 00:30:49,135
Fancy meeting you here.

549
00:30:49,174 --> 00:30:51,474
It's your dad's house, right?

550
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,140
Are you following me?

551
00:30:53,178 --> 00:30:54,048
What you doing?

552
00:30:54,096 --> 00:30:56,266
Like you said, it's my dad's house.

553
00:30:56,306 --> 00:30:59,016
I come by once a week,
make sure the place hasn't burned down.

554
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:02,101
But it looks okay.

555
00:31:02,854 --> 00:31:04,734
I'll walk you out.

556
00:31:07,984 --> 00:31:09,484
You know...

557
00:31:09,528 --> 00:31:12,778
I thought maybe
this was the little brown house.

558
00:31:12,823 --> 00:31:14,033
From the clue.

559
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:16,034
Nope. Still blue.

560
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:36,719
Picture me,
I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

561
00:31:36,763 --> 00:31:40,473
I need to be punished,
and by "punished," I mean "had."

562
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:44,106
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.

563
00:31:44,396 --> 00:31:48,156
"So open the door, and look alive."

564
00:31:49,443 --> 00:31:50,483
Bitch!

565
00:31:54,197 --> 00:31:57,197
Want to test your marriage
for weak spots?

566
00:31:57,868 --> 00:31:59,328
Add one recession...

567
00:31:59,661 --> 00:32:00,951
Subtract two jobs.

568
00:32:01,538 --> 00:32:03,658
It's surprisingly effective.

569
00:32:03,707 --> 00:32:06,117
Promise me we'll never be like them.

570
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:07,288
Like who?

571
00:32:07,336 --> 00:32:09,096
All those awful couples we know.

572
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:13,089
Those wives who treat their men
like dancing monkeys...

573
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:14,593
To be trained and paraded.

574
00:32:15,218 --> 00:32:17,928
Husbands who treat their wives
like the highway patrol...

575
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:20,895
To be out-foxed and avoided.

576
00:32:25,645 --> 00:32:27,315
I think I'm gonna be laid off.

577
00:32:28,106 --> 00:32:30,896
We're in a recession.
If it happens, we'll deal with it.

578
00:32:30,942 --> 00:32:33,152
I'll probably be next.

579
00:32:33,195 --> 00:32:34,445
We have each other.

580
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:37,361
Everything else is background noise.

581
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,240
You are exceptional.

582
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:49,209
My turn.

583
00:32:51,088 --> 00:32:54,548
My parents' publisher dropped them,
and they're in debt up to their ears.

584
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:55,421
That's terrible.

585
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:57,887
And they need to borrow
from my trust fund.

586
00:32:57,928 --> 00:32:59,428
How much?

587
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:01,681
Almost a million.

588
00:33:02,265 --> 00:33:03,855
That's almost all of it.

589
00:33:03,892 --> 00:33:06,192
This is where you say,
"everything else is background noise."

590
00:33:06,228 --> 00:33:07,268
Amy, if you're laid off...

591
00:33:07,437 --> 00:33:08,687
And I'm laid off...

592
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,860
I said I'd do it.

593
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:11,148
Without talking to me?

594
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:12,771
- Well, it's...
- Your call.

595
00:33:12,818 --> 00:33:14,398
...their money, technically.

596
00:33:18,824 --> 00:33:20,494
You know what? You're right.

597
00:33:21,118 --> 00:33:23,118
Everything else
is just background noise.

598
00:33:32,087 --> 00:33:33,087
Hey.

599
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:38,377
More games?

600
00:33:38,427 --> 00:33:40,047
Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks.

601
00:33:41,263 --> 00:33:42,723
What's the laptop for?

602
00:33:43,807 --> 00:33:44,807
Laptop-ing.

603
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,980
I see.

604
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,020
You can give your parents $879,000
without talking to me...

605
00:33:51,565 --> 00:33:54,195
But God forbid I buy a video game
without getting your permission.

606
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:55,284
You are spending a lot.

607
00:33:55,318 --> 00:33:57,568
You don't trust me.
You don't trust my judgment.

608
00:33:57,612 --> 00:33:59,172
You certainly don't trust my intention.

609
00:33:59,197 --> 00:34:00,157
What are you talking about?

610
00:34:00,198 --> 00:34:01,818
That's the basic tenet
of a prenup, isn't it?

611
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:04,117
Why are you throwing that
in my face again?

612
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:05,701
Because it's easy to throw.

613
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:06,546
Nick, I don't get it.

614
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,920
I don't get why you're daring me
to be someone I don't wanna be.

615
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:13,038
The nagging shrew.
The controlling bitch.

616
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:15,456
I'm not that person. I'm your wife.

617
00:34:15,505 --> 00:34:16,675
I'm sorry.

618
00:34:16,715 --> 00:34:19,055
I just don't know how to do this.
I've never not had a job.

619
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:21,092
I flipped burgers, I painted houses.

620
00:34:21,136 --> 00:34:23,146
You'll get another job.

621
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:28,769
Hi, go.

622
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,270
What? Hold on. What?

623
00:34:32,314 --> 00:34:33,734
- And suddenly...
- Slow down, what is it?

624
00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:35,774
...I knew everything
was about to get worse.

625
00:34:35,817 --> 00:34:37,397
Okay, tell me what's wrong.

626
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:06,263
- Bless you, Nick.
- Father.

627
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:08,352
Hey, tom. Mayor!

628
00:35:08,392 --> 00:35:09,642
Nick, good to see you.

629
00:35:09,685 --> 00:35:10,685
Good to see you.

630
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:11,977
Hey, guys, hey.

631
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:15,898
- Jodie.
- Nick.

632
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:19,229
Oh, we'll find her.

633
00:35:34,209 --> 00:35:35,919
You look like hammered shit.

634
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:37,631
Thank you.

635
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:47,441
You ever see that guy
in the glasses before?

636
00:35:48,098 --> 00:35:50,848
Don't worry. We videotape everybody
that comes in and out of these things.

637
00:35:50,892 --> 00:35:52,682
I mean, you tend to get a lot of...

638
00:35:52,728 --> 00:35:53,768
Do-gooders?

639
00:35:53,812 --> 00:35:55,022
Freaks.

640
00:35:55,063 --> 00:35:57,023
Hey, I meant to ask you.

641
00:35:57,065 --> 00:35:58,525
Noelle hawthorne?

642
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:01,121
She lives on your street.
Amy's best friend.

643
00:36:02,237 --> 00:36:03,567
I've never heard the name
noelle hawthorne.

644
00:36:03,613 --> 00:36:05,783
She and her husband have triplets.

645
00:36:05,824 --> 00:36:06,824
Oh.

646
00:36:07,117 --> 00:36:09,947
Yeah, we might say hi to them
on the street.

647
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:12,499
But "best friend"? No.

648
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,250
Excuse me, one sec.

649
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:20,635
He acted like
noelle was a complete stranger.

650
00:36:20,672 --> 00:36:21,762
Of course he did.

651
00:36:22,132 --> 00:36:23,422
Look, these two are yours.

652
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:25,837
Oh, look. He's being a good guy...

653
00:36:25,886 --> 00:36:27,806
So everybody can see him
being a good guy.

654
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:29,636
You really don't like him, do you?

655
00:36:29,681 --> 00:36:31,181
What's to like?

656
00:36:52,871 --> 00:36:56,501
This mailbox is currently full.
Press one to...

657
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:59,921
Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.
My name's shawna Kelly.

658
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,880
I am so sorry for your troubles.

659
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:03,843
Thank you. That's kind.

660
00:37:03,882 --> 00:37:05,302
Are you remembering to eat?

661
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:06,472
Well, a lot of cold cuts.

662
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:10,680
I'm gonna fix you up
my world-famous chicken frito pie.

663
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:12,242
That's very kind and very unnecessary.

664
00:37:12,265 --> 00:37:13,895
You have to keep your strength.

665
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:15,434
Would you...

666
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:18,191
Say, "chicken frito pie!"

667
00:37:22,401 --> 00:37:23,691
You know what?

668
00:37:24,945 --> 00:37:26,325
Would you delete that picture for me?

669
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:28,243
- It's a nice photo.
- I know it is.

670
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:29,701
But just do me a favor.

671
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:31,491
Will you?

672
00:37:31,535 --> 00:37:34,455
Would you go ahead
and please delete that picture?

673
00:37:34,496 --> 00:37:35,496
You just press...

674
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:37,039
What is wrong with you?

675
00:37:37,082 --> 00:37:38,372
Could you please not
share that with anyone?

676
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:41,747
I will share it with whomever I please.

677
00:37:45,549 --> 00:37:46,919
- Dude.
- Yeah?

678
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:48,297
Marybeth is pissed.

679
00:37:49,011 --> 00:37:50,011
Why?

680
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:54,261
Marybeth?

681
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:57,727
It's like you're the goddamn
homecoming king.

682
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:02,607
It was important to my mother
that I be polite...

683
00:38:02,649 --> 00:38:04,569
I be considerate, I be a gentleman.

684
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:06,319
It looked like you were having fun.

685
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:08,611
I am in a nightmare!

686
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:11,742
All I'm trying to do is be nice...

687
00:38:11,783 --> 00:38:15,493
To the people who are
volunteering to help find Amy.

688
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:19,216
You're right.

689
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:22,043
And I'm sorry.

690
00:38:24,046 --> 00:38:27,676
My God, this place literally
smells like feces.

691
00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:41,983
In your searches,
did you find any golf clubs, real fancy?

692
00:38:42,022 --> 00:38:43,442
No.

693
00:38:44,566 --> 00:38:46,276
How about a brand new stratocaster?

694
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:47,438
No, nothing like that.

695
00:38:48,153 --> 00:38:50,243
Well, all right.

696
00:38:55,243 --> 00:38:58,293
How big's that TV? It's not 65-inch.

697
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,620
No, it's nowhere near that.

698
00:38:59,665 --> 00:39:00,755
Okay.

699
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,618
- Kibble?
- Excuse me?

700
00:39:02,668 --> 00:39:04,748
He asked me to feed his cat.

701
00:39:04,795 --> 00:39:06,005
I saw some in the pantry.

702
00:39:06,338 --> 00:39:11,088
Detective boney, officer gilpin?
Noelle hawthorne!

703
00:39:11,134 --> 00:39:12,724
I know y'all are in there!

704
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:17,261
Would you please escort miss hawthorne
and her children back out to the street?

705
00:39:18,141 --> 00:39:20,231
Detective boney!

706
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:24,098
Just remind her
it is a possible crime scene.

707
00:39:32,823 --> 00:39:37,663
Look at that pie-eating grin,
from a guy whose wife is missing.

708
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:45,038
- How are you doing?
- Terrific.

709
00:39:46,795 --> 00:39:48,305
How's marybeth?

710
00:39:48,338 --> 00:39:50,168
She's a wreck.

711
00:39:50,215 --> 00:39:51,675
And you?

712
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,930
Awesome.

713
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:54,969
Hey...

714
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,550
Have you told me everything?

715
00:39:56,805 --> 00:39:57,805
Of course.

716
00:39:57,806 --> 00:39:58,806
Everything?

717
00:39:58,807 --> 00:39:59,967
Why would you even ask me that?

718
00:40:00,017 --> 00:40:04,187
Ever since you walked into the bar that
morning Amy went missing, you seem...

719
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
- Off.
- I am off.

720
00:40:07,524 --> 00:40:10,864
Everybody's examining me
and projecting their shit on me.

721
00:40:10,902 --> 00:40:14,322
All I want is to come over here,
have a beer with you...

722
00:40:14,364 --> 00:40:15,704
And not be judged.

723
00:40:15,741 --> 00:40:17,241
Can we do that?

724
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:19,657
Of course.

725
00:40:21,038 --> 00:40:23,038
You know what I keep thinking?

726
00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:24,121
If mom were here?

727
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:27,586
Yeah. Like I'm 12.

728
00:40:29,046 --> 00:40:31,846
Nick, mom would fix it.

729
00:40:39,056 --> 00:40:42,276
I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep.

730
00:40:45,187 --> 00:40:47,517
- Love you.
- Love you.

731
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,900
So, here's a strange, new sentence.

732
00:40:53,945 --> 00:40:57,415
I am a missourian.

733
00:41:04,206 --> 00:41:05,586
Bye, dad.

734
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:10,961
No money, no jobs, no prospects.

735
00:41:11,004 --> 00:41:13,174
And then, we heard from go.

736
00:41:13,215 --> 00:41:15,135
Mama Maureen...

737
00:41:15,175 --> 00:41:18,015
Stage 4 breast cancer.

738
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,020
So, we moved to Missouri.

739
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:24,678
I don't mind.

740
00:41:24,726 --> 00:41:27,896
I just wish he'd asked.

741
00:41:39,574 --> 00:41:42,034
Nick is happy to be home.

742
00:41:42,077 --> 00:41:44,577
But I don't know
if he's happy I'm with him.

743
00:41:46,081 --> 00:41:49,331
I feel like something
he loaded by mistake.

744
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:52,546
Something to be jettisoned,
if necessary.

745
00:41:52,587 --> 00:41:54,797
Something disposable.

746
00:41:56,633 --> 00:41:59,263
I feel like I could disappear.

747
00:42:43,263 --> 00:42:45,263
Oh, my God!

748
00:42:45,307 --> 00:42:47,267
- I saw you on TV.
- Okay.

749
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:48,979
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah, I know.

750
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:51,229
- She just vanished?
- She's just gone.

751
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:53,111
- I've been so worried about you.
- Where have you been?

752
00:42:53,148 --> 00:42:54,978
I called you a hundred times.
You gotta pick up your phone!

753
00:42:55,025 --> 00:42:56,075
Rehearsals.

754
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:57,149
What?

755
00:42:57,194 --> 00:42:58,494
Godspell.

756
00:43:00,322 --> 00:43:01,912
My sister's asleep in the other room.

757
00:43:01,948 --> 00:43:03,068
I needed to see you.

758
00:43:03,116 --> 00:43:04,776
I know this is a bad idea.

759
00:43:04,826 --> 00:43:06,326
Can you at least tell me you love me?

760
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:10,120
I do love you, but we have
to be really careful right now.

761
00:43:10,165 --> 00:43:11,425
I've been so scared.

762
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:12,668
Between rehearsals?

763
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:14,459
You told me
I needed to have my own life.

764
00:43:14,503 --> 00:43:16,003
I know.

765
00:43:16,046 --> 00:43:17,306
We need to stop.

766
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:18,509
I need you.

767
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:21,473
Touch me.

768
00:43:24,888 --> 00:43:27,508
Stop it. Come here.

769
00:43:28,892 --> 00:43:30,602
Sit down.

770
00:43:30,644 --> 00:43:31,984
Okay.

771
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:36,110
Did you, by any chance,
tell anybody anything about us?

772
00:43:36,149 --> 00:43:37,649
Even in texting, or on Facebook.

773
00:43:37,693 --> 00:43:40,493
Facebook? I use the disposable phone.

774
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:42,449
You buy my presents in cash.
I'm not stupid, Nick.

775
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:45,369
I know, sweetie. Did you leave a
pair of red panties in my office?

776
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:48,829
I don't know. Maybe.
They better be mine.

777
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:49,870
Sweetheart, think.

778
00:43:49,871 --> 00:43:52,331
I don't know. I'd have to check
my red panty inventory.

779
00:43:52,374 --> 00:43:55,004
Andie, I need you
to take this seriously, okay?

780
00:43:55,043 --> 00:43:56,843
This is the last time
we're gonna see each other, until...

781
00:43:56,878 --> 00:43:58,338
Until when?

782
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,340
Until it's safe.

783
00:44:00,382 --> 00:44:01,972
You were going to get a divorce.

784
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:04,179
Never say that out loud again.

785
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:06,889
Okay. I'm sorry.

786
00:44:07,764 --> 00:44:08,764
I don't wanna fight.

787
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:12,347
I just wanna be with you.

788
00:44:12,394 --> 00:44:13,564
Andie, please...

789
00:44:14,396 --> 00:44:16,066
That's all I want.

790
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:18,479
I can't.

791
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:23,069
It's our last time together.

792
00:44:23,113 --> 00:44:25,163
Let's make the most of it.

793
00:44:31,913 --> 00:44:35,253
Real quick, but then you have to go.

794
00:44:38,086 --> 00:44:40,876
My husband has come undone.

795
00:44:40,922 --> 00:44:43,882
We moved to Missouri to save Maureen...

796
00:44:43,925 --> 00:44:46,645
But as it turns out, we couldn't.

797
00:44:49,931 --> 00:44:51,681
It means a lot that you came.

798
00:44:52,851 --> 00:44:54,231
We took a hit on the brownstone...

799
00:44:54,269 --> 00:44:56,599
And I used the last of my trust fund
to buy him a bar.

800
00:44:57,356 --> 00:44:59,616
So far, it's just costing money.

801
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:07,610
Nick uses me for sex when he wants.

802
00:45:10,786 --> 00:45:13,296
Otherwise, I don't exist.

803
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:16,619
We should go to outback tonight.

804
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:17,917
That would be nice.

805
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:21,039
Last night, I went from desperate
to pathetic.

806
00:45:21,963 --> 00:45:25,133
I became someone I don't even like.

807
00:45:25,175 --> 00:45:26,975
The kind of woman I used to mock.

808
00:45:27,386 --> 00:45:29,096
You're out so much.

809
00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:31,467
- I know.
- Stay home.

810
00:45:31,515 --> 00:45:33,855
- I can't, I'm already late.
- Then, can I come?

811
00:45:33,892 --> 00:45:35,682
You would hate it.

812
00:45:35,727 --> 00:45:38,977
It's a bunch
of my dorky high school friends.

813
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:42,861
Do our code. No bullshit.

814
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:45,688
I thought
we weren't gonna be that couple.

815
00:45:52,202 --> 00:45:54,042
Okay, bye.

816
00:45:55,706 --> 00:45:58,676
- Hey, I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

817
00:45:58,709 --> 00:46:00,079
Something positive.

818
00:46:01,503 --> 00:46:02,543
Maybe it's time.

819
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,669
Now is literally the worst time.

820
00:46:05,716 --> 00:46:06,956
It would be a new start for us.

821
00:46:07,175 --> 00:46:09,895
And for me,
I would have a real purpose here.

822
00:46:09,928 --> 00:46:11,138
A child is not a hobby.

823
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:12,179
Not a hobby.

824
00:46:13,181 --> 00:46:14,391
An inspiration.

825
00:46:14,933 --> 00:46:18,063
We could have had this fight
four hours ago. I'm late.

826
00:46:18,103 --> 00:46:19,353
I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.

827
00:46:19,396 --> 00:46:22,816
You really wanna be the couple
that has a baby to save their marriage?

828
00:46:22,858 --> 00:46:23,858
"Save"?

829
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:26,529
Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!

830
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:28,740
- And you're gonna walk out the door now?
- Yeah!

831
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,320
You're a fucking coward.

832
00:46:31,366 --> 00:46:33,236
No, it can't go on like this.

833
00:46:33,285 --> 00:46:34,335
Really?

834
00:46:34,369 --> 00:46:35,869
- I won't.
- You won't?

835
00:46:35,912 --> 00:46:38,252
You won't?
Why, it's not good enough for you?

836
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,210
It's not even close!

837
00:46:39,249 --> 00:46:41,379
You stupid bitch!

838
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,920
What scared me
wasn't that he'd pushed me.

839
00:46:44,963 --> 00:46:48,803
What scared me was how much
he wanted to hurt me more.

840
00:46:49,134 --> 00:46:51,224
What scared me
was that I'd finally realized...

841
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,890
I am frightened of my own husband.

842
00:47:07,778 --> 00:47:09,278
You want me to call for backup?

843
00:47:09,321 --> 00:47:11,411
Nah, I'll protect you.

844
00:47:19,164 --> 00:47:20,584
Jesus.

845
00:47:25,629 --> 00:47:28,299
They ought to burn this place down.

846
00:47:28,757 --> 00:47:30,417
Seems like folks are trying.

847
00:47:35,931 --> 00:47:38,221
You really think this is anything?

848
00:47:38,266 --> 00:47:40,426
Cross it off the list.

849
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,240
Hey, Jason.

850
00:47:53,281 --> 00:47:54,821
What's up, Rhonda?

851
00:47:54,866 --> 00:47:57,116
"...and dedicated to the proposition
that all men..."

852
00:47:58,203 --> 00:48:00,703
- Have you seen this girl around here?
- Why do you ask?

853
00:48:00,956 --> 00:48:02,796
She was reported missing.

854
00:48:05,961 --> 00:48:07,841
"...and so dedicated, can long endure."

855
00:48:07,879 --> 00:48:09,799
Yeah. I remember her.

856
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,970
What did she want?
Weed, pills?

857
00:48:13,635 --> 00:48:14,645
She wanted a gun.

858
00:48:14,886 --> 00:48:16,926
I told her it's not my thing.

859
00:48:16,972 --> 00:48:19,972
I felt bad, though.
She seemed really desperate.

860
00:48:20,017 --> 00:48:23,597
She said it needed to be small,
so she could keep it close.

861
00:48:23,645 --> 00:48:25,485
Are you sure this is her?

862
00:48:25,522 --> 00:48:27,652
You don't forget a girl like that
in here.

863
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:30,150
She was all in pink.

864
00:48:30,193 --> 00:48:32,743
It was Valentine's day.

865
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:38,449
For Valentine's day,
I thought I'd buy a gun.

866
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:41,083
That is how crazy I've become.

867
00:48:42,164 --> 00:48:46,294
Nick wants me gone
but he won't ask for a divorce.

868
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:50,465
In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar,
his only line of credit.

869
00:48:50,505 --> 00:48:52,015
The bitch with the prenup.

870
00:48:53,842 --> 00:48:56,182
I could go home to my parents...

871
00:48:56,219 --> 00:48:58,639
But I'd have to tell them the truth.

872
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,520
And I don't even know
if I believe the truth.

873
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,349
Can I really think Nick would hurt me?

874
00:49:05,979 --> 00:49:08,359
I'm being paranoid. Crazy.

875
00:49:09,691 --> 00:49:10,691
It's just...

876
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:14,191
I'd sleep better with a gun.

877
00:49:25,082 --> 00:49:26,502
Oh, shit.

878
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:30,171
Wake up, baby.
My sister's gonna come out here.

879
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:36,759
- Sorry to rush you.
- It's okay.

880
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,220
- Here. Let me help you.
- Okay.

881
00:49:40,263 --> 00:49:42,353
Just get that.

882
00:49:45,018 --> 00:49:46,518
Be very careful.

883
00:49:47,354 --> 00:49:48,354
I'm all right.

884
00:49:48,397 --> 00:49:50,977
Here you go.

885
00:49:51,024 --> 00:49:52,904
Promise me we'll talk every day.

886
00:49:52,943 --> 00:49:54,193
Okay, we will.

887
00:49:54,236 --> 00:49:56,956
Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy.

888
00:49:57,739 --> 00:49:58,819
Don't go crazy.

889
00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:00,125
Okay.

890
00:50:04,538 --> 00:50:07,868
You fucking idiot.

891
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:11,746
You fucking asshole!
You fucking lied to my fucking face!

892
00:50:13,255 --> 00:50:14,805
I'm sorry.

893
00:50:16,591 --> 00:50:17,591
How old is she?

894
00:50:17,926 --> 00:50:19,126
She's in her early 20s.

895
00:50:20,053 --> 00:50:21,053
How long?

896
00:50:21,596 --> 00:50:24,386
- A year and a half.
- You lied to me for over a year?

897
00:50:24,433 --> 00:50:26,113
If I told you,
you would have made me stop.

898
00:50:26,143 --> 00:50:27,733
It's so fucking small.

899
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:30,729
You're a liar and a cheat!
You're just like dad!

900
00:50:30,772 --> 00:50:32,062
How did you even meet her?

901
00:50:32,107 --> 00:50:33,317
She's one of my students.

902
00:50:34,568 --> 00:50:36,238
I thought writers hated clichés.

903
00:50:36,278 --> 00:50:37,108
I'm not a writer.

904
00:50:37,154 --> 00:50:39,404
"Boo-hoo, I got laid off.
I guess I'll fuck a teenager."

905
00:50:39,448 --> 00:50:42,238
It wasn't like that, okay? You have
no idea how shitty it was with Amy...

906
00:50:42,284 --> 00:50:44,204
How fucking terrible she made me feel.

907
00:50:44,244 --> 00:50:47,414
Flyover boy.
I would get knots in my stomach...

908
00:50:47,456 --> 00:50:49,296
Just coming home,
knowing she would be sitting there...

909
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:51,493
Dissatisfied, before I even
walked in the fucking door.

910
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:52,921
This is so bad.

911
00:50:52,961 --> 00:50:55,051
If anybody finds out,
you're totally fucked.

912
00:50:55,088 --> 00:50:57,708
Boney found a pair of panties
in my office...

913
00:50:57,758 --> 00:50:59,298
Where, occasionally, Andie and I...

914
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,880
I don't know what the fuck it means.

915
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:02,087
Are they super-twat's?

916
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:04,217
Her name is Andie.

917
00:51:04,264 --> 00:51:05,764
She's not entirely sure.

918
00:51:05,807 --> 00:51:07,467
So we are dealing with a 20-year-old...

919
00:51:07,517 --> 00:51:08,927
Who isn't sure
where she leaves her undies?

920
00:51:08,977 --> 00:51:11,227
If they're not Andie's,
that means that they're Amy's...

921
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:12,981
And she left them there for me to find.

922
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:16,783
Nick, I was scared for you before,
and now, I'm fucking petrified.

923
00:51:16,818 --> 00:51:19,108
We're having a vigil tonight
for your missing wife...

924
00:51:19,154 --> 00:51:22,284
And this morning, you're kissing
your college girlfriend goodbye!

925
00:51:22,324 --> 00:51:23,494
Can you imagine?

926
00:51:24,117 --> 00:51:27,447
Have you watched television lately?

927
00:51:27,496 --> 00:51:30,506
Cable news is all over your shit.

928
00:51:31,124 --> 00:51:32,964
I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?

929
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:35,291
His wife's nowhere to be found...

930
00:51:35,337 --> 00:51:39,007
And here's Nick dunne for you, flirting.
Cute pic, huh?

931
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:41,509
- Who is that?
- Some fucking tragedy groupie.

932
00:51:41,551 --> 00:51:43,471
- Who the fuck is that?
- I don't know.

933
00:51:43,512 --> 00:51:44,642
She was trying to give me a casserole.

934
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,810
On the show today
we have defense attorney, Tanner bolt...

935
00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:50,389
Patron Saint to wife-killers everywhere.

936
00:51:50,686 --> 00:51:54,196
Tanner bolt, would you actually consider
defending Nick dunne?

937
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:55,361
Well, let me just say...

938
00:51:55,399 --> 00:51:58,149
As always, Ellen,
thank you for such a warm welcome.

939
00:51:58,193 --> 00:51:59,743
But of course, I'd defend Nick dunne.

940
00:52:00,028 --> 00:52:02,528
Listen, just because this guy
isn't walking around weeping...

941
00:52:02,572 --> 00:52:03,992
That doesn't mean that he's not hurting.

942
00:52:04,032 --> 00:52:07,372
Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath
is a lack of empathy.

943
00:52:07,411 --> 00:52:09,371
But the truth is,
you'd have to be a sociopath...

944
00:52:09,871 --> 00:52:11,661
To behave normally in this situation...

945
00:52:11,707 --> 00:52:14,457
Because it's the most
abnormal situation in the world.

946
00:52:14,501 --> 00:52:17,171
Tanner, are you trying to tell me
that this photo...

947
00:52:17,212 --> 00:52:19,462
Is remotely in the realm
of acceptable behavior?

948
00:52:19,506 --> 00:52:22,166
I'm so sick
of being picked apart by women.

949
00:52:23,552 --> 00:52:25,432
You need to hire Tanner bolt.

950
00:52:27,514 --> 00:52:28,314
I don't deserve this.

951
00:52:28,348 --> 00:52:30,218
Innocent until proven guilty.

952
00:52:30,267 --> 00:52:32,637
That's exactly what you deserve.

953
00:52:32,686 --> 00:52:34,236
Go home, Nick.

954
00:53:00,213 --> 00:53:01,633
Hey, buddy.

955
00:53:17,522 --> 00:53:19,312
I can't believe
we haven't arrested this guy.

956
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:21,318
We're not gonna arrest anybody...

957
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,920
Just because some blonde dunce says so.

958
00:53:23,278 --> 00:53:25,778
Why are you going so easy on him?
You got a crush?

959
00:53:26,073 --> 00:53:29,413
One, I am conducting an investigation,
not a witch-hunt.

960
00:53:29,451 --> 00:53:31,371
And, two,
don't talk to me that way, ever.

961
00:53:31,411 --> 00:53:32,701
She was trying to buy a gun.

962
00:53:32,746 --> 00:53:34,916
We don't know who
or what was scaring her, gil.

963
00:53:34,956 --> 00:53:35,956
Give me the update.

964
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:39,078
No drug angles panned out yet,
so cross that off the list.

965
00:53:39,127 --> 00:53:41,087
I talked to the nurses
who care for Nick's father.

966
00:53:41,129 --> 00:53:43,839
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as
a kitten, so cross that off the list.

967
00:53:43,882 --> 00:53:45,052
- Hey.
- Hey.

968
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:48,512
So, luminol lit up the kitchen
like the 4th of July.

969
00:53:48,553 --> 00:53:49,853
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

970
00:53:49,888 --> 00:53:51,008
The blood is profuse.

971
00:53:51,056 --> 00:53:53,276
It is Amy's, type b,
and we should have DNA soon.

972
00:53:53,308 --> 00:53:54,388
Thoughts on a weapon?

973
00:53:54,434 --> 00:53:56,354
Trajectory indicates blunt force.

974
00:53:56,395 --> 00:53:58,735
Maybe a club or a two-by-four.

975
00:53:59,314 --> 00:54:02,574
She fell there,
but I doubt she got back up.

976
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:04,029
Amy's medical records come in?

977
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:06,069
No, we'll have them later tonight.

978
00:54:07,656 --> 00:54:09,076
My wife says he's a killer.

979
00:54:09,324 --> 00:54:11,664
Well, if Tiffany says...

980
00:54:37,269 --> 00:54:38,269
Hey.

981
00:54:38,603 --> 00:54:39,603
Hey.

982
00:54:44,026 --> 00:54:45,186
Thank you all for coming out.

983
00:54:46,862 --> 00:54:48,492
Hey Donnie, how are you?

984
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:51,870
Rich, thank you so much.

985
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:00,176
Hey.

986
00:55:07,215 --> 00:55:10,805
Thank you, folks.
Thank you for being here tonight.

987
00:55:10,844 --> 00:55:12,644
It just means the world to our family.

988
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,640
And to Amy.

989
00:55:15,223 --> 00:55:17,223
As you all know...

990
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,350
My wife, Amy elliott dunne...

991
00:55:21,396 --> 00:55:22,896
Disappeared three days ago.

992
00:55:23,482 --> 00:55:27,032
And I want to implore anyone
who has any information at all...

993
00:55:27,069 --> 00:55:29,989
Please come forward. Help us.

994
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:30,950
So hot.

995
00:55:30,989 --> 00:55:32,359
He is so creepy.

996
00:55:32,407 --> 00:55:35,867
I wanna say something, because I think
some of you might be wondering...

997
00:55:35,911 --> 00:55:37,831
And are too polite to ask.

998
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:41,420
I had nothing to do
with the disappearance of my wife.

999
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,960
I'm cooperating with the police.

1000
00:55:44,002 --> 00:55:46,042
I haven't hired a lawyer.

1001
00:55:46,088 --> 00:55:47,208
I have nothing to hide.

1002
00:55:48,507 --> 00:55:51,007
Amy is my soul mate.

1003
00:55:51,259 --> 00:55:52,549
She is brilliant...

1004
00:55:53,095 --> 00:55:56,185
She's charming, and wise.

1005
00:55:56,515 --> 00:55:58,225
I love you, Amy.

1006
00:56:02,354 --> 00:56:03,444
Asshole.

1007
00:56:04,773 --> 00:56:06,693
I love my wife...

1008
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:08,277
So much.

1009
00:56:10,779 --> 00:56:15,119
And I may not behave for the cameras
the way they want me to...

1010
00:56:15,534 --> 00:56:18,744
And if they wanna punish me for that,
that's okay.

1011
00:56:18,787 --> 00:56:22,497
But I just wanna ask you in the media,
please, harass me...

1012
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:25,581
But don't harass
the people of this town.

1013
00:56:25,627 --> 00:56:27,667
If you need to mock somebody, mock me.

1014
00:56:27,713 --> 00:56:28,923
Nick!

1015
00:56:28,964 --> 00:56:31,124
But please don't turn this investigation
into a circus.

1016
00:56:31,133 --> 00:56:32,723
Where's your wife, Nick?

1017
00:56:32,759 --> 00:56:34,259
Let the police do their jobs.

1018
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,300
What did you do to your pregnant wife?

1019
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,390
Did you tell them that, Nick?

1020
00:56:39,433 --> 00:56:41,483
Did you tell them
Amy was six weeks pregnant?

1021
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:47,400
Thank you for your support tonight.
Let's find Amy.

1022
00:56:49,568 --> 00:56:51,208
Go ahead,
if you guys wanna say something.

1023
00:56:55,282 --> 00:56:56,662
Gil, go, go.

1024
00:56:58,994 --> 00:57:00,124
Nick, where are you going?

1025
00:57:00,162 --> 00:57:01,752
Stop him!

1026
00:57:01,788 --> 00:57:03,998
No questions right now. Thank you.

1027
00:57:06,501 --> 00:57:08,041
Why are you running away?

1028
00:57:09,129 --> 00:57:10,549
Don't run.

1029
00:57:11,631 --> 00:57:12,631
Everybody, stay back.

1030
00:57:17,429 --> 00:57:19,599
Guys, come on. You know better.

1031
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:22,099
Get off the grass, get down to the curb.

1032
00:57:22,142 --> 00:57:23,562
- Hey, gil...
- On it.

1033
00:57:23,602 --> 00:57:24,642
All right.

1034
00:57:24,686 --> 00:57:26,476
All right, y'all heard her. No pictures.

1035
00:57:26,521 --> 00:57:27,811
Hello?

1036
00:57:28,565 --> 00:57:30,115
Hello?

1037
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:30,980
Fuck.

1038
00:57:31,026 --> 00:57:32,536
You scared me. Want a drink?

1039
00:57:32,569 --> 00:57:34,069
Did you know she was pregnant?

1040
00:57:34,112 --> 00:57:36,242
I told you,
noelle hawthorne is fucking crazy.

1041
00:57:36,281 --> 00:57:37,321
She doesn't even know Amy.

1042
00:57:37,991 --> 00:57:39,591
They look like pretty good friends
to me.

1043
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:50,587
Look, I don't know. But it certainly
doesn't prove that she's pregnant.

1044
00:57:50,629 --> 00:57:51,839
We have her medical records coming.

1045
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,760
- Good.
- So, let's talk while we wait.

1046
00:57:53,799 --> 00:57:56,009
Let's start over here.
The scene of the crime.

1047
00:57:56,051 --> 00:57:58,931
You see, we've seen dozens
of home invasions.

1048
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:00,930
Dozens and dozens.

1049
00:58:00,972 --> 00:58:03,182
This area right here, it looked wrong
from the second we saw it.

1050
00:58:03,225 --> 00:58:06,395
The whole thing looked staged.
Watch this.

1051
00:58:08,313 --> 00:58:11,733
And yet, they remained upright
throughout this life-and-death struggle?

1052
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,900
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

1053
00:58:13,944 --> 00:58:15,574
Did you do any housekeeping
the day your wife went missing?

1054
00:58:15,612 --> 00:58:16,612
No.

1055
00:58:16,613 --> 00:58:18,863
Because our guys did a luminol test.

1056
00:58:18,907 --> 00:58:21,577
And I'm sorry to tell you,
but that kitchen lit up.

1057
00:58:21,618 --> 00:58:23,868
Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick.
A lot.

1058
00:58:23,912 --> 00:58:24,912
Oh, my God.

1059
00:58:24,913 --> 00:58:26,253
Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up.

1060
00:58:26,289 --> 00:58:28,749
Wait a second.
Why would they mop up the blood...

1061
00:58:28,792 --> 00:58:30,392
If they're trying to stage
a crime scene?

1062
00:58:30,419 --> 00:58:33,169
No blood and no body
suggests kidnapping.

1063
00:58:33,213 --> 00:58:35,633
It tells us,
look at people outside the house.

1064
00:58:35,674 --> 00:58:37,094
Like these homeless you keep mentioning.

1065
00:58:37,134 --> 00:58:40,224
A pool of blood and no body
suggests homicide.

1066
00:58:40,262 --> 00:58:42,262
It tells us to look at people
inside the house.

1067
00:58:42,305 --> 00:58:45,025
- Which is what we're doing here, Nick.
- I see.

1068
00:58:45,058 --> 00:58:48,018
So, how was your marriage, Nick?
Because right now, all we got is noelle.

1069
00:58:48,061 --> 00:58:49,601
She says, "not good."

1070
00:58:49,646 --> 00:58:51,146
Gil, what do you and your wife
argue about?

1071
00:58:51,189 --> 00:58:53,319
- What pisses you off?
- Money, lack thereof.

1072
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:55,108
Me and my ex, it's the same.

1073
00:58:55,152 --> 00:58:58,492
I mention that because
we got a look at your finances, Nick.

1074
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:01,240
$117,000 in credit card debt.

1075
00:59:01,283 --> 00:59:03,243
- What?
- I pulled up some of the merchandise.

1076
00:59:03,285 --> 00:59:05,295
There are these fun little splurges.

1077
00:59:05,329 --> 00:59:06,869
I didn't buy any of this stuff.

1078
00:59:06,913 --> 00:59:08,043
I don't even golf!

1079
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:09,411
I do! You bought great clubs.

1080
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:10,748
I like the robot dog.

1081
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:12,752
This is identity theft!
This is a felony!

1082
00:59:12,794 --> 00:59:13,754
We need to find out who did this!

1083
00:59:13,795 --> 00:59:15,555
All right.
Let's talk about life insurance.

1084
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:18,129
Because in April,
you bumped up Amy's life insurance...

1085
00:59:18,175 --> 00:59:19,175
To $1.2 million.

1086
00:59:19,217 --> 00:59:21,587
Yes, I did. That was her idea.
She wanted me to.

1087
00:59:21,636 --> 00:59:22,796
You filed the paperwork.

1088
00:59:22,846 --> 00:59:24,046
Because she told me to!

1089
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:25,810
Hold on a sec.

1090
00:59:25,849 --> 00:59:27,639
Yeah? Okay.

1091
00:59:29,561 --> 00:59:30,731
For sure?

1092
00:59:31,146 --> 00:59:32,316
All right.

1093
00:59:36,401 --> 00:59:37,401
She was pregnant.

1094
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:43,120
This is insane.

1095
00:59:43,158 --> 00:59:45,658
So, my question becomes...

1096
00:59:45,702 --> 00:59:48,622
I don't want to talk
to you again, ever...

1097
00:59:48,664 --> 00:59:49,834
Without a lawyer.

1098
00:59:58,173 --> 00:59:59,173
Margo!

1099
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,060
Hey.

1100
01:00:13,438 --> 01:00:15,858
Just hold on a second. Let me finish.

1101
01:00:15,899 --> 01:00:16,819
Nick?

1102
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:19,648
I hear you, I hear you.
I was as surprised as...

1103
01:00:19,695 --> 01:00:23,535
I know you're upset.
I had no idea she was pregnant.

1104
01:00:23,949 --> 01:00:27,079
Listen, I thought so, too,
but evidently that wasn't...

1105
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:31,709
you want to know the truth?

1106
01:00:31,748 --> 01:00:34,118
The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.

1107
01:00:36,545 --> 01:00:38,595
Well, I'm as surprised as...

1108
01:00:39,923 --> 01:00:41,723
you told me you didn't want kids.

1109
01:00:42,718 --> 01:00:44,118
I was trying to put a good face on.

1110
01:00:44,136 --> 01:00:46,016
Then, suddenly,
you've got a pregnant wife.

1111
01:00:46,054 --> 01:00:47,394
That's a problem for you.

1112
01:00:47,431 --> 01:00:50,521
Especially when you factor in
the secret teenage girlfriend.

1113
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,019
Oh, stop watching Ellen abbott!

1114
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,390
You have to fucking talk to me!

1115
01:00:56,064 --> 01:01:00,114
I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids
because she didn't want me to.

1116
01:01:00,152 --> 01:01:02,362
Because it would have just been
another reason for you to hate her.

1117
01:01:02,404 --> 01:01:04,284
And we had enough of those already!
It was easier to just...

1118
01:01:04,322 --> 01:01:06,532
- lie to me?
- I wanted kids!

1119
01:01:06,575 --> 01:01:08,745
When we first moved here,
I went to a fertility clinic!

1120
01:01:08,785 --> 01:01:10,455
- It didn't work?
- I did my part!

1121
01:01:10,495 --> 01:01:11,545
Masturbate.

1122
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,290
When it came time for Amy to do her thing,
all of a sudden it was like...

1123
01:01:13,332 --> 01:01:14,872
"Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks."

1124
01:01:14,916 --> 01:01:16,916
Now, who would believe you?

1125
01:01:18,086 --> 01:01:19,286
All right.

1126
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,720
This is a letter from the clinic...

1127
01:01:30,766 --> 01:01:33,236
Notifying me
that they're gonna destroy my sample...

1128
01:01:33,268 --> 01:01:35,268
Unless I contact them.

1129
01:01:36,521 --> 01:01:38,061
So, I gave it to Amy.

1130
01:01:38,106 --> 01:01:41,106
The next day, I saw it in the trash.

1131
01:01:41,151 --> 01:01:42,731
But you were already with Andie
by then, right?

1132
01:01:42,778 --> 01:01:45,608
I wanted a baby with Amy.

1133
01:01:45,655 --> 01:01:49,835
A year ago, Amy being pregnant
would have been the best thing ever!

1134
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:58,255
"When your poor Amy has a cold,
this dessert just..."

1135
01:01:58,293 --> 01:01:59,673
this is the clue you couldn't solve.

1136
01:01:59,711 --> 01:02:00,841
Yeah.

1137
01:02:02,547 --> 01:02:05,917
A letter from desi.
That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?

1138
01:02:05,967 --> 01:02:08,337
It was the fucking rich guy
who would do anything for her.

1139
01:02:08,387 --> 01:02:10,347
It just kept hanging over my head.
It was disgusting.

1140
01:02:10,389 --> 01:02:11,389
Your prenup?

1141
01:02:11,723 --> 01:02:14,683
Nick, why have you kept this stuff?
It's like a little box of hate.

1142
01:02:14,726 --> 01:02:16,516
I don't know, go! Maybe I hate her!

1143
01:02:19,398 --> 01:02:22,518
I love you no matter what.

1144
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:23,937
But you need to tell me.

1145
01:02:23,985 --> 01:02:25,405
Tell you what?

1146
01:02:26,238 --> 01:02:27,858
What are you asking me?

1147
01:02:29,449 --> 01:02:32,619
Are you asking me
if I killed my wife, go?

1148
01:02:33,078 --> 01:02:35,158
Is that what you're asking me?
If I murdered my wife?

1149
01:02:35,205 --> 01:02:37,625
I would never ask you that!

1150
01:02:41,586 --> 01:02:42,586
Margo!

1151
01:02:55,392 --> 01:02:57,602
Don't walk on the glass.

1152
01:02:59,312 --> 01:03:01,942
You have no clue, do you?

1153
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:21,330
Why was he here that night?

1154
01:03:22,961 --> 01:03:25,801
His wife is missing. Why come here?

1155
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:26,839
Who cares?

1156
01:03:27,049 --> 01:03:28,299
Rhonda, we got this.

1157
01:03:28,342 --> 01:03:29,842
Let's make the arrest.

1158
01:03:29,885 --> 01:03:31,975
Do you know how hard it is
to make a murder case without a body?

1159
01:03:32,012 --> 01:03:32,932
No.

1160
01:03:32,971 --> 01:03:35,141
Well, it's incredibly hard.

1161
01:03:35,182 --> 01:03:38,062
So, I want one last thing.

1162
01:03:38,101 --> 01:03:39,101
What's that?

1163
01:03:40,729 --> 01:03:43,019
I want a body.

1164
01:03:44,191 --> 01:03:48,611
Picture me.
I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

1165
01:03:48,653 --> 01:03:50,283
Be careful.

1166
01:03:54,826 --> 01:03:59,246
I need to be punished,
and by "punished," I mean "had."

1167
01:04:03,794 --> 01:04:04,794
Fuck.

1168
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:09,595
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.

1169
01:04:10,842 --> 01:04:13,012
So, open the door...

1170
01:04:13,053 --> 01:04:14,433
Punish. Wood. Beach.

1171
01:04:14,471 --> 01:04:16,971
...and look alive.

1172
01:04:20,102 --> 01:04:22,692
Punish. Wood.

1173
01:04:23,855 --> 01:04:25,445
Wood.

1174
01:04:57,556 --> 01:05:00,276
I will practice believing
my husband loves me...

1175
01:05:00,308 --> 01:05:02,728
And will love this baby.

1176
01:05:03,395 --> 01:05:07,025
That this child
might really save our marriage.

1177
01:05:07,899 --> 01:05:09,359
But I could be wrong.

1178
01:05:15,532 --> 01:05:17,452
Because sometimes...

1179
01:05:18,452 --> 01:05:20,662
The way he looks at me...

1180
01:05:21,747 --> 01:05:23,497
I think...

1181
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,620
Man of my dreams...

1182
01:05:26,543 --> 01:05:28,633
Father of my child...

1183
01:05:29,421 --> 01:05:33,421
This man of mine may kill me.

1184
01:05:34,801 --> 01:05:36,801
He may truly...

1185
01:05:37,721 --> 01:05:38,721
Kill me.

1186
01:05:41,433 --> 01:05:42,433
Wtf?

1187
01:06:07,376 --> 01:06:09,966
I am so much happier now that I'm dead.

1188
01:06:15,008 --> 01:06:16,588
Technically, "missing."

1189
01:06:17,427 --> 01:06:19,087
Soon to be presumed dead.

1190
01:06:20,806 --> 01:06:21,936
Gone.

1191
01:06:22,891 --> 01:06:26,141
And my lazy, lying, cheating,
oblivious husband...

1192
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:29,476
Will go to prison for my murder.

1193
01:06:30,774 --> 01:06:33,324
Nick dunne took my pride
and my dignity...

1194
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,860
And my hope and my money.

1195
01:06:35,904 --> 01:06:39,494
He took and took from me
until I no longer existed.

1196
01:06:39,533 --> 01:06:40,953
That's murder.

1197
01:06:40,993 --> 01:06:43,793
Let the punishment fit the crime.

1198
01:06:44,371 --> 01:06:47,371
To fake a convincing murder,
you have to have discipline.

1199
01:06:51,586 --> 01:06:54,586
You befriend a local idiot.

1200
01:06:58,135 --> 01:07:01,305
Harvest the details
of her humdrum life.

1201
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,270
And cram her with stories
about your husband's violent temper.

1202
01:07:06,393 --> 01:07:08,693
Secretly create some money troubles.

1203
01:07:08,937 --> 01:07:12,107
Credit cards, perhaps online gambling.

1204
01:07:14,735 --> 01:07:16,945
With the help of the unwitting...

1205
01:07:16,987 --> 01:07:18,987
Bump up your life insurance.

1206
01:07:20,699 --> 01:07:23,869
Purchase getaway car. Craigslist.

1207
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:27,200
Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.

1208
01:07:27,664 --> 01:07:32,294
You need to package yourself so that
people will truly mourn your loss.

1209
01:07:32,336 --> 01:07:35,306
And America loves pregnant women.

1210
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:38,630
As if it's so hard to spread your legs.

1211
01:07:38,675 --> 01:07:39,975
You know what's hard?

1212
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:42,429
Faking a pregnancy.

1213
01:07:42,471 --> 01:07:44,641
First, drain your toilet.

1214
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:49,100
Invite pregnant idiot into your home...

1215
01:07:49,144 --> 01:07:51,654
And ply her with lemonade.

1216
01:07:56,818 --> 01:07:58,988
Steal pregnant idiot's urine.

1217
01:08:01,198 --> 01:08:02,698
Voilà.

1218
01:08:02,741 --> 01:08:06,701
A pregnancy is now part
of your legal medical record.

1219
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:14,540
Happy anniversary.

1220
01:08:17,214 --> 01:08:19,974
Wait for your clueless husband...

1221
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:21,878
To start his day.

1222
01:08:23,345 --> 01:08:24,805
Off he goes.

1223
01:08:24,846 --> 01:08:27,006
And the clock is ticking.

1224
01:08:28,183 --> 01:08:30,683
Meticulously stage your crime scene...

1225
01:08:31,353 --> 01:08:35,363
With just enough mistakes
to raise the specter of doubt.

1226
01:08:36,775 --> 01:08:38,735
You need to bleed.

1227
01:08:39,069 --> 01:08:40,069
A lot.

1228
01:08:40,696 --> 01:08:42,366
A lot, a lot.

1229
01:08:45,701 --> 01:08:47,531
A head wound kind of bleed.

1230
01:08:48,203 --> 01:08:50,703
A crime scene kind of bleed.

1231
01:08:53,709 --> 01:08:55,829
You need to clean poorly...

1232
01:08:55,877 --> 01:08:56,877
Like he would.

1233
01:08:57,587 --> 01:09:00,087
Clean and bleed. Bleed and clean.

1234
01:09:00,716 --> 01:09:03,306
And leave a little something behind.

1235
01:09:03,969 --> 01:09:05,719
A fire in July?

1236
01:09:07,264 --> 01:09:08,354
And because you're you...

1237
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:09,640
You don't stop there.

1238
01:09:10,058 --> 01:09:12,268
You need a diary.

1239
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:15,230
Minimum, 300 entries
on the Nick and Amy story.

1240
01:09:15,897 --> 01:09:18,187
Start with the fairy tale early days.

1241
01:09:18,233 --> 01:09:20,533
Those are true. And they're crucial.

1242
01:09:20,569 --> 01:09:22,569
You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.

1243
01:09:22,904 --> 01:09:25,534
After that, you invent.

1244
01:09:25,574 --> 01:09:26,574
The spending.

1245
01:09:26,575 --> 01:09:28,375
The abuse. The fear.

1246
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:31,370
The threat of violence.

1247
01:09:31,413 --> 01:09:33,373
And Nick thought he was the writer.

1248
01:09:34,082 --> 01:09:35,372
Burn it just the right amount.

1249
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:39,090
Make sure the cops will find it.

1250
01:09:44,092 --> 01:09:47,142
Finally, honor tradition
with a very special treasure hunt.

1251
01:09:49,723 --> 01:09:52,523
And if I get everything right,
the world will hate Nick...

1252
01:09:52,559 --> 01:09:55,269
For killing his beautiful,
pregnant wife.

1253
01:09:55,312 --> 01:09:57,942
And after all the outrage,
when I'm ready...

1254
01:09:57,981 --> 01:09:59,981
I'll go out on the water
with a handful of pills...

1255
01:09:59,983 --> 01:10:02,533
And a pocket full of stones.

1256
01:10:02,569 --> 01:10:05,359
And when they find my body,
they'll know...

1257
01:10:05,405 --> 01:10:08,705
Nick dunne dumped his beloved
like garbage.

1258
01:10:08,742 --> 01:10:11,082
And she floated down
past all the other...

1259
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:14,449
Abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.

1260
01:10:15,832 --> 01:10:17,792
Then, Nick will die, too.

1261
01:10:18,669 --> 01:10:20,539
Nick and Amy will be gone.

1262
01:10:20,587 --> 01:10:22,707
But, then, we never really existed.

1263
01:10:22,756 --> 01:10:25,976
Nick loved a girl
I was pretending to be.

1264
01:10:26,009 --> 01:10:27,009
"Cool girl."

1265
01:10:27,469 --> 01:10:31,309
Men always use that
as their defining compliment.

1266
01:10:31,348 --> 01:10:32,348
"She's a cool girl."

1267
01:10:33,475 --> 01:10:34,605
Cool girl is hot.

1268
01:10:34,643 --> 01:10:36,063
Cool girl is game.

1269
01:10:36,103 --> 01:10:37,103
Cool girl is fun.

1270
01:10:37,437 --> 01:10:39,937
Cool girl never gets angry at her man.

1271
01:10:39,981 --> 01:10:42,611
She only smiles in a chagrined,
loving manner...

1272
01:10:43,276 --> 01:10:46,236
And then presents her mouth for fucking.

1273
01:10:46,279 --> 01:10:48,279
She likes what he likes.

1274
01:10:48,323 --> 01:10:51,783
So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster
who loves fetish manga.

1275
01:10:52,828 --> 01:10:56,118
If he likes girls gone wild,
she's a mall babe...

1276
01:10:56,164 --> 01:10:59,964
Who talks football
and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.

1277
01:11:00,002 --> 01:11:03,592
When I met Nick dunne,
I knew he wanted cool girl.

1278
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:06,300
And for him, I'll admit,
I was willing to try.

1279
01:11:06,341 --> 01:11:08,341
I wax-stripped my pussy raw.

1280
01:11:09,011 --> 01:11:12,141
I drank canned beer
watching Adam sandler movies.

1281
01:11:12,389 --> 01:11:15,179
I ate cold pizza
and remained a size two.

1282
01:11:15,225 --> 01:11:17,185
I blew him semi-regularly.

1283
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,850
I lived in the moment.

1284
01:11:20,147 --> 01:11:22,687
I was fucking game.

1285
01:11:23,316 --> 01:11:25,356
I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.

1286
01:11:26,194 --> 01:11:29,494
Nick teased out of me
things I didn't know existed.

1287
01:11:29,531 --> 01:11:32,831
A lightness, a humor, an ease.

1288
01:11:32,868 --> 01:11:35,788
But I made him smarter. Sharper.

1289
01:11:35,829 --> 01:11:39,459
I inspired him to rise to my level.

1290
01:11:39,499 --> 01:11:43,249
I forged the man of my dreams.

1291
01:11:45,589 --> 01:11:48,509
We were happy pretending
to be other people.

1292
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:50,380
We were the happiest couple we knew.

1293
01:11:52,012 --> 01:11:55,012
And what's the point of being together
if you're not the happiest?

1294
01:11:55,682 --> 01:11:57,892
But Nick got lazy.

1295
01:11:57,934 --> 01:12:00,144
He became someone
I did not agree to marry.

1296
01:12:00,187 --> 01:12:03,357
He actually expected me
to love him unconditionally.

1297
01:12:04,024 --> 01:12:08,534
Then he dragged me, penniless,
to the navel of this great country...

1298
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:12,530
And found himself a newer,
younger, bouncier...

1299
01:12:12,574 --> 01:12:13,574
Cool girl.

1300
01:12:15,911 --> 01:12:20,081
You think I'd let him destroy me
and end up happier than ever?

1301
01:12:20,582 --> 01:12:22,252
No fucking way.

1302
01:12:22,626 --> 01:12:24,426
He doesn't get to win.

1303
01:12:34,763 --> 01:12:38,723
My cute, charming, salt-of-the-earth,
Missouri guy.

1304
01:12:41,144 --> 01:12:43,604
He needed to learn.

1305
01:12:44,314 --> 01:12:46,944
Grown-ups work for things.

1306
01:12:47,484 --> 01:12:49,444
Grown-ups pay.

1307
01:12:50,821 --> 01:12:53,411
Grown-ups suffer consequences.

1308
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:58,120
Wait.

1309
01:12:58,495 --> 01:13:01,295
I need 20 seconds where you
don't judge me, interrupt me...

1310
01:13:01,331 --> 01:13:02,961
Or get angry.

1311
01:13:04,418 --> 01:13:05,958
Okay.

1312
01:13:09,923 --> 01:13:11,883
Is that all the stuff
from the credit cards?

1313
01:13:11,925 --> 01:13:15,095
Where do you store goodies
for anniversary five?

1314
01:13:15,137 --> 01:13:15,927
Wood.

1315
01:13:15,971 --> 01:13:19,101
- Woodshed.
- Yeah, my woodshed.

1316
01:13:19,141 --> 01:13:21,641
That fucking bitch.

1317
01:13:23,478 --> 01:13:24,808
- I thought...
- it's all right.

1318
01:13:24,855 --> 01:13:26,315
I would have, too.

1319
01:13:29,776 --> 01:13:30,976
What's that present?

1320
01:13:31,028 --> 01:13:32,778
I don't know.

1321
01:13:32,821 --> 01:13:34,781
Let's find out.

1322
01:13:41,371 --> 01:13:45,291
"Dear husband, I know you think
you're moving through this world unseen.

1323
01:13:45,334 --> 01:13:46,754
"Don't believe that for a second.

1324
01:13:46,793 --> 01:13:49,074
"I know where you've been,
and I know where you're going."

1325
01:13:52,299 --> 01:13:54,339
"For this anniversary,
I've arranged a trip.

1326
01:13:54,384 --> 01:13:56,264
"Follow the river, up, up, up.

1327
01:13:56,303 --> 01:13:59,013
"Sit back and relax,
because you are done."

1328
01:13:59,056 --> 01:14:00,476
What's "up, up river"?

1329
01:14:00,515 --> 01:14:02,685
"Up the river." Prison.

1330
01:14:02,726 --> 01:14:04,646
Fucking crazy bitch.

1331
01:14:04,686 --> 01:14:06,306
That's what this is.

1332
01:14:06,355 --> 01:14:08,655
She's framing me for her murder.

1333
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:09,980
You married a complete psychopath.

1334
01:14:10,025 --> 01:14:12,155
The morning of our anniversary...

1335
01:14:12,194 --> 01:14:16,494
I was gonna ask her for a divorce.
I just couldn't do it.

1336
01:14:16,531 --> 01:14:18,991
I couldn't fake it for another year,
another day.

1337
01:14:19,034 --> 01:14:19,954
Then what happened?

1338
01:14:19,993 --> 01:14:21,293
Before I could say anything, she said...

1339
01:14:21,328 --> 01:14:24,708
"I need you to go somewhere
and really think about our marriage."

1340
01:14:24,748 --> 01:14:25,998
She knew I would go to Sawyer beach.

1341
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:27,331
So you'd have no alibi.

1342
01:14:27,376 --> 01:14:29,596
She stage-managed me.

1343
01:14:29,878 --> 01:14:33,548
She knew exactly what I would do.
And I fucking did it.

1344
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:35,130
I went to the beach,
I thought about our marriage.

1345
01:14:35,175 --> 01:14:36,885
I came back
and decided I wanted a divorce.

1346
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,167
And by the time you got home...

1347
01:14:38,178 --> 01:14:39,718
she was gone.

1348
01:14:40,347 --> 01:14:41,217
You fuck!

1349
01:14:41,264 --> 01:14:42,854
She's good.

1350
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:45,850
Part of me was relieved...

1351
01:14:45,894 --> 01:14:48,194
When I thought she was gone.

1352
01:14:52,567 --> 01:14:54,277
Punch and Judy puppets.

1353
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,370
Remember, he beats Judy to death
and kills that baby.

1354
01:15:00,409 --> 01:15:01,529
So I'm punch.

1355
01:15:02,536 --> 01:15:04,546
We already knew that, Amy,
what's your point?

1356
01:15:05,706 --> 01:15:08,546
Does Missouri have the death penalty?

1357
01:15:35,444 --> 01:15:36,864
Hey, neighbor.

1358
01:15:37,779 --> 01:15:40,159
It's been weeks
since I had anyone decent next door.

1359
01:15:40,782 --> 01:15:43,412
Well, I don't know how decent I feel.

1360
01:15:43,452 --> 01:15:46,582
As long as you don't own a python
and blast death metal at 4 am...

1361
01:15:46,621 --> 01:15:48,621
We're gonna be best friends.

1362
01:15:48,665 --> 01:15:50,755
All right. Nice meeting you.

1363
01:15:50,792 --> 01:15:52,382
I'm greta.

1364
01:15:53,003 --> 01:15:54,293
I'm Nancy.

1365
01:15:54,338 --> 01:15:56,298
Are you going to the marina?
I could use some creamer.

1366
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:57,760
I'm sorry. I can't.

1367
01:15:57,799 --> 01:15:59,009
I've got work to do.

1368
01:15:59,301 --> 01:16:01,341
All right. See you around!

1369
01:16:01,636 --> 01:16:03,546
You will.

1370
01:16:49,518 --> 01:16:54,728
Come on.
Show me that darling Nicky smile.

1371
01:16:56,525 --> 01:16:58,405
You asshole.

1372
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:15,385
Hey.

1373
01:17:18,171 --> 01:17:19,921
Nancy.

1374
01:17:22,217 --> 01:17:24,047
Nancy.

1375
01:17:25,053 --> 01:17:27,263
It's hot again today.

1376
01:17:29,558 --> 01:17:31,388
So, where are you from?

1377
01:17:31,893 --> 01:17:33,063
Let me guess.

1378
01:17:36,189 --> 01:17:37,189
Nebraska.

1379
01:17:39,401 --> 01:17:40,611
New Orleans.

1380
01:17:44,072 --> 01:17:46,572
You know, I am an expert oiler.

1381
01:17:46,616 --> 01:17:48,406
Oh, I just bet you are.

1382
01:17:48,452 --> 01:17:51,082
Lotions and balms. Ointment.

1383
01:17:51,788 --> 01:17:53,708
I would hate
for y'all to get tan lines.

1384
01:17:53,749 --> 01:17:55,749
So sweet.

1385
01:17:56,585 --> 01:17:59,255
Okay. You know where I'll be.

1386
01:18:02,132 --> 01:18:04,552
I see we have the same taste in men.

1387
01:18:06,261 --> 01:18:08,511
I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.

1388
01:18:08,555 --> 01:18:11,605
Least you could do
is not keep his secrets for him.

1389
01:18:12,642 --> 01:18:14,022
Let me guess.

1390
01:18:14,061 --> 01:18:17,941
He's trying to watch the big game
and you just won't shut up.

1391
01:18:18,231 --> 01:18:21,071
No, you don't seem
like much of a talker.

1392
01:18:21,109 --> 01:18:22,109
I got it.

1393
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:24,570
You caught your boy rubbing up
on some hot little skank...

1394
01:18:24,613 --> 01:18:26,613
And he apologized to you
by busting you a good one.

1395
01:18:28,992 --> 01:18:29,992
Worse.

1396
01:18:30,118 --> 01:18:31,118
Worse?

1397
01:18:31,953 --> 01:18:35,663
I went to the bar where he works
to surprise him.

1398
01:18:35,707 --> 01:18:40,417
And out he comes with this girl
who had no business being in a bar.

1399
01:18:43,382 --> 01:18:45,382
On the very first night that we met...

1400
01:18:45,634 --> 01:18:49,804
We walked by a bakery
that was having their sugar delivered.

1401
01:18:50,639 --> 01:18:53,019
And it was in the air, everywhere.

1402
01:18:53,058 --> 01:18:55,348
A sugar storm.

1403
01:18:55,394 --> 01:18:57,524
And before he kissed me...

1404
01:18:57,562 --> 01:18:59,652
He leaned in...

1405
01:19:01,149 --> 01:19:03,439
And did this.

1406
01:19:14,121 --> 01:19:16,581
- And guess what.
- What?

1407
01:19:16,623 --> 01:19:18,333
He did the exact same thing with her.

1408
01:19:22,587 --> 01:19:25,587
That is the most disgusting thing
I ever heard.

1409
01:19:25,632 --> 01:19:27,342
Thank you.

1410
01:19:42,107 --> 01:19:43,687
Thanks very much.

1411
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:52,780
Well, we've gone mainstream.

1412
01:20:08,383 --> 01:20:11,513
It's an appeals process,
so we will attempt to appeal to them.

1413
01:20:11,553 --> 01:20:13,683
Mr. bolt. Tanner bolt?

1414
01:20:15,557 --> 01:20:16,967
Nick dunne.

1415
01:20:17,017 --> 01:20:19,307
I have been sitting by the phone,
my friend.

1416
01:20:22,773 --> 01:20:24,023
I'm sorry.

1417
01:20:24,066 --> 01:20:25,906
Do you not believe me?

1418
01:20:25,942 --> 01:20:29,192
No, I believe you. It's just the
craziest thing I've ever heard.

1419
01:20:29,237 --> 01:20:32,567
I love it. But, for you, it sucks.

1420
01:20:33,283 --> 01:20:36,583
But you gotta have a grudging respect
for your wife at this point, right?

1421
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:38,200
- Are you laughing me out of the building?
- No!

1422
01:20:38,246 --> 01:20:39,996
Are you kidding me? I'm in.

1423
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,500
I'm way in.

1424
01:20:41,541 --> 01:20:44,171
You came to the right guy.
This is what I do, Nick.

1425
01:20:44,211 --> 01:20:47,631
This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.
I win the unwinnable cases.

1426
01:20:47,673 --> 01:20:49,343
$100,000?

1427
01:20:49,383 --> 01:20:50,923
We'll figure something out.

1428
01:20:50,967 --> 01:20:52,007
I'll give you a special...

1429
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:54,930
"My wife is skilled
in the art of vengeance" rate.

1430
01:20:54,971 --> 01:20:56,011
Okay.

1431
01:20:56,056 --> 01:20:57,686
So, what's the plan?

1432
01:20:57,724 --> 01:20:59,604
Well, right now,
it's a "he said, she said."

1433
01:20:59,643 --> 01:21:02,103
- She's telling a better story.
- No, Nick.

1434
01:21:02,145 --> 01:21:03,985
She is telling the perfect story.

1435
01:21:04,272 --> 01:21:07,572
So, we need to start today
to prepare your defense, should we need it.

1436
01:21:07,609 --> 01:21:10,009
- And if we decide to go with your version of...
- the truth.

1437
01:21:10,904 --> 01:21:14,244
Then we'll need to realign
the public's perception of Amy.

1438
01:21:14,282 --> 01:21:16,532
Make them stop seeing her
as America's sweetheart...

1439
01:21:16,576 --> 01:21:19,906
And see her for what she is,
which a mind-fucker of the first degree.

1440
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:24,290
Now, that is a huge realignment.
We'll need other voices besides yours.

1441
01:21:24,334 --> 01:21:26,594
There has to be someone out there
that she's screwed with in the past.

1442
01:21:26,628 --> 01:21:29,708
There's a New York guy.
O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.

1443
01:21:29,756 --> 01:21:32,126
Eight years ago,
she pressed charges against him.

1444
01:21:32,175 --> 01:21:34,345
That should be easy to find.

1445
01:21:34,886 --> 01:21:38,256
Ex-classmate, desi collings.

1446
01:21:38,306 --> 01:21:40,186
She said that he stalked her.
He's in St. Louis.

1447
01:21:41,476 --> 01:21:43,726
You go talk to Tommy,
and I'll draw up the contract.

1448
01:21:48,025 --> 01:21:51,035
I told you, you came to the right guy.

1449
01:21:53,238 --> 01:21:54,448
Apparently.

1450
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:05,288
Tommy?

1451
01:22:05,334 --> 01:22:06,884
Yeah.

1452
01:22:07,294 --> 01:22:09,254
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1453
01:22:12,341 --> 01:22:14,051
You're gonna want a drink.

1454
01:22:14,593 --> 01:22:15,933
Yeah.

1455
01:22:15,969 --> 01:22:18,759
So, she said you got physical with her.

1456
01:22:18,805 --> 01:22:21,775
No, dude, she said I raped her.

1457
01:22:21,808 --> 01:22:24,178
First degree, felony rape.

1458
01:22:24,936 --> 01:22:26,646
- Did you do it?
- Did you do it?

1459
01:22:27,814 --> 01:22:29,904
I was looking at 30 years to life.

1460
01:22:30,442 --> 01:22:31,982
- Did you get a trial?
- Fuck, no.

1461
01:22:32,027 --> 01:22:34,237
Do I look like
I would do well in the yard?

1462
01:22:34,279 --> 01:22:37,199
I pled down, man.
Sexual assault one, no jail time.

1463
01:22:37,616 --> 01:22:39,286
- That's something.
- Oh, yeah.

1464
01:22:39,326 --> 01:22:40,746
I've been unemployed
for the last eight years...

1465
01:22:40,786 --> 01:22:43,296
Because I have to write "sexual offender"
on every job application.

1466
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:46,290
I'm on a neighborhood watch list,
because I have to register as a predator.

1467
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:49,673
I haven't had a date in almost a decade,
because if a girl googles me...

1468
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:53,550
Could you walk me through what happened?

1469
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,970
I meet Amy at this party, you know?

1470
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:58,640
We click. She's perfect.

1471
01:22:58,679 --> 01:23:01,009
She's beautiful,
she's smart, she's well-read...

1472
01:23:01,056 --> 01:23:03,356
She's got an ass
like a 20-year-old stripper.

1473
01:23:03,392 --> 01:23:05,182
I think, "what's the catch?"

1474
01:23:05,227 --> 01:23:08,397
A few months, it hits me.
This is not going to be easy.

1475
01:23:09,064 --> 01:23:12,114
Girls like a fixer-upper, but Amy?

1476
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:15,610
She annexed me.
She made me her business.

1477
01:23:15,654 --> 01:23:19,454
It was just too much.
She went out and bought me ties.

1478
01:23:19,491 --> 01:23:21,701
And we must have gone
20 rounds over that.

1479
01:23:21,743 --> 01:23:24,503
Ties. The whole thing just became...

1480
01:23:24,538 --> 01:23:28,328
- so, you broke up with her.
- No, I just backed away.

1481
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:31,175
Gave her some space. No big deal, right?

1482
01:23:31,211 --> 01:23:32,881
So I thought.

1483
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:35,211
Then one night,
Amy comes over to my place...

1484
01:23:35,257 --> 01:23:38,177
With a bottle of bourbon
and a bootleg of this band I love.

1485
01:23:38,218 --> 01:23:41,218
And within two minutes,
she's got my pants around my ankles...

1486
01:23:41,263 --> 01:23:42,853
And she is kneeling down, and...

1487
01:23:42,889 --> 01:23:44,889
I'm sorry. I know it's your wife.

1488
01:23:44,933 --> 01:23:46,813
- You had sex?
- Yeah, consensual.

1489
01:23:46,852 --> 01:23:48,942
It was rough,
but she was screaming for it.

1490
01:23:49,396 --> 01:23:51,736
Next morning,
there's two cops at my door.

1491
01:23:52,065 --> 01:23:54,985
Amy has wounds
that are consistent with rape.

1492
01:23:55,027 --> 01:23:58,197
Ligature marks on her wrist,
and my semen.

1493
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:01,908
It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed,
and raped her.

1494
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:03,410
Me!

1495
01:24:03,452 --> 01:24:05,202
And then, guess what they find.

1496
01:24:05,245 --> 01:24:07,295
Headboards of my bed, one on each side.

1497
01:24:07,706 --> 01:24:09,046
The ties you wouldn't wear.

1498
01:24:09,082 --> 01:24:10,422
You do know your wife.

1499
01:24:11,084 --> 01:24:12,924
- Did you ever see her again?
- Yeah.

1500
01:24:12,961 --> 01:24:14,381
On TV, last week, with you.

1501
01:24:14,963 --> 01:24:16,383
I thought, "there's Amy.

1502
01:24:16,423 --> 01:24:20,433
"She's graduated from being raped
to being murdered."

1503
01:24:24,264 --> 01:24:25,434
You been watching this, too?

1504
01:24:25,474 --> 01:24:26,684
Last night's bombshell.

1505
01:24:26,725 --> 01:24:27,775
We just found out...

1506
01:24:27,809 --> 01:24:30,639
Amy elliott dunne was, indeed,
pregnant when she went missing.

1507
01:24:31,146 --> 01:24:34,116
Kelly capitono,
this makes me wanna throw up.

1508
01:24:34,149 --> 01:24:37,109
What is it about a pregnant woman,
a woman carrying life inside her...

1509
01:24:37,152 --> 01:24:38,612
That turns men into animals?

1510
01:24:38,653 --> 01:24:40,153
Ellen, this is an epidemic.

1511
01:24:40,447 --> 01:24:42,697
The third leading cause of death
among pregnant women...

1512
01:24:42,741 --> 01:24:45,121
Is homicide committed by
a boyfriend or husband.

1513
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:48,040
Let's not forget about the wife, ever.

1514
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:52,120
Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend,
noelle hawthorne.

1515
01:24:52,167 --> 01:24:54,537
Thanks for being on the show, noelle.

1516
01:24:54,586 --> 01:24:55,876
Thank you, Ellen.

1517
01:24:55,921 --> 01:24:57,421
And let me just say this...

1518
01:24:57,464 --> 01:25:01,054
Amy would have loved you,
and all you do for women.

1519
01:25:01,093 --> 01:25:02,133
Oh, that's nice.

1520
01:25:02,177 --> 01:25:04,297
Why don't you tell us
about your friend, noelle?

1521
01:25:04,346 --> 01:25:06,896
Amy was so nurturing.

1522
01:25:06,932 --> 01:25:09,312
Oh, I'd love if just once,
someone was like...

1523
01:25:09,351 --> 01:25:10,641
"She was a real rag."

1524
01:25:13,146 --> 01:25:15,726
She was beautiful and smart and kind.

1525
01:25:15,774 --> 01:25:17,824
Seems like a rich bitch to me.

1526
01:25:17,859 --> 01:25:20,489
What do you mean? People love her.

1527
01:25:20,529 --> 01:25:22,949
I don't know. She seems uppity.

1528
01:25:24,658 --> 01:25:27,158
Spoiled rich girl,
married a cheating asshole.

1529
01:25:27,202 --> 01:25:28,412
Paid the ultimate price.

1530
01:25:28,453 --> 01:25:31,913
The only secret was her husband.
We never met Nick.

1531
01:25:31,957 --> 01:25:33,577
He never introduced himself.

1532
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:36,005
Why was that, noelle? Why do you think?

1533
01:25:36,044 --> 01:25:37,044
I think we know why.

1534
01:25:37,838 --> 01:25:40,088
Because he had a violent temper.

1535
01:25:40,132 --> 01:25:41,172
A little harsh.

1536
01:25:41,216 --> 01:25:42,796
That's life, baby.

1537
01:25:42,843 --> 01:25:44,403
He knew I'd have
seen right through him.

1538
01:25:45,345 --> 01:25:46,685
Don't get me wrong.

1539
01:25:46,722 --> 01:25:48,602
I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.

1540
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:52,060
I'm just saying, there are consequences.

1541
01:25:54,187 --> 01:25:55,187
Fuck, yeah.

1542
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:57,650
She was so alone.

1543
01:25:57,691 --> 01:25:59,611
And she was so innocent.

1544
01:25:59,651 --> 01:26:03,111
You're a good friend, noelle.
And you're a good friend of the show.

1545
01:26:03,155 --> 01:26:04,365
Thanks for coming on.

1546
01:26:04,406 --> 01:26:05,866
Please tell me you landed Tanner bolt.

1547
01:26:05,907 --> 01:26:08,197
Tanner bolt landed me.

1548
01:26:08,243 --> 01:26:11,543
I'm gonna try and see desi collings
on my way home.

1549
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:13,540
And, go...

1550
01:26:13,582 --> 01:26:16,752
Tanner's retainer is $100,000.

1551
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:18,670
That's just the retainer.

1552
01:26:19,046 --> 01:26:22,676
Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.
I've got $2,500 in an ira.

1553
01:26:22,716 --> 01:26:25,806
I'm approved for a second mortgage
on the house. We will go from there.

1554
01:26:25,844 --> 01:26:27,594
Thank you.

1555
01:26:28,347 --> 01:26:30,007
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1556
01:26:30,057 --> 01:26:32,807
Nick keeps his father,
who has Alzheimer's, in a facility.

1557
01:26:32,851 --> 01:26:35,061
Number of times he visited last year?
One.

1558
01:26:35,103 --> 01:26:36,103
Oh, fuck!

1559
01:26:36,104 --> 01:26:38,814
His twin sister, margo,
well, she is a peach.

1560
01:26:38,857 --> 01:26:41,187
These two spend their days
in the bar Amy bought them.

1561
01:26:41,777 --> 01:26:43,897
Playing what, Lauren? Playing house?

1562
01:26:43,945 --> 01:26:45,075
What the fuck?

1563
01:26:45,113 --> 01:26:47,783
Twin siblings often enable and abet.

1564
01:26:48,283 --> 01:26:50,123
While I never examined Nick,
or his sister...

1565
01:26:50,911 --> 01:26:53,041
They both seem very, very close.

1566
01:26:53,372 --> 01:26:54,622
It's twin-cest.

1567
01:26:54,956 --> 01:26:57,666
Disturbingly close, Lauren.

1568
01:26:57,709 --> 01:26:59,709
And so, we close with a question.

1569
01:26:59,753 --> 01:27:01,253
What kind of moral rot...

1570
01:27:01,296 --> 01:27:06,006
Allows a beautiful, talented,
kind, smart, loving mother...

1571
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:09,761
To vanish without
the heavens hearing our outraged cries?

1572
01:27:09,805 --> 01:27:10,855
Can I bum a cigarette?

1573
01:27:10,889 --> 01:27:14,639
Amy elliott dunne, we care about you,
and we will not forget.

1574
01:27:15,143 --> 01:27:17,353
And you know what else we won't forget?

1575
01:27:17,396 --> 01:27:19,776
Missouri has the death penalty.

1576
01:27:19,815 --> 01:27:20,985
Amen.

1577
01:27:46,842 --> 01:27:49,132
I'd like to report
some strange activity...

1578
01:27:49,177 --> 01:27:52,677
Near the woodshed
on the property of one margo dunne.

1579
01:28:33,889 --> 01:28:35,349
Hey.

1580
01:28:40,896 --> 01:28:43,026
- Mr. dunne.
- Mr. collings.

1581
01:28:44,024 --> 01:28:47,114
I know you.
I saw you at the volunteer center.

1582
01:28:47,152 --> 01:28:48,862
I wanted to help.

1583
01:28:49,654 --> 01:28:51,364
I hope you don't mind me coming by.

1584
01:28:51,406 --> 01:28:54,486
I got your address from this letter
that you wrote my wife.

1585
01:28:55,369 --> 01:28:58,869
Amy and I believe
in the lost art of letter-writing.

1586
01:28:58,914 --> 01:29:02,754
I always wondered
why you kept in touch after...

1587
01:29:03,418 --> 01:29:04,708
Everything.

1588
01:29:04,753 --> 01:29:07,173
You were together for two years
in boarding school, right?

1589
01:29:07,214 --> 01:29:09,384
She was my first serious girlfriend.

1590
01:29:09,424 --> 01:29:12,224
- Why did you break up?
- That's a strange question.

1591
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:14,220
Did you treat her bad?
Did you cheat on her?

1592
01:29:14,262 --> 01:29:15,472
That's a rude question.

1593
01:29:15,514 --> 01:29:17,224
Let me tell you what Amy told me.

1594
01:29:17,265 --> 01:29:20,235
She dumped you,
you completely unraveled.

1595
01:29:20,268 --> 01:29:22,348
You stalked her, you threatened her...

1596
01:29:22,396 --> 01:29:25,906
And you attempted suicide in her bed
and were institutionalized.

1597
01:29:25,941 --> 01:29:29,861
Your wife is missing,
and you came all this way to tell me this?

1598
01:29:29,903 --> 01:29:32,113
I thought there might be
another side to this story.

1599
01:29:35,784 --> 01:29:37,624
Mr. collings.

1600
01:29:39,705 --> 01:29:41,625
Fuck.

1601
01:29:47,254 --> 01:29:50,264
...the missing persons case
of Amy elliott dunne.

1602
01:29:50,298 --> 01:29:53,968
She is the beautiful blonde inspiration
for the amazing Amy kids' book series.

1603
01:30:11,153 --> 01:30:13,363
You're reading that diary again?

1604
01:30:13,405 --> 01:30:14,455
You know how it ends.

1605
01:30:14,489 --> 01:30:16,949
It interests me.

1606
01:30:16,992 --> 01:30:18,582
Hey, Rhonda.

1607
01:30:18,618 --> 01:30:20,538
"He's gonna kill me." The end.

1608
01:30:20,579 --> 01:30:22,699
Why did he go to his dad's house
to burn it?

1609
01:30:22,748 --> 01:30:23,868
It's private. There's no one there.

1610
01:30:23,915 --> 01:30:26,715
Why didn't he make sure
it actually burned?

1611
01:30:26,752 --> 01:30:29,712
Because he tripped the alarm.
You were up his ass with a flashlight.

1612
01:30:29,755 --> 01:30:32,095
The whole thing just feels hinky.

1613
01:30:32,132 --> 01:30:34,222
Like finding an envelope marked "clue."

1614
01:30:34,259 --> 01:30:35,379
You ever hear the expression...

1615
01:30:35,427 --> 01:30:37,267
"The simplest answer
is often the correct one"?

1616
01:30:37,971 --> 01:30:39,971
Actually, I've never
found that to be true.

1617
01:30:40,015 --> 01:30:41,815
- Good night.
- Good night.

1618
01:30:44,478 --> 01:30:45,478
Hey.

1619
01:30:54,946 --> 01:30:56,816
Elvis is in Missouri.

1620
01:30:56,865 --> 01:30:58,995
Thank God. Come on in.

1621
01:30:59,034 --> 01:31:01,914
First thing you have to understand
about Amy, she loves to teach lessons.

1622
01:31:02,037 --> 01:31:04,497
- Play God.
- Yeah, old testament God.

1623
01:31:04,539 --> 01:31:05,579
Okay. Keep talking.

1624
01:31:05,624 --> 01:31:07,334
She finds out I've been cheating on her
with Andie...

1625
01:31:07,376 --> 01:31:08,966
Decides to teach me a lesson.

1626
01:31:09,002 --> 01:31:10,922
Fakes her own death, frames me for it.

1627
01:31:10,962 --> 01:31:13,172
Blood in the house, credit cards,
life insurance.

1628
01:31:13,215 --> 01:31:14,425
She does the treasure hunt.

1629
01:31:14,466 --> 01:31:15,806
Now, the treasure hunt is critical.

1630
01:31:15,842 --> 01:31:19,512
She's taking us on a tour of my
infidelities. Rubbing my nose in it.

1631
01:31:19,554 --> 01:31:21,604
And she leaves clue number one
for the police...

1632
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,350
Which will lead them
back to my office...

1633
01:31:23,392 --> 01:31:25,932
Which is a place
where Andie and I would often...

1634
01:31:25,977 --> 01:31:27,307
And she leaves a pair of red panties.

1635
01:31:27,354 --> 01:31:28,524
Right. Racy, looks bad.

1636
01:31:28,563 --> 01:31:30,273
- Clue two.
- My father's house.

1637
01:31:30,315 --> 01:31:32,695
Another place where Andie and I
would occasionally have relations.

1638
01:31:32,734 --> 01:31:34,114
- Clue three?
- Woodshed.

1639
01:31:34,152 --> 01:31:35,652
- Also a location...
- Oh, my God.

1640
01:31:35,696 --> 01:31:37,456
- We had limited options.
- A hotel.

1641
01:31:37,489 --> 01:31:39,989
- Amy would have seen the credit card bill.
- Put it on Andie's credit card.

1642
01:31:40,033 --> 01:31:41,373
Andie's statement
went right to her parents.

1643
01:31:41,410 --> 01:31:43,950
Nick, margo, can we head over
to the little brown house?

1644
01:31:43,996 --> 01:31:45,796
- This leads us to what?
- My dad's house.

1645
01:31:45,831 --> 01:31:47,581
Dad's house is blue.

1646
01:31:48,875 --> 01:31:51,925
After the divorce,
when dad wasn't coming around...

1647
01:31:52,254 --> 01:31:56,514
I used to pretend that he was a spy
named Mr. brown, who...

1648
01:31:56,550 --> 01:32:00,220
For the sake of his children's safety,
had to deny their existence.

1649
01:32:00,262 --> 01:32:01,682
You never told me that.

1650
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:03,720
You told her that?

1651
01:32:03,765 --> 01:32:06,065
We've got incriminating red panties
in your office.

1652
01:32:06,393 --> 01:32:08,793
We've got a showcase showdown
worth of crap in your woodshed.

1653
01:32:09,896 --> 01:32:13,226
So, what in God's name
is at your father's house, Nick?

1654
01:32:13,275 --> 01:32:14,365
And be honest.

1655
01:32:14,401 --> 01:32:16,241
I honestly have no idea.

1656
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:27,120
Whatever they found, I think it's
safe to assume that it's very bad.

1657
01:32:28,957 --> 01:32:31,207
We got a lot of uncontained issues here.

1658
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:34,550
Nick, do you have any idea
as to what Andie's mindset is?

1659
01:32:35,756 --> 01:32:37,556
We haven't communicated since the vigil.

1660
01:32:37,591 --> 01:32:38,921
Okay. Amy's parents?

1661
01:32:38,967 --> 01:32:40,547
- No, it's...
- More pressure.

1662
01:32:40,594 --> 01:32:43,854
We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will
no doubt go public at any moment.

1663
01:32:43,889 --> 01:32:45,389
- No, Andie won't do that.
- She will.

1664
01:32:45,432 --> 01:32:47,142
They always do.
Don't take it personally.

1665
01:32:47,642 --> 01:32:49,812
Amy's got us in an interesting bind.

1666
01:32:50,145 --> 01:32:52,445
- We need to tell the cops about Andie.
- Really?

1667
01:32:52,481 --> 01:32:54,651
Right now,
Andie just gives you another motive.

1668
01:32:55,484 --> 01:32:56,654
We need to tell the cops
about the woodshed.

1669
01:32:56,943 --> 01:32:58,363
We need to be on the front end of that.

1670
01:32:58,403 --> 01:33:00,743
But I'm gonna warn you
as to what will happen.

1671
01:33:01,323 --> 01:33:02,533
They'll go after margo.

1672
01:33:02,574 --> 01:33:03,574
They can't do that, can they?

1673
01:33:03,617 --> 01:33:05,527
She's your accomplice.
She helped you hide the evidence.

1674
01:33:05,577 --> 01:33:07,657
In all likelihood,
she knows that you killed Amy.

1675
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:10,000
God.

1676
01:33:10,332 --> 01:33:12,422
Well, what are we going to do?

1677
01:33:12,459 --> 01:33:13,459
We find Amy.

1678
01:33:13,752 --> 01:33:16,092
No. Any other strategy
is missing the point.

1679
01:33:16,129 --> 01:33:18,459
I've got two ex-secret service guys
that are really good.

1680
01:33:18,507 --> 01:33:20,127
I'll put them on it.

1681
01:33:20,175 --> 01:33:21,595
But where do they start, Nick?

1682
01:33:21,968 --> 01:33:23,088
Where would Amy go?

1683
01:33:25,263 --> 01:33:26,893
I have no idea.

1684
01:33:31,353 --> 01:33:33,983
Are we keeping score?

1685
01:33:34,648 --> 01:33:36,018
Hey!

1686
01:33:37,651 --> 01:33:40,821
I thought we were steering clear
of men for a while.

1687
01:33:40,862 --> 01:33:41,862
He's nice.

1688
01:33:41,863 --> 01:33:44,363
Because he wants to fuck you.

1689
01:33:45,993 --> 01:33:47,533
She's still moping about her ex?

1690
01:33:49,329 --> 01:33:51,999
He got cheated on, too.

1691
01:33:55,377 --> 01:33:58,247
We three are the
saddest sacks in all the ozarks.

1692
01:33:58,296 --> 01:33:59,836
I'm not sad.

1693
01:34:00,382 --> 01:34:01,382
I'm angry.

1694
01:34:01,383 --> 01:34:03,183
There you go.

1695
01:34:03,218 --> 01:34:05,838
I almost drank myself to death
when my wife left me.

1696
01:34:05,887 --> 01:34:08,137
I was gonna kill myself.
Can you believe that?

1697
01:34:08,181 --> 01:34:09,311
Don't give him the pleasure.

1698
01:34:09,349 --> 01:34:12,479
I was going to drown myself
in the Gulf of Mexico...

1699
01:34:12,519 --> 01:34:15,019
Let myself be dinner
for the great whites.

1700
01:34:15,063 --> 01:34:16,863
Gulf is bull sharks, miss nawlins.

1701
01:34:16,898 --> 01:34:20,818
Why should I die? I'm not the asshole.

1702
01:34:20,861 --> 01:34:23,321
Please put that on a t-shirt.

1703
01:34:31,872 --> 01:34:34,252
Miss moneybags.
I thought you said you were broke.

1704
01:34:35,751 --> 01:34:37,041
That's a fat wad.

1705
01:34:38,837 --> 01:34:40,627
It's mostly singles.

1706
01:34:40,672 --> 01:34:42,552
Singles? What are you, a stripper?

1707
01:34:43,342 --> 01:34:45,932
Swamp girls, or treasure chest?

1708
01:34:47,054 --> 01:34:48,104
We're just teasing.

1709
01:34:48,889 --> 01:34:50,679
Don't they tease people down in nola?

1710
01:34:53,101 --> 01:34:56,061
We can expect Nick dunne's arrest
any day now.

1711
01:34:56,104 --> 01:34:59,824
We've got blood in the house,
huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.

1712
01:34:59,858 --> 01:35:03,818
And we have Amy elliott dunne,
missing for five days...

1713
01:35:03,862 --> 01:35:05,992
Crying out for justice.

1714
01:35:06,782 --> 01:35:08,492
We'll be right back.

1715
01:36:00,752 --> 01:36:03,342
Tanner has a very bad idea
he's going to pitch you.

1716
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:04,170
Yeah?

1717
01:36:04,214 --> 01:36:05,804
You're doing Sharon schieber
tomorrow in St. Louis.

1718
01:36:05,841 --> 01:36:06,841
It could go so wrong.

1719
01:36:06,883 --> 01:36:08,633
And you are going
to tell her about Andie.

1720
01:36:08,677 --> 01:36:09,967
Nope.

1721
01:36:10,012 --> 01:36:12,012
That sounds like a very bad idea.

1722
01:36:12,055 --> 01:36:14,145
You haven't heard from her
in three days.

1723
01:36:14,182 --> 01:36:17,892
This is a ticking time bomb.
You've gotta throw yourself on it.

1724
01:36:17,936 --> 01:36:20,476
- People are gonna hate me.
- And then, they will forgive you.

1725
01:36:20,522 --> 01:36:22,982
A guy admitting that he's a
gigantic asshole on television?

1726
01:36:23,025 --> 01:36:24,695
People empathize with that.

1727
01:36:26,111 --> 01:36:28,031
- Why don't we just put out a statement?
- They need to see you.

1728
01:36:28,071 --> 01:36:31,161
Sharon's specials,
they get 10 million viewers.

1729
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:33,699
She is a crusader.
If she takes you on as a cause...

1730
01:36:33,744 --> 01:36:35,664
she's going to ask real questions.

1731
01:36:35,704 --> 01:36:37,544
I will drill you
as if you were doing a deposition.

1732
01:36:37,581 --> 01:36:39,041
What to say, what not to say.

1733
01:36:39,082 --> 01:36:40,212
A trained monkey?

1734
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:42,370
A trained monkey
who doesn't get the lethal injection.

1735
01:36:43,628 --> 01:36:47,088
Nick, this case
is about what people think of you.

1736
01:36:47,132 --> 01:36:48,882
They need to like you.

1737
01:36:48,925 --> 01:36:52,765
Now, you do this and you will reach
millions of those people.

1738
01:36:53,930 --> 01:36:56,430
Maybe I only need to reach one.

1739
01:37:05,901 --> 01:37:06,691
Hello?

1740
01:37:06,735 --> 01:37:07,945
Hey, baby.

1741
01:37:09,404 --> 01:37:10,994
One minute.

1742
01:37:19,748 --> 01:37:21,208
- Hey.
- Hey.

1743
01:37:21,249 --> 01:37:22,249
You clearing out?

1744
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:24,080
No, I'm just cleaning up.

1745
01:37:24,127 --> 01:37:25,707
Let us come in and say goodbye.

1746
01:37:25,754 --> 01:37:26,804
I'll come by before...

1747
01:37:26,838 --> 01:37:28,588
let us give you a hand.

1748
01:37:34,763 --> 01:37:37,223
Yeah, you gotta
clear everything out, here.

1749
01:37:38,892 --> 01:37:41,602
Dorothy is a real stickler.

1750
01:37:42,938 --> 01:37:46,228
Not even a spare hanger
can you leave behind.

1751
01:37:48,819 --> 01:37:50,419
Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside.

1752
01:37:52,906 --> 01:37:53,906
A sock...

1753
01:37:54,825 --> 01:37:57,625
Or undies or what have you.

1754
01:38:02,457 --> 01:38:03,787
You did a real good job.

1755
01:38:05,794 --> 01:38:07,924
Where is the money, sweetheart?

1756
01:38:11,591 --> 01:38:12,591
Look under her dress.

1757
01:38:14,136 --> 01:38:15,396
He talked you into this?

1758
01:38:15,429 --> 01:38:16,759
I talked him into it.

1759
01:38:16,805 --> 01:38:18,815
The second you leave,
I'm calling the cops.

1760
01:38:19,307 --> 01:38:22,977
Your glasses are fake.
Your hair's dyed all hamster.

1761
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:26,100
You say your name's Nancy, but you
don't even answer to it half the time.

1762
01:38:26,148 --> 01:38:28,608
You're hiding. I don't know why,
and I don't really care.

1763
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:30,690
But you ain't gonna call the cops.

1764
01:38:31,028 --> 01:38:33,108
And I don't think you've
ever really been hit before.

1765
01:38:39,328 --> 01:38:41,328
Holy shit.

1766
01:38:44,374 --> 01:38:47,174
Sorry, but we really need the money.

1767
01:38:47,210 --> 01:38:48,840
Next place, be more careful, okay?

1768
01:38:48,879 --> 01:38:51,239
There are a lot of people out there
a lot worse than we are.

1769
01:39:25,832 --> 01:39:27,462
Excuse me. You can't sleep here.

1770
01:39:55,070 --> 01:39:58,160
I did not kill my wife.

1771
01:39:59,157 --> 01:40:02,447
Why don't you try it again?
A little less wooden.

1772
01:40:02,494 --> 01:40:03,584
I didn't kill my wife.

1773
01:40:05,414 --> 01:40:07,124
- What are you doing?
- Every time you look smug...

1774
01:40:07,165 --> 01:40:09,835
Or annoyed or tense,
I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear.

1775
01:40:09,876 --> 01:40:11,836
- That's supposed to make me less tense?
- Let's try it again.

1776
01:40:11,878 --> 01:40:15,168
Mr. dunne, from what I understand,
you and your wife had some bumps.

1777
01:40:16,216 --> 01:40:20,176
Yeah, we had some tough years.
I lost my job.

1778
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:21,220
You both did.

1779
01:40:23,932 --> 01:40:25,812
We both lost our jobs.

1780
01:40:25,851 --> 01:40:28,391
I had to move back home
so we could take care of my mother...

1781
01:40:28,437 --> 01:40:30,977
Who was dying of cancer
and my dad, who had...

1782
01:40:31,023 --> 01:40:32,773
your dad's scorched earth.

1783
01:40:32,816 --> 01:40:34,486
Let's talk about your mom,
how close you were.

1784
01:40:34,526 --> 01:40:35,686
Go on.

1785
01:40:35,736 --> 01:40:38,246
For a while,
things had been building up.

1786
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:41,780
"Built up" implies that an explosion
is coming. No.

1787
01:40:41,825 --> 01:40:44,245
At a certain point,
we got on the wrong track.

1788
01:40:45,078 --> 01:40:46,698
I had a moment of weakness.

1789
01:40:46,747 --> 01:40:49,157
Your "moment" was over 15 months.

1790
01:40:52,961 --> 01:40:55,051
I disrespected my wife.

1791
01:40:55,714 --> 01:40:58,134
And I disrespected my marriage.

1792
01:40:58,592 --> 01:40:59,972
And I'll always regret it.

1793
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:01,549
That works.

1794
01:41:01,595 --> 01:41:04,015
Don't be afraid to play up
the dufus husband thing, Nick.

1795
01:41:04,056 --> 01:41:05,766
"I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up.

1796
01:41:05,807 --> 01:41:06,637
"Everything I do is wrong."

1797
01:41:06,683 --> 01:41:08,733
I know.
What men are supposed to do in general.

1798
01:41:10,854 --> 01:41:11,904
- Thank you.
- How do you feel?

1799
01:41:11,938 --> 01:41:15,148
I feel good.
Go, can you pass me that box, please?

1800
01:41:15,567 --> 01:41:18,187
It's Amy's 33rd birthday present
to me.

1801
01:41:18,236 --> 01:41:19,236
You hate that watch.

1802
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:21,359
No, go. I love that watch.

1803
01:41:21,406 --> 01:41:23,406
Just like I love this tie.

1804
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:26,580
Just like I love my wife.

1805
01:41:56,942 --> 01:41:58,322
It's you!

1806
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:00,360
It's you.

1807
01:42:01,196 --> 01:42:03,196
I'm sorry.

1808
01:42:03,865 --> 01:42:05,205
I'm sorry.

1809
01:42:06,118 --> 01:42:08,118
Good God.

1810
01:42:08,161 --> 01:42:09,541
Last week...

1811
01:42:10,038 --> 01:42:15,208
I threatened to leave, and he said
he'd find me and he'd kill me.

1812
01:42:15,544 --> 01:42:17,714
So, I disappeared.

1813
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,710
I lost the baby.

1814
01:42:21,216 --> 01:42:23,006
I couldn't even tell my parents.

1815
01:42:23,051 --> 01:42:26,971
I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid.

1816
01:42:27,723 --> 01:42:28,893
Well, he is looking for you.

1817
01:42:29,558 --> 01:42:31,518
He showed up on my doorstep
three days ago.

1818
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:34,060
He tracked me from my letters to you.

1819
01:42:35,188 --> 01:42:36,398
You saved them.

1820
01:42:36,982 --> 01:42:38,022
Knowing you were out there...

1821
01:42:38,066 --> 01:42:40,686
Was the only thing that's kept me going
these past few years.

1822
01:42:40,736 --> 01:42:42,116
Let's go to the police.
You can explain everything.

1823
01:42:42,154 --> 01:42:43,454
No, I can't turn up now.

1824
01:42:43,488 --> 01:42:46,568
I'd be a pariah. Everyone would hate me.

1825
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:50,700
Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?

1826
01:42:50,746 --> 01:42:52,586
He should go to prison
for what he's done.

1827
01:42:55,417 --> 01:42:57,877
I'm setting you up at my lake house.

1828
01:42:57,919 --> 01:42:58,919
It's utterly secluded.

1829
01:43:00,339 --> 01:43:02,169
Why are you so good to me?

1830
01:43:02,215 --> 01:43:03,555
You know why.

1831
01:43:03,592 --> 01:43:04,722
Excuse me.

1832
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:05,880
I know you, don't I?

1833
01:43:05,927 --> 01:43:06,717
No.

1834
01:43:06,762 --> 01:43:08,722
You're one of the nolan girls, right?

1835
01:43:08,764 --> 01:43:11,644
No, we're from winnipeg. Excuse us.

1836
01:43:11,683 --> 01:43:12,563
We should leave.

1837
01:43:12,601 --> 01:43:13,681
Just a second.

1838
01:43:14,269 --> 01:43:17,519
That was boney. I'll call her later.

1839
01:43:17,564 --> 01:43:19,444
Tanner. Nice to see you.

1840
01:43:19,733 --> 01:43:20,863
Sharon! Hi.

1841
01:43:20,901 --> 01:43:22,571
Hope this is worth my while.

1842
01:43:22,611 --> 01:43:23,741
You're gonna be very happy.

1843
01:43:24,196 --> 01:43:24,996
Sharon.

1844
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:27,240
Ms. schieber.
Thank you so much for doing this.

1845
01:43:27,282 --> 01:43:29,412
Can I get you anything to drink or eat
before we get started?

1846
01:43:29,451 --> 01:43:31,451
No, I had some gummy bears.

1847
01:43:32,537 --> 01:43:34,117
What the fuck?

1848
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:36,420
I'm sorry?

1849
01:43:36,833 --> 01:43:40,713
We have a major shocking development
in the amazing Amy disappearance.

1850
01:43:40,754 --> 01:43:42,134
We go live to that story now.

1851
01:43:42,172 --> 01:43:43,462
Oh, my God.

1852
01:43:45,634 --> 01:43:47,434
You little slut.

1853
01:43:47,469 --> 01:43:50,469
My name is Andie Fitzgerald.

1854
01:43:51,473 --> 01:43:53,143
I met Nicholas dunne...

1855
01:43:53,183 --> 01:43:56,813
When he was my creative writing teacher
at mill valley.

1856
01:43:56,853 --> 01:43:58,943
Why is she dressed like a babysitter?

1857
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:00,440
I am deeply ashamed...

1858
01:44:00,482 --> 01:44:03,612
Of having been romantically involved
with a married man.

1859
01:44:03,652 --> 01:44:05,572
The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.

1860
01:44:05,612 --> 01:44:07,612
I truly believed we were in love.

1861
01:44:07,656 --> 01:44:09,496
Now, she looks like a fucking mennonite.

1862
01:44:10,993 --> 01:44:12,453
I know that is no excuse.

1863
01:44:12,494 --> 01:44:13,794
No, it is not.

1864
01:44:13,829 --> 01:44:18,169
I do not, in my heart, believe
Nick dunne would have killed for me.

1865
01:44:18,208 --> 01:44:20,628
My prayers go out to everyone
who loves Amy.

1866
01:44:20,669 --> 01:44:23,669
I apologize for the pain
this has caused them.

1867
01:44:28,885 --> 01:44:30,845
We have loved Nick dunne like a son.

1868
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,060
That love ended today.

1869
01:44:33,348 --> 01:44:34,968
Come on, you're staring at ghosts.

1870
01:44:35,017 --> 01:44:37,677
He met our trust with lie after lie.

1871
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:39,940
We now absolutely believe...

1872
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:42,360
Nick is involved in the disappearance
of our daughter.

1873
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:44,649
Our amazing Amy.

1874
01:44:45,527 --> 01:44:47,647
This just got very exciting.

1875
01:44:48,363 --> 01:44:50,073
We need a moment.

1876
01:44:52,075 --> 01:44:53,835
We're gonna have to bow out of this.

1877
01:44:53,869 --> 01:44:55,669
- Nothing has changed.
- Everything has changed.

1878
01:44:55,704 --> 01:44:58,124
An hour ago, we were ahead of this. Now?

1879
01:44:58,165 --> 01:44:59,805
- I can handle this.
- We're on the defense.

1880
01:44:59,833 --> 01:45:01,883
This is a completely different dynamic.

1881
01:45:01,918 --> 01:45:04,668
- I can handle it.
- She's going to eat you alive.

1882
01:45:05,213 --> 01:45:06,883
Just trust me.

1883
01:45:11,261 --> 01:45:12,641
Okay.

1884
01:45:12,679 --> 01:45:13,759
Great.

1885
01:45:14,598 --> 01:45:16,058
Mic him.

1886
01:45:35,786 --> 01:45:37,586
One, two, three, four, five.

1887
01:45:43,919 --> 01:45:44,919
Thank you.

1888
01:45:46,088 --> 01:45:47,378
He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist.

1889
01:45:47,422 --> 01:45:48,422
Yeah, no kidding.

1890
01:45:53,095 --> 01:45:56,225
Roll tape. Five... four...

1891
01:45:56,264 --> 01:45:57,894
Three... two...

1892
01:46:00,102 --> 01:46:03,022
Seriously, I can't believe
how fucking good you were.

1893
01:46:03,063 --> 01:46:04,523
- Amy brings out the best in me.
- Don't.

1894
01:46:04,564 --> 01:46:07,734
Keep it together, you two.
At least for the next 24 hours.

1895
01:46:07,776 --> 01:46:10,196
People still hate you.
Women want to scratch your eyes out.

1896
01:46:10,237 --> 01:46:12,107
Andie was really good TV.

1897
01:46:12,155 --> 01:46:14,205
- She's a good person.
- Therein lies the problem.

1898
01:46:14,241 --> 01:46:15,241
Ride this out...

1899
01:46:15,283 --> 01:46:18,293
And when Sharon airs tomorrow,
we'll be looking at a whole new you.

1900
01:46:18,328 --> 01:46:19,908
But, until then...

1901
01:46:19,955 --> 01:46:21,915
Don't show your face.

1902
01:46:21,957 --> 01:46:23,787
No problem.

1903
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:41,480
Welcome.

1904
01:46:43,478 --> 01:46:45,308
Make yourself at home.

1905
01:46:45,355 --> 01:46:49,325
I've got music, satellite...

1906
01:46:49,359 --> 01:46:50,359
Netflix.

1907
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:51,440
He was her teacher!

1908
01:46:51,486 --> 01:46:52,486
Roku.

1909
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:55,530
Internet, obviously.

1910
01:46:56,116 --> 01:46:58,836
Here is a supposedly grown man...

1911
01:46:58,869 --> 01:47:02,659
if there is ever anything you have
a taste for and you can't find it...

1912
01:47:02,706 --> 01:47:04,966
Just let me know
and I will get it for you.

1913
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,130
Instead of the a-b-c's,
he taught her the birds and the bees.

1914
01:47:08,170 --> 01:47:11,090
And just think how her mother must feel
at a time like this.

1915
01:47:11,131 --> 01:47:13,131
Wine cellar's downstairs.

1916
01:47:16,595 --> 01:47:17,975
I'll get you some clothes, too.

1917
01:47:18,013 --> 01:47:21,433
Not that I don't appreciate
bait shop chic.

1918
01:47:22,601 --> 01:47:25,101
The floors are heated,
just dial to your liking.

1919
01:47:25,145 --> 01:47:28,315
There's robes and towels.
The shower has steam.

1920
01:47:28,357 --> 01:47:30,687
The bathtub has a massage cycle.

1921
01:47:32,527 --> 01:47:34,567
There's a great view,
if you're in the mood.

1922
01:47:34,613 --> 01:47:36,153
Blackout curtains if you're not.

1923
01:47:36,198 --> 01:47:38,658
The bed is savoir.

1924
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:40,950
You'll never get a better sleep.

1925
01:47:44,831 --> 01:47:47,171
This is just what I need.

1926
01:47:48,627 --> 01:47:50,537
I'm so exhausted.

1927
01:47:52,047 --> 01:47:54,207
I'll leave you to it, then.

1928
01:47:55,967 --> 01:47:58,717
Amy, I am so happy that you are here.

1929
01:47:59,721 --> 01:48:02,851
And I don't want you to worry
for one moment.

1930
01:48:02,891 --> 01:48:04,851
There are cameras everywhere.

1931
01:48:04,893 --> 01:48:07,773
The exterior, all along the grounds,
the entryway.

1932
01:48:07,813 --> 01:48:08,813
Anyone...

1933
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:11,230
Who is caught coming or going...

1934
01:48:14,486 --> 01:48:16,076
Will be recorded.

1935
01:48:17,656 --> 01:48:20,376
You are more than safe.

1936
01:48:22,327 --> 01:48:25,827
And I am not letting you get away again.

1937
01:49:11,585 --> 01:49:13,175
- Good morning!
- Don't do that!

1938
01:49:14,921 --> 01:49:16,051
I'm sorry.

1939
01:49:18,050 --> 01:49:19,550
I need to feel safe.

1940
01:49:19,885 --> 01:49:22,895
You are very safe.

1941
01:49:25,098 --> 01:49:26,718
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

1942
01:49:26,767 --> 01:49:29,477
Amy, I'm not Nick.

1943
01:49:29,519 --> 01:49:31,519
It's hard for me.

1944
01:49:34,441 --> 01:49:38,071
After so many years
under someone's thumb...

1945
01:49:40,322 --> 01:49:41,642
I know just what that feels like.

1946
01:49:42,532 --> 01:49:44,532
You were never under my thumb.

1947
01:49:45,118 --> 01:49:47,158
- On your leash.
- Never.

1948
01:49:47,204 --> 01:49:48,704
A new start.

1949
01:49:49,998 --> 01:49:51,618
Decent clothes.

1950
01:49:52,542 --> 01:49:54,792
Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.

1951
01:49:55,087 --> 01:49:56,587
There's a gym overlooking the lake.

1952
01:49:56,963 --> 01:50:00,513
The sooner you look like yourself,
the sooner you'll feel like yourself.

1953
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:03,680
I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch
Sharon schieber, and finally move on.

1954
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:06,260
I think that's something
I should watch on my own.

1955
01:50:06,682 --> 01:50:08,392
Nonsense.

1956
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:13,440
I'll be back.

1957
01:50:15,065 --> 01:50:17,235
And I am looking forward...

1958
01:50:17,275 --> 01:50:20,195
To my reunion with Amy elliott.

1959
01:50:43,385 --> 01:50:44,555
Great.

1960
01:50:45,595 --> 01:50:47,685
Good evening, I'm Sharon schieber.

1961
01:50:47,723 --> 01:50:49,353
- Tonight, exclusively...
- Hurry up.

1962
01:50:50,267 --> 01:50:54,647
A husband breaks his silence,
not just on his wife's disappearance...

1963
01:50:54,688 --> 01:50:58,478
But on his infidelity,
and all those shocking rumors.

1964
01:51:00,944 --> 01:51:02,494
Nick dunne...

1965
01:51:02,529 --> 01:51:06,029
You're probably the most hated man
in America right now.

1966
01:51:06,074 --> 01:51:08,664
I probably am.
And I probably deserve it.

1967
01:51:08,702 --> 01:51:10,292
I bought that tie.

1968
01:51:10,329 --> 01:51:12,369
Did you kill your wife, Nick?

1969
01:51:12,414 --> 01:51:15,504
I did not kill my wife.

1970
01:51:16,168 --> 01:51:17,708
I am not a murderer.

1971
01:51:17,753 --> 01:51:19,673
But you were unfaithful.

1972
01:51:19,713 --> 01:51:21,923
I was unfaithful.

1973
01:51:21,965 --> 01:51:23,635
And I am deeply ashamed.

1974
01:51:23,675 --> 01:51:26,015
And, on top of that,
you allowed Amy's parents...

1975
01:51:26,303 --> 01:51:29,053
Her friends,
all the people in your hometown...

1976
01:51:29,097 --> 01:51:34,017
Believe you were a loving husband,
desperate to find his missing wife.

1977
01:51:34,061 --> 01:51:35,941
Well, I am desperate
to find my missing wife.

1978
01:51:35,979 --> 01:51:38,979
You say that, but I'm wondering
how you expect us to believe you...

1979
01:51:39,024 --> 01:51:40,734
Now that we know you're a liar.

1980
01:51:41,026 --> 01:51:44,156
I didn't come forward with my affair...

1981
01:51:44,196 --> 01:51:47,366
Because I knew it would make me look
really, really bad.

1982
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:49,990
But I don't care about that anymore.

1983
01:51:50,035 --> 01:51:51,665
I just want to find my wife.

1984
01:51:51,703 --> 01:51:54,253
- I'm just trying to get clear...
- let me be clear.

1985
01:51:54,289 --> 01:51:58,709
Just because I am not a murderer
doesn't make me a good guy.

1986
01:51:58,752 --> 01:51:59,922
I'm not a good guy.

1987
01:52:00,337 --> 01:52:02,797
I was a bad husband to a great wife.

1988
01:52:03,173 --> 01:52:04,923
I broke the vow that I made to her.

1989
01:52:05,175 --> 01:52:07,725
Those are pretty words, Nick.

1990
01:52:08,053 --> 01:52:09,803
But what does that really mean to you?

1991
01:52:09,846 --> 01:52:11,886
It basically means
that I was a con artist.

1992
01:52:12,849 --> 01:52:16,059
I met Amy elliott seven years ago.

1993
01:52:16,103 --> 01:52:17,693
I was completely transfixed.

1994
01:52:18,146 --> 01:52:20,056
Amy can do that to you.

1995
01:52:20,107 --> 01:52:22,647
I was this average guy
from an average place...

1996
01:52:22,693 --> 01:52:24,693
With mediocre aspirations.

1997
01:52:24,736 --> 01:52:27,236
And I met a woman who dazzled me.

1998
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:29,240
And I wanted her to love me...

1999
01:52:29,282 --> 01:52:31,622
So I pretended to be better than I was.

2000
01:52:32,494 --> 01:52:36,164
When we got married,
I promised to be that guy.

2001
01:52:36,206 --> 01:52:38,036
That guy who works harder.

2002
01:52:38,083 --> 01:52:40,293
That guy who, who lives and acts...

2003
01:52:40,335 --> 01:52:43,255
And loves with as much passion
as she does.

2004
01:52:43,505 --> 01:52:44,715
But I failed her.

2005
01:52:45,632 --> 01:52:46,992
Instead of doing what was right...

2006
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:49,430
I did what was easy.

2007
01:52:50,178 --> 01:52:53,808
You talk like a man who believes
he can make amends to his wife.

2008
01:52:53,849 --> 01:52:55,469
Who believes his wife is still alive.

2009
01:52:55,517 --> 01:52:56,807
She is still alive.

2010
01:52:58,687 --> 01:53:01,517
Will you look at that camera for me?

2011
01:53:01,857 --> 01:53:04,817
Will you look in the lens...

2012
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:06,820
And talk to your wife?

2013
01:53:06,862 --> 01:53:09,952
If she is out there,
able to hear and see you tonight...

2014
01:53:09,990 --> 01:53:12,660
What would you like to say to her, Nick?

2015
01:53:16,204 --> 01:53:18,504
Amy, I love you.

2016
01:53:19,207 --> 01:53:21,997
You're the best person I've ever known.

2017
01:53:22,044 --> 01:53:26,514
And I've taken myself to the woodshed
for the way that I've treated you.

2018
01:53:26,548 --> 01:53:28,508
And if you come back, I promise...

2019
01:53:28,550 --> 01:53:31,050
I will spend every day
making it up to you.

2020
01:53:31,553 --> 01:53:35,393
I will be the man
that I promised you I would be.

2021
01:53:37,976 --> 01:53:38,976
I love you.

2022
01:53:39,895 --> 01:53:41,485
Come home.

2023
01:53:46,234 --> 01:53:47,234
Here.

2024
01:53:53,367 --> 01:53:54,987
Regardless of what you thought...

2025
01:53:55,035 --> 01:53:57,205
What does it say?

2026
01:53:57,245 --> 01:53:58,795
...I think we can all agree...

2027
01:53:58,830 --> 01:54:00,330
Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.

2028
01:54:00,374 --> 01:54:01,544
...there's more to him
than meets the eye.

2029
01:54:01,583 --> 01:54:02,703
They're going crazy for you.

2030
01:54:02,709 --> 01:54:07,209
They disliked me, they liked me,
they hated me.

2031
01:54:07,255 --> 01:54:08,885
And now they love me.

2032
01:54:08,924 --> 01:54:11,884
...a candor and an honesty
that's worthy of respect.

2033
01:54:11,927 --> 01:54:13,837
He's certainly earned mine.

2034
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:15,760
What is it?

2035
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:21,770
I'm Sharon schieber. Good night.

2036
01:54:26,692 --> 01:54:29,482
Margo dunne, this is a search warrant
for your property.

2037
01:54:29,528 --> 01:54:31,738
I usually ignore tipline calls...

2038
01:54:31,780 --> 01:54:36,370
But a neighbor was concerned about
a strange man around your woodshed.

2039
01:54:36,785 --> 01:54:37,785
Call Tanner.

2040
01:54:37,786 --> 01:54:38,956
Okay. Fuck!

2041
01:54:43,083 --> 01:54:44,543
Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.

2042
01:54:45,794 --> 01:54:46,874
Is that what this is about?

2043
01:54:48,296 --> 01:54:53,046
I have treated you more than fair
throughout this entire investigation.

2044
01:54:53,093 --> 01:54:55,393
I gave you the benefit of the doubt
over and over.

2045
01:54:55,429 --> 01:54:56,929
Every time you said something stupid...

2046
01:54:56,972 --> 01:54:59,352
I thought, "maybe he's just stupid."

2047
01:54:59,391 --> 01:55:01,931
But I was wrong.
That's what this is about.

2048
01:55:01,977 --> 01:55:03,097
Are these the clubs
you don't play golf with?

2049
01:55:03,145 --> 01:55:04,145
None of that is mine.

2050
01:55:04,438 --> 01:55:06,018
None of this was put here by me.

2051
01:55:06,064 --> 01:55:09,614
Those are nice clubs.
You got the makings of a real man cave.

2052
01:55:09,651 --> 01:55:12,781
Everything just waiting
until the wife goes away for good.

2053
01:55:12,821 --> 01:55:13,901
Nick!

2054
01:55:15,157 --> 01:55:18,077
- You can't do that!
- Of course we can.

2055
01:55:26,376 --> 01:55:28,956
Amy, it's time to move on.

2056
01:55:29,004 --> 01:55:30,714
What can I do to help?

2057
01:55:31,423 --> 01:55:32,973
I need some time to think.

2058
01:55:33,008 --> 01:55:35,508
- That's the last thing you need.
- Desi...

2059
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:38,142
twenty years,
you have kept me dangling.

2060
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:41,850
Finally, last night, you came to me,
and you chose me.

2061
01:55:42,559 --> 01:55:43,889
Follow that instinct.

2062
01:55:43,935 --> 01:55:46,355
Don't trust the instinct
that left you beaten and homeless...

2063
01:55:46,897 --> 01:55:50,067
Sleeping in your car,
fearing for your life.

2064
01:55:53,403 --> 01:55:56,113
I'm not gonna force myself on you.

2065
01:55:58,533 --> 01:56:01,203
I understand what you're saying, desi.

2066
01:56:02,454 --> 01:56:04,084
I do.

2067
01:56:07,417 --> 01:56:09,417
I've been so mistreated for so long.

2068
01:56:12,089 --> 01:56:14,969
I've forgotten how to behave.

2069
01:56:20,722 --> 01:56:23,022
I'll move in here tomorrow...

2070
01:56:23,058 --> 01:56:25,638
And we'll work it out together.

2071
01:56:27,729 --> 01:56:31,439
I just want you to be you again.

2072
01:56:39,282 --> 01:56:40,802
They only took margo to fuck with you.

2073
01:56:40,826 --> 01:56:42,536
She's not spending
another fucking second in there.

2074
01:56:42,577 --> 01:56:45,327
I'm gonna go in,
and I'm gonna tell them everything.

2075
01:56:45,998 --> 01:56:47,748
What?

2076
01:56:49,751 --> 01:56:51,381
We tell boney very little.

2077
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:53,550
Without a body,
without a murder weapon...

2078
01:56:53,588 --> 01:56:55,878
Their only hope is a confession.

2079
01:56:55,924 --> 01:56:57,884
So, you let them do all the talking.

2080
01:56:57,926 --> 01:57:00,046
That way,
we can jump-start your defense.

2081
01:57:00,095 --> 01:57:02,475
The truth is my defense.

2082
01:57:08,437 --> 01:57:09,437
Recognize these?

2083
01:57:09,438 --> 01:57:11,558
Yes.
It's Amy's anniversary present to me.

2084
01:57:11,606 --> 01:57:13,396
Was that how she told you
she was pregnant, Nick?

2085
01:57:13,442 --> 01:57:15,942
Mommy, daddy, baby,
and that made you real mad?

2086
01:57:16,445 --> 01:57:17,615
No.

2087
01:57:18,864 --> 01:57:20,984
- Recognize this?
- Never seen that before in my life.

2088
01:57:21,199 --> 01:57:24,449
It's Amy's diary.
We found this at your father's house.

2089
01:57:26,455 --> 01:57:27,755
Is this your wife's handwriting?

2090
01:57:27,789 --> 01:57:29,789
- He's not a handwriting ex...
- looks like it.

2091
01:57:29,833 --> 01:57:30,963
Our experts thought so, too.

2092
01:57:32,294 --> 01:57:34,004
Do you wanna
play a little true or false?

2093
01:57:34,755 --> 01:57:35,965
Sure.

2094
01:57:36,006 --> 01:57:40,476
"And then he brushes the sugar off my lips
so he can taste me."

2095
01:57:41,595 --> 01:57:43,605
Yeah, that's true.

2096
01:57:44,848 --> 01:57:46,848
You thought quinoa was a fish?

2097
01:57:48,143 --> 01:57:49,483
That is also true, yes.

2098
01:57:51,646 --> 01:57:53,766
She wanted to get pregnant,
you assaulted her.

2099
01:57:53,815 --> 01:57:55,825
I hit her? No, never happened.

2100
01:57:55,859 --> 01:57:57,479
- "Pushed," it says "pushed."
- Absolutely not.

2101
01:57:57,527 --> 01:57:58,607
I never touched her.

2102
01:58:01,031 --> 01:58:02,661
She tried to buy a gun.

2103
01:58:03,325 --> 01:58:05,205
I doubt that, but I don't know.

2104
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:08,250
Shall I read the last entry?

2105
01:58:08,288 --> 01:58:09,328
Sure.

2106
01:58:10,624 --> 01:58:12,754
"This man may kill me."

2107
01:58:12,793 --> 01:58:15,003
In her own words,
"this man may kill me."

2108
01:58:15,045 --> 01:58:17,175
It's kind of a convenient end note.

2109
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:25,099
For future reference...

2110
01:58:25,138 --> 01:58:27,468
The truth,
you are not a handwriting expert.

2111
01:58:27,516 --> 01:58:28,566
Okay, I know.

2112
01:58:36,983 --> 01:58:38,823
Judy's missing handle.

2113
01:58:40,362 --> 01:58:42,652
Big as a two-by-four, right?
Big as a club.

2114
01:58:42,698 --> 01:58:45,448
We found this day one,
in the fireplace in your home office.

2115
01:58:45,492 --> 01:58:48,162
We didn't know what the hell it was,
but fire in July?

2116
01:58:48,203 --> 01:58:49,043
We bagged it.

2117
01:58:49,079 --> 01:58:50,199
I've never seen that before either.

2118
01:58:50,247 --> 01:58:52,867
We just tested it.
Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick.

2119
01:58:52,916 --> 01:58:55,126
So, finally, Nicholas dunne...

2120
01:58:55,168 --> 01:58:56,788
You're under arrest
for the murder of your wife.

2121
01:58:56,837 --> 01:58:58,047
Do not say another word.

2122
01:58:58,088 --> 01:58:59,418
- What about my side?
- Nick!

2123
01:59:12,769 --> 01:59:14,229
More coffee?

2124
01:59:14,271 --> 01:59:16,061
I'd love it.

2125
01:59:18,358 --> 01:59:21,988
Remember that time we skipped school
and drove to the cape?

2126
01:59:22,029 --> 01:59:24,569
God, yeah. Lobster right from the ocean.

2127
01:59:24,614 --> 01:59:26,244
This reminds me of that.

2128
01:59:26,742 --> 01:59:28,412
Never-ending holiday.

2129
01:59:29,953 --> 01:59:32,163
You're not bored?

2130
01:59:32,205 --> 01:59:33,715
Desi, how could I be bored?

2131
01:59:33,749 --> 01:59:36,209
You can discuss
18th-century symphonies...

2132
01:59:36,251 --> 01:59:39,171
19th-century impressionists,
quote proust in French.

2133
01:59:39,546 --> 01:59:43,666
Nick's idea of culture
was a reality TV marathon...

2134
01:59:43,717 --> 01:59:45,587
With one hand down his boxers.

2135
01:59:47,596 --> 01:59:49,186
I really have to get going.

2136
01:59:49,514 --> 01:59:52,854
But I will be back
just as soon as I can.

2137
01:59:59,441 --> 02:00:00,521
My keys.

2138
02:00:05,739 --> 02:00:07,739
Thank you.

2139
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,540
That's how the kids wear it.

2140
02:01:21,356 --> 02:01:25,186
Dunne? You got one hell of a lawyer.

2141
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:29,200
Hey.

2142
02:01:29,614 --> 02:01:31,994
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Are you?

2143
02:01:32,034 --> 02:01:33,284
Yeah.

2144
02:01:33,327 --> 02:01:35,197
Let's go.

2145
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:38,249
What does this mean?

2146
02:01:38,290 --> 02:01:40,460
Well, you're out on bond.

2147
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:43,710
You can relax at home
while we prep for trial.

2148
02:01:49,217 --> 02:01:51,217
Keep your head down.

2149
02:02:06,651 --> 02:02:09,031
Tanner, is there
any fucking lead on Amy?

2150
02:02:09,071 --> 02:02:11,071
I've got two of my best guys on it.

2151
02:02:11,573 --> 02:02:13,203
She's air.

2152
02:02:15,243 --> 02:02:18,203
Come home, Amy. I dare you.

2153
02:03:15,429 --> 02:03:17,969
Mr. collings is home.

2154
02:03:18,015 --> 02:03:20,395
Hello, Mr. collings.

2155
02:03:20,434 --> 02:03:22,314
I've missed you.

2156
02:03:22,352 --> 02:03:23,982
I've been thinking...

2157
02:03:24,438 --> 02:03:26,608
I don't wanna be without you.

2158
02:03:27,315 --> 02:03:29,655
Stay with me.

2159
02:03:29,693 --> 02:03:32,653
And when all this dies down,
we'll go to Greece, like you said.

2160
02:03:32,696 --> 02:03:34,996
Octopus and scrabble?

2161
02:03:36,992 --> 02:03:39,242
How long do you think until it's done?

2162
02:03:39,286 --> 02:03:42,876
Not long. Six months for the trial.
Sentencing will be quick.

2163
02:03:43,373 --> 02:03:44,463
He'll appeal.

2164
02:03:44,499 --> 02:03:46,629
I can watch the rest overseas.

2165
02:04:04,019 --> 02:04:05,309
Go slowly.

2166
02:04:05,354 --> 02:04:06,354
But I want it.

2167
02:04:26,708 --> 02:04:28,288
Don't rush.

2168
02:04:28,335 --> 02:04:30,425
Just do it.

2169
02:04:38,887 --> 02:04:40,427
Harder.

2170
02:06:18,987 --> 02:06:22,157
You fucking bitch.

2171
02:06:30,832 --> 02:06:34,502
Don't you worry,
you're gonna have lots of babies.

2172
02:06:36,129 --> 02:06:39,629
Her wounds are consistent with rape.
There was semen present.

2173
02:06:39,675 --> 02:06:40,835
We'll make sure it's a match.

2174
02:06:40,842 --> 02:06:42,592
Yeah, it'll match.

2175
02:06:42,636 --> 02:06:45,106
Thank you very much.

2176
02:06:45,138 --> 02:06:46,638
What do you think?

2177
02:06:46,682 --> 02:06:47,972
Are we pals again?

2178
02:06:48,016 --> 02:06:51,556
Now that I know
you didn't murder your wife, yes.

2179
02:06:51,603 --> 02:06:52,603
What do you think?

2180
02:06:52,604 --> 02:06:55,524
Kidnapping? The story's insane.

2181
02:06:57,693 --> 02:07:00,153
She's on fairly heavy painkillers.

2182
02:07:00,195 --> 02:07:02,115
It's okay. I want to help.

2183
02:07:02,155 --> 02:07:03,575
Ms. dunne, I know
what you've been through...

2184
02:07:03,615 --> 02:07:05,955
So we'll keep this very brief.

2185
02:07:05,993 --> 02:07:08,373
Can you walk us through what happened?

2186
02:07:10,998 --> 02:07:13,618
That morning, the doorbell rang.

2187
02:07:14,501 --> 02:07:16,501
So normal.

2188
02:07:16,545 --> 02:07:18,385
I opened the door.

2189
02:07:19,006 --> 02:07:20,846
So strange.

2190
02:07:21,466 --> 02:07:25,086
Since high school,
he won't ever go away.

2191
02:07:25,137 --> 02:07:28,217
And I've just tried to be nice to him.

2192
02:07:28,265 --> 02:07:29,895
Answer his letters.

2193
02:07:30,142 --> 02:07:32,142
Keep him calm.

2194
02:07:33,562 --> 02:07:35,022
Oh, my God.

2195
02:07:35,647 --> 02:07:37,267
I've encouraged him.

2196
02:07:37,315 --> 02:07:39,115
You can't blame yourself.

2197
02:07:40,736 --> 02:07:42,906
He pushed inside.

2198
02:07:44,489 --> 02:07:46,529
And he grabbed me.

2199
02:07:47,242 --> 02:07:50,332
But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.

2200
02:07:50,662 --> 02:07:52,372
And he clubbed me.

2201
02:07:52,831 --> 02:07:54,251
I collapsed.

2202
02:07:54,291 --> 02:07:58,341
That club was actually the handle
to a punch and Judy puppet.

2203
02:07:58,378 --> 02:07:59,798
Right.

2204
02:08:00,714 --> 02:08:02,134
Treasure hunt.

2205
02:08:04,051 --> 02:08:06,091
I'd hidden some puppets at go's...

2206
02:08:06,136 --> 02:08:07,856
then how did desi have that handle?

2207
02:08:09,723 --> 02:08:11,643
I'd just found it.

2208
02:08:12,392 --> 02:08:14,812
It must have fallen off.

2209
02:08:16,730 --> 02:08:20,400
I was holding it when desi pushed in.
So, he got it from me.

2210
02:08:20,442 --> 02:08:21,652
About that woodshed...

2211
02:08:21,693 --> 02:08:23,363
He took me to his lake house.

2212
02:08:23,945 --> 02:08:25,655
Tied me to his bed.

2213
02:08:25,697 --> 02:08:28,237
Back to the woodshed real quick.
Real quick.

2214
02:08:28,283 --> 02:08:30,123
When you went
to place the puppets there...

2215
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:31,560
Did you notice that it was packed...

2216
02:08:31,578 --> 02:08:32,738
lots of stuff.

2217
02:08:32,788 --> 02:08:37,208
Corresponding to purchases made
on credit cards in your husband's name.

2218
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:38,750
Nick and credit cards.

2219
02:08:38,794 --> 02:08:41,344
He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.

2220
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:44,170
He hid a lot of stuff at go's.
They're very close.

2221
02:08:44,716 --> 02:08:49,046
Now, may I go back
to where I was being held prisoner...

2222
02:08:49,096 --> 02:08:51,856
By a man with a history
of mental problems?

2223
02:08:51,890 --> 02:08:52,970
Please continue, Ms. dunne.

2224
02:08:57,270 --> 02:08:59,350
Desi assaulted me that night.

2225
02:09:00,315 --> 02:09:02,155
Every night.

2226
02:09:03,276 --> 02:09:05,686
He tied me up like a dog.

2227
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:09,572
And then, he'd punish me.

2228
02:09:11,493 --> 02:09:13,543
Starve me.

2229
02:09:14,830 --> 02:09:16,750
Shave me.

2230
02:09:18,375 --> 02:09:20,335
Sodomize me.

2231
02:09:21,128 --> 02:09:22,958
There were cameras everywhere.

2232
02:09:23,005 --> 02:09:25,965
Please find this. Please find the tapes.

2233
02:09:27,634 --> 02:09:30,844
She slit his throat with a box cutter.

2234
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:34,140
How did she manage
to get a hold of a box cutter...

2235
02:09:34,182 --> 02:09:36,772
If he had her tied up the whole time?

2236
02:09:37,728 --> 02:09:39,768
Can't you just be happy
your wife is home and safe?

2237
02:09:40,564 --> 02:09:42,524
Amy, we found your diary.

2238
02:09:42,566 --> 02:09:46,656
It contains many concerning allegations
of mental and physical abuse.

2239
02:09:46,695 --> 02:09:49,575
Well, it's the ugly truth.

2240
02:09:50,407 --> 02:09:51,907
Nick didn't want a baby.

2241
02:09:53,744 --> 02:09:57,044
He has a temper. We had money problems.

2242
02:09:57,956 --> 02:09:59,076
But I love him.

2243
02:09:59,124 --> 02:10:00,874
Then why did you try to buy a gun?

2244
02:10:02,836 --> 02:10:04,916
I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.

2245
02:10:04,963 --> 02:10:06,803
If I could just clarify one thing...

2246
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:10,050
if this case had been left
in your deeply incompetent hands...

2247
02:10:10,093 --> 02:10:11,973
My husband would be on death row...

2248
02:10:12,262 --> 02:10:16,012
And I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle...

2249
02:10:16,308 --> 02:10:19,978
Ms. dunne, you've been very brave.
We're finished.

2250
02:10:20,854 --> 02:10:23,024
Now, I have to ask you...

2251
02:10:23,065 --> 02:10:25,905
Do you feel safe
going home with your husband?

2252
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:40,960
We prayed to God,
and God has answered our prayers.

2253
02:10:40,999 --> 02:10:42,369
Amy dunne is home.

2254
02:10:42,417 --> 02:10:44,497
Now, I know there are
a lot of questions and concerns...

2255
02:10:44,544 --> 02:10:46,554
But for right now, we wanna sit tight...

2256
02:10:46,588 --> 02:10:51,508
And just be thankful and grateful
for this miracle on the Mississippi.

2257
02:10:58,975 --> 02:11:00,775
Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.

2258
02:11:52,529 --> 02:11:53,739
We love you, Amy!

2259
02:11:58,368 --> 02:12:00,198
All right, you can stop pretending now.

2260
02:12:00,245 --> 02:12:01,915
I'm not pretending.

2261
02:12:02,622 --> 02:12:04,332
You were perfect.

2262
02:12:04,958 --> 02:12:07,498
The Nick I saw on TV,
that's the Nick I fell in love with.

2263
02:12:07,544 --> 02:12:10,254
You do know I was just telling you
what you wanted to hear, right?

2264
02:12:10,297 --> 02:12:12,127
That's how well you know me.

2265
02:12:12,174 --> 02:12:14,804
You know me in your marrow.

2266
02:12:15,802 --> 02:12:17,392
Okay.

2267
02:12:17,429 --> 02:12:20,759
You need to tell me
exactly what happened.

2268
02:12:22,059 --> 02:12:23,309
Take off your clothes.

2269
02:12:23,810 --> 02:12:27,020
I need to make sure
you're not wearing a wire.

2270
02:12:40,327 --> 02:12:44,327
You killed someone, Amy.
You're a murderer.

2271
02:12:44,373 --> 02:12:45,963
I'm a fighter.

2272
02:12:45,999 --> 02:12:48,459
I fought my way back to you.

2273
02:12:48,502 --> 02:12:50,342
You killed a guy.

2274
02:12:50,379 --> 02:12:52,339
You slashed his throat
with a box cutter.

2275
02:12:52,381 --> 02:12:57,051
You went on national television
and begged for me to save your life.

2276
02:12:57,636 --> 02:12:58,896
And I obliged.

2277
02:12:58,929 --> 02:13:00,389
But I want that Nick.

2278
02:13:00,722 --> 02:13:02,142
I'm leaving.

2279
02:13:02,182 --> 02:13:04,812
You really think that's smart?

2280
02:13:05,477 --> 02:13:06,477
Shampoo.

2281
02:13:09,189 --> 02:13:13,109
Wounded, raped wife battles her way
back to her husband...

2282
02:13:13,151 --> 02:13:15,031
And he deserts her.

2283
02:13:15,070 --> 02:13:16,110
They'll destroy you.

2284
02:13:16,863 --> 02:13:18,363
Neighbors will shun you.

2285
02:13:18,407 --> 02:13:22,617
And I'll make sure that no one forgets
the pain you caused me.

2286
02:13:24,705 --> 02:13:29,795
I don't want anything to do
with your groupies outside.

2287
02:13:30,377 --> 02:13:31,997
Once they go...

2288
02:13:32,879 --> 02:13:33,799
I go.

2289
02:13:33,839 --> 02:13:37,259
Give it the night. Sleep on it.

2290
02:13:54,109 --> 02:13:55,689
Was there ever a baby?

2291
02:13:55,986 --> 02:13:58,076
There can be.

2292
02:14:02,075 --> 02:14:03,085
Good night.

2293
02:14:56,004 --> 02:14:57,674
Hey, Nick!

2294
02:15:09,810 --> 02:15:11,060
Hello, handsome.

2295
02:15:14,189 --> 02:15:15,939
Crepe?

2296
02:15:16,650 --> 02:15:17,570
Sure.

2297
02:15:17,609 --> 02:15:19,319
She was his dream girl.

2298
02:15:19,361 --> 02:15:22,781
And when this spoiled, rich,
entitled little boy couldn't have her...

2299
02:15:22,823 --> 02:15:24,203
He took her.

2300
02:15:31,581 --> 02:15:32,921
You must be so proud.

2301
02:15:40,173 --> 02:15:42,173
It's been four hours.

2302
02:15:42,676 --> 02:15:45,516
Nick? Nick? What's next for you and Amy?

2303
02:15:49,683 --> 02:15:52,523
Right now, it's all about our marriage.

2304
02:15:53,353 --> 02:15:56,863
When two people love each other
and can't make that work...

2305
02:15:56,898 --> 02:15:59,318
That's the real tragedy.

2306
02:16:03,071 --> 02:16:05,111
Kiss my cheek.

2307
02:16:11,455 --> 02:16:14,255
I can't believe that fucking spider
is America's sweetheart.

2308
02:16:14,291 --> 02:16:16,501
She told me she killed desi.

2309
02:16:16,543 --> 02:16:17,883
Not self-defense. Murder.

2310
02:16:17,919 --> 02:16:19,459
- Can't we get a wire?
- That's not gonna work.

2311
02:16:19,504 --> 02:16:20,674
She told you once before.

2312
02:16:20,714 --> 02:16:23,054
Yeah, because she had me strip naked,
and stand in the shower.

2313
02:16:23,091 --> 02:16:26,341
I swear, you two are the most
fucked-up people I've ever known.

2314
02:16:26,386 --> 02:16:27,846
And I specialize in fucked-up.

2315
02:16:28,096 --> 02:16:29,926
You and Amy under the same roof?

2316
02:16:29,973 --> 02:16:31,773
You should pitch that
as reality television.

2317
02:16:32,392 --> 02:16:34,772
Amy dunne,
and the miracle on the Mississippi.

2318
02:16:34,811 --> 02:16:37,311
Nick and I have been through
some bad patches.

2319
02:16:37,356 --> 02:16:38,696
We've had our dark days.

2320
02:16:38,732 --> 02:16:40,572
But we thank you so much...

2321
02:16:41,068 --> 02:16:45,608
For supporting us in our new life together,
for forgiving Nick.

2322
02:16:45,864 --> 02:16:49,584
Really, your encouragement
means the world.

2323
02:16:49,618 --> 02:16:51,028
She's good.

2324
02:16:51,078 --> 02:16:53,658
Amazing Amy and the humbled husband.

2325
02:16:53,705 --> 02:16:55,795
The real housewives of branson.

2326
02:16:55,832 --> 02:16:56,922
Take care of this guy, will you?

2327
02:16:56,958 --> 02:16:58,558
I can't believe you're just leaving now.

2328
02:16:58,585 --> 02:17:00,135
You are not at risk anymore.

2329
02:17:00,170 --> 02:17:01,710
I'm the definition of "at risk."

2330
02:17:01,755 --> 02:17:05,885
You got a book deal, a lifetime movie,
you franchised the bar.

2331
02:17:05,926 --> 02:17:06,976
You may wanna thank her.

2332
02:17:10,013 --> 02:17:11,433
Just don't piss her off.

2333
02:17:12,265 --> 02:17:13,265
See you, guys.

2334
02:17:15,394 --> 02:17:17,064
Elvis has left Missouri.

2335
02:17:17,104 --> 02:17:18,194
She had to have made a mistake.

2336
02:17:18,230 --> 02:17:20,520
We need to check Amy's story,
piece by piece.

2337
02:17:20,565 --> 02:17:22,445
Nick, I can't do anything.

2338
02:17:22,859 --> 02:17:25,689
We had the national spotlight on us,
we stained the rug.

2339
02:17:25,737 --> 02:17:27,457
The case is with the feds now,
they're done.

2340
02:17:27,489 --> 02:17:28,529
That doesn't mean you have to be done.

2341
02:17:28,949 --> 02:17:30,739
It does.

2342
02:18:02,315 --> 02:18:03,775
What are you doing?

2343
02:18:05,694 --> 02:18:07,284
Couldn't sleep.

2344
02:18:07,320 --> 02:18:08,320
Come on...

2345
02:18:08,613 --> 02:18:10,783
Let me tuck you back in.

2346
02:18:23,462 --> 02:18:26,092
You know you can sleep with me, right?

2347
02:18:28,175 --> 02:18:30,265
Yeah, it's just...

2348
02:18:30,302 --> 02:18:31,802
I need more time.

2349
02:18:31,845 --> 02:18:35,395
I would never, ever hurt you.

2350
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:39,644
I do need you to participate, though.

2351
02:18:39,686 --> 02:18:41,846
I need you to do your part.

2352
02:18:52,157 --> 02:18:53,157
Okay.

2353
02:18:53,909 --> 02:18:56,739
Everything you have heard
about my wife...

2354
02:18:56,787 --> 02:18:58,157
Is a lie.

2355
02:18:58,205 --> 02:19:02,295
She is a calculating,
murderous psychopath.

2356
02:19:02,918 --> 02:19:04,458
And I have been complicit...

2357
02:19:04,503 --> 02:19:05,633
Nick!

2358
02:19:11,301 --> 02:19:13,471
Nick? Breakfast.

2359
02:19:13,512 --> 02:19:14,512
Honey?

2360
02:19:18,058 --> 02:19:20,518
We should hold hands.

2361
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:23,650
Not the entire time,
but on and off throughout.

2362
02:19:25,065 --> 02:19:27,275
"So, Nick, how does it feel
to have your wife back?"

2363
02:19:29,903 --> 02:19:31,783
"It's fantastic.

2364
02:19:31,822 --> 02:19:34,872
"How many people are lucky enough
to get a second chance at love?"

2365
02:19:34,908 --> 02:19:36,618
"Fantastic" is a little flippant.

2366
02:19:37,035 --> 02:19:38,165
"Amazing"?

2367
02:19:38,203 --> 02:19:41,043
I need you
to admit that you got the credit cards...

2368
02:19:41,081 --> 02:19:44,081
And that you hid all that stuff at go's
and that you pushed me.

2369
02:19:44,835 --> 02:19:47,885
I'm gonna need
those three things to feel safe.

2370
02:19:49,089 --> 02:19:50,919
You have to own this, Nick.

2371
02:19:51,717 --> 02:19:55,257
Don't worry. I know exactly what to say.

2372
02:19:56,847 --> 02:19:58,597
Nick.

2373
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:04,190
What a beautiful home.

2374
02:20:05,439 --> 02:20:08,109
I so appreciate
you giving us this time, Nick.

2375
02:20:08,150 --> 02:20:10,320
You went on national television...

2376
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:12,820
And told people that I murdered my wife.

2377
02:20:12,863 --> 02:20:14,113
I go where the story goes.

2378
02:20:14,156 --> 02:20:17,126
You implied that I had carnal relations
with my sister.

2379
02:20:17,159 --> 02:20:20,699
I didn't use the "I" word.
I said you two were "extremely close."

2380
02:20:20,746 --> 02:20:25,426
You and a panel of nitwits
diagnosed me as a sociopath.

2381
02:20:26,626 --> 02:20:28,376
Ice-breaker.

2382
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:33,880
To go with your robot dog.

2383
02:20:33,925 --> 02:20:35,975
I'll go find Amy.

2384
02:20:38,013 --> 02:20:40,103
She's downstairs.

2385
02:20:42,601 --> 02:20:44,231
- What is it?
- It's for you.

2386
02:20:44,269 --> 02:20:45,689
Open it.

2387
02:20:45,979 --> 02:20:47,729
I don't need any more gifts from you.

2388
02:20:47,773 --> 02:20:49,483
Open it.

2389
02:21:02,037 --> 02:21:03,697
I didn't touch you.

2390
02:21:03,747 --> 02:21:04,787
You didn't need to.

2391
02:21:04,831 --> 02:21:08,041
Bullshit. That notice of disposal.

2392
02:21:08,085 --> 02:21:09,595
I have that. You threw it out.

2393
02:21:09,628 --> 02:21:11,458
The notice, yes.

2394
02:21:11,838 --> 02:21:12,838
I want a blood test.

2395
02:21:13,256 --> 02:21:14,336
I want a paternity test.

2396
02:21:15,133 --> 02:21:16,473
I love tests.

2397
02:21:16,510 --> 02:21:18,340
You can teach those people
to hate me all you want.

2398
02:21:18,387 --> 02:21:21,097
I don't care. I am leaving you.

2399
02:21:23,225 --> 02:21:25,935
I won't have to teach your child
to hate you.

2400
02:21:25,977 --> 02:21:28,347
He'll do that all by himself.

2401
02:21:28,397 --> 02:21:30,267
You fucking cunt!

2402
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:34,530
I'm the cunt you married.

2403
02:21:34,569 --> 02:21:36,359
The only time you liked yourself...

2404
02:21:36,405 --> 02:21:40,075
Was when you were trying to be someone
this cunt might like.

2405
02:21:40,117 --> 02:21:43,577
I'm not a quitter. I'm that cunt.

2406
02:21:47,332 --> 02:21:50,582
I've killed for you.
Who else can say that?

2407
02:21:51,837 --> 02:21:54,377
You think you would be happy
with a nice midwestern girl?

2408
02:21:54,423 --> 02:21:57,263
No way, baby. I'm it.

2409
02:21:57,300 --> 02:22:00,720
Look, you're delusional. You're insane.

2410
02:22:00,762 --> 02:22:02,262
Why would you even want this?

2411
02:22:02,639 --> 02:22:03,719
Yes, I loved you.

2412
02:22:03,765 --> 02:22:07,235
And then all we did was resent each other,
and try to control each other.

2413
02:22:07,269 --> 02:22:08,309
And cause each other pain.

2414
02:22:08,812 --> 02:22:10,602
That's marriage.

2415
02:22:13,275 --> 02:22:15,655
Now, I'm getting ready.

2416
02:22:40,969 --> 02:22:44,049
I can't watch you play house
with that thing for the next 18 years.

2417
02:22:44,097 --> 02:22:45,757
I can't just walk away.

2418
02:22:45,807 --> 02:22:47,387
You could get custody.

2419
02:22:47,434 --> 02:22:51,314
No, I won't. And you know it.

2420
02:22:51,355 --> 02:22:53,865
It's gonna be my child.
I'm not gonna leave it.

2421
02:22:54,483 --> 02:22:56,283
You wanna stay.

2422
02:22:56,318 --> 02:23:00,238
I have a responsibility.
It's not about what I want anymore.

2423
02:23:00,280 --> 02:23:01,530
You wanna stay with her.

2424
02:23:12,167 --> 02:23:13,207
You're breaking my heart.

2425
02:23:13,669 --> 02:23:17,299
Go, you're my voice of reason.

2426
02:23:17,339 --> 02:23:19,839
I need you with me on this.

2427
02:23:19,883 --> 02:23:22,343
Of course I'm with you.

2428
02:23:24,971 --> 02:23:28,971
I was with you before we were even born.

2429
02:23:30,727 --> 02:23:33,517
We've been through the darkness.

2430
02:23:34,064 --> 02:23:37,364
We've come out, united.

2431
02:23:40,362 --> 02:23:42,532
We communicate.

2432
02:23:44,825 --> 02:23:47,335
We're honest with each other.

2433
02:23:47,369 --> 02:23:48,869
Right?

2434
02:23:50,789 --> 02:23:53,289
We're partners in crime.

2435
02:23:56,670 --> 02:23:57,670
And?

2436
02:23:59,381 --> 02:24:00,711
And?

2437
02:24:04,219 --> 02:24:06,139
We're gonna be parents.

2438
02:24:07,848 --> 02:24:09,468
My goodness!

2439
02:24:09,891 --> 02:24:11,851
- How exciting!
- Thank you.

2440
02:24:16,648 --> 02:24:19,018
"What are you thinking?"

2441
02:24:21,862 --> 02:24:24,072
"How are you feeling?"

2442
02:24:26,033 --> 02:24:28,663
"What have we done to each other?"

2443
02:24:30,245 --> 02:24:32,335
"What will we do?"

2443
02:24:33,305 --> 02:24:39,747
