01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:29,580
YES!

1074
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,000
[LAUGHING]

1075
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,130
BRAVO.

1076
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,180
THAT WAS A REALLY GREAT
EXPERIENCE.

1077
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:42,970
Tech:
CONGRATULATIONS.

1078
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,100
OK, QUIET DOWN.
LET'S CONCENTRATE.

1079
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:47,970
Chloe:
THAT WAS GOOD WORK.

1080
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:48,270
WHOO!

1081
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,310
Tech: LET'S GET
SOME CHAMPAGNE UP HERE.

1082
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,020
CONGRATULATIONS.

1083
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:54,190
Moses: BRILLIANT, CHRISTOF.
JUST BRILLIANT.

1084
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,150
Roman:
IT JUST BROKE MY HEART.

1085
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,200
WELL DONE, EVERYONE!

1086
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:04,660
BRAVO!

1087
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,010
Announcer: 1.7 BILLION
WERE THERE FOR HIS BIRTH.

1088
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:31,020
220 COUNTRIES TUNED IN
FOR HIS FIRST STEP.

1089
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,520
THE WORLD STOOD STILL
FOR THAT STOLEN KISS,

1090
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,780
AND AS HE GREW,
SO DID THE TECHNOLOGY.

1091
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:39,690
AN ENTIRE HUMAN LIFE

1092
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,950
RECORDED ON AN INTRICATE
NETWORK OF HIDDEN CAMERAS

1093
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,240
AND BROADCAST LIVE AND
UNEDITED 24 HOURS A DAY,

1094
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,120
7 DAYS A WEEK TO AN AUDIENCE
AROUND THE GLOBE.

1095
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,830
COMING TO YOU NOW
FROM SEAHAVEN ISLAND,

1096
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,040
ENCLOSED IN THE LARGEST
STUDIO EVER CONSTRUCTED,

1097
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:59,340
AND ALONG WITH
THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA,

1098
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:02,720
ONE OF ONLY 2 MANMADE STRUCTURES
VISIBLE FROM SPACE,

1099
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:06,760
NOW IN ITS 30th GREAT YEAR,

1100
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,060
IT'S...

1101
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,600
WHAT A WEEK IT'S BEEN.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU--

1102
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:17,480
I WAS ON PINS AND NEEDLES
THE ENTIRE TIME.

1103
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,780
HELLO AND GOOD EVENING.
I'M YOUR HOST MIKE MICHAELSON,

1104
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:22,440
  AND WELCOME TO  TRU-TALK,

1105
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:24,360
OUR FORUM FOR ISSUES
GROWING OUT OF THE SHOW.

1106
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:27,490
BUT TONIGHT,
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL INDEED,

1107
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:29,740
A RARE AND
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

1108
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:32,200
WITH THE SHOW'S
CONCEIVER AND CREATOR.

1109
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:35,500
SO, COME WITH US NOW AS WE
GO LIVE TO THE LUNAR ROOM

1110
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:38,790
ON THE 221st FLOOR
OF THE OMNI CAM ECHOSPHERE,

1111
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:42,460
WHERE WE'LL FIND THE WORLD'S
GREATEST TELE-VISIONARY--

1112
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:45,880
THE DESIGNER AND ARCHITECT
OF THE WORLD WITHIN A WORLD

1113
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:48,890
THAT IS SEAHAVEN ISLAND--
CHRISTOF.

1114
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:51,520
BEFORE WE BEGIN,
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU

1115
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,270
ON BEHALF OF OUR AUDIENCE
FOR GRANTING THIS INTERVIEW.

1116
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,230
WE KNOW HOW DEMANDING
YOUR SCHEDULE IS,

1117
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,560
AND WE ALL KNOW HOW JEALOUSLY
YOU GUARD YOUR PRIVACY.

1118
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,110
THIS, SIR,
IS INDEED AN HONOR.

1119
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:03,820
DON'T MENTION IT.

1120
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,200
WELL, THE CATALYST FOR
THE RECENT DRAMATIC EVENTS

1121
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,370
ON THE SHOW HAS BEEN
TRUMAN'S FATHER, KIRK,

1122
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:10,830
AND HIS ATTEMPTS
TO INFILTRATE THE SHOW.

1123
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:13,290
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT,
I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING

1124
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,670
THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME
SOMEONE FROM THE OUTSIDE

1125
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,040
HAS ATTEMPTED
TO REACH TRUMAN, IS IT?

1126
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:20,670
Christof: WE HAVE HAD
CLOSE CALLS IN THE PAST.

1127
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,550
Man: TRUMAN!
IT'S TELEVISION!

1128
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,970
YES!

1129
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:26,630
YES! I DID IT!

1130
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,090
  I'M ON  THE TRUMAN SHOW!

1131
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,720
Mike: BUT THERE'S NEVER
BEEN ANYTHING TO COMPARE

1132
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:32,310
WITH THIS MOST RECENT
BREACH IN SECURITY--

1133
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:35,520
THE FIRST INTRUDER TO BE
A FORMER CAST MEMBER.

1134
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:37,600
A DEAD ONE AT THAT.

1135
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:40,810
GOTTA SAY, WRITING KIRK
BACK IN--MASTERSTROKE.

1136
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:44,610
SINCE KIRK STARTED THIS
CRISIS IN TRUMAN'S LIFE,

1137
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:47,700
I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT ONLY HE COULD END IT.

1138
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,490
TRUMAN! TRUMAN! NO!

1139
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:51,870
[CONSTRUCTION NOISES]

1140
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:52,950
THAT'S OFF LIMITS!

1141
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,160
WHY? WHAT'S
OVER THERE?

1142
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:56,250
NOTHING. IT'S DANGEROUS.
THAT'S ALL.

1143
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:58,170
YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW
YOUR LIMITATIONS, TRUMAN.

1144
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:00,750
Mike: BUT LET'S REMIND
VIEWERS EXACTLY WHY

1145
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,170
DAD WAS WRITTEN OUT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1146
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:05,130
Christof: AS TRUMAN GREW UP,
WE WERE FORCED

1147
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,340
TO MANUFACTURE WAYS
TO KEEP HIM ON THE ISLAND.

1148
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,470
I'D LIKE TO BE
AN EXPLORER,

1149
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,180
LIKE THE GREAT
MAGELLAN.

1150
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:12,800
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

1151
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:15,890
THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING LEFT TO EXPLORE.

1152
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,390
[SNARLING]

1153
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:23,020
Christof: FINALLY, I CAME UP
WITH KIRK'S DROWNING.

1154
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:23,770
Mike: MOST EFFECTIVE.

1155
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:25,650
TRUMAN'S BEEN TERRIFIED
OF THE WATER EVER SINCE.

1156
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,950
Christof: WHEN KIRK READ
THE SYNOPSIS OF THE EPISODE,

1157
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,870
HE WAS DISAPPOINTED
TO SAY THE LEAST.

1158
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:32,530
JESUS!

1159
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:35,870
I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT CAUSED
HIM TO BREAK ONTO THE SET.

1160
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,250
BUT HOW DO YOU INTEND TO
EXPLAIN HIS 22-YEAR ABSENCE?

1161
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:42,170
AMNESIA.

1162
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:45,380
BRILLIANT. LET'S TAKE
SOME VIEWER PHONE CALLS.

1163
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,920
CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA,
YOU'RE ON WITH CHRISTOF.

1164
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:52,010
Man: UH, YEAH,
HI, CHRISTOF.

1165
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:55,350
I WAS WONDERING HOW MANY
CAMERAS YOU GOT IN THAT TOWN.

1166
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:57,970
SOMEWHERE IN
THE VICINITY OF 5,000.

1167
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:00,690
Man: THAT'S
A LOT OF CAMERAS.

1168
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:03,690
REMEMBER, WE STARTED
WITH JUST ONE.

1169
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,480
HE WAS CURIOUS
FROM BIRTH.

1170
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:09,400
PREMATURE BY 2 WEEKS.

1171
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:11,360
ALMOST AS IF HE COULDN'T
WAIT TO GET STARTED.

1172
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:14,530
Mike: HIS EAGERNESS
TO LEAVE HIS MOTHER'S WOMB

1173
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:16,280
WAS THE VERY REASON
HE WAS THE ONE SELECTED.

1174
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:19,040
IN COMPETITION WITH 5 OTHER
UNWANTED PREGNANCIES,

1175
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:22,250
THE CASTING OF A SHOW,
DETERMINED BY AN AIR DATE,

1176
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:25,170
TRUMAN WAS THE ONE
WHO ARRIVED ON CUE.

1177
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:32,510
Mike: INCIDENTALLY, I BELIEVE
TRUMAN IS THE FIRST CHILD

1178
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:34,720
TO HAVE BEEN LEGALLY ADOPTED
BY A CORPORATION.

1179
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:35,970
THAT'S CORRECT.

1180
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,180
THE SHOW HAS GENERATED
ENORMOUS REVENUES NOW,

1181
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:41,640
EQUIVALENT TO THE GROSS NATIONAL
PRODUCT OF A SMALL COUNTRY.

1182
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:43,770
PEOPLE FORGET IT TAKES
THE POPULATION

1183
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,440
OF AN ENTIRE COUNTRY TO
KEEP THE SHOW RUNNING.

1184
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,360
SINCE THE SHOW IS ON
24-HOURS A DAY

1185
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:50,820
WITHOUT COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTION,
ALL THOSE STAGGERING REVENUES

1186
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:53,410
ARE GENERATED
BY PRODUCT PLACEMENT.

1187
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,990
THAT'S TRUE. EVERYTHING
ON THE SHOW IS FOR SALE.

1188
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,580
FROM THE ACTOR'S WARDROBE,
FOOD PRODUCTS,

1189
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:58,620
TO THE VERY HOMES
THEY LIVE IN.

1190
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:01,960
Mike: AND ALL OF IT AVAILABLE
IN THE TRUMAN CATALOG.

1191
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,420
OPERATORS ARE STANDING BY.

1192
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,250
CHRISTOF, LET ME ASK YOU,

1193
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:08,420
WHY DO YOU THINK TRUMAN
HAS NEVER COME CLOSE

1194
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,880
TO DISCOVERING THE TRUE NATURE
OF HIS WORLD UNTIL NOW?

1195
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:14,050
WE ACCEPT THE REALITY
OF THE WORLD

1196
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,180
WITH WHICH WE ARE
PRESENTED.

1197
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:18,470
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

1198
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,390
THE HAGUE FOR CHRISTOF.

1199
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,060
HELLO? THE HAGUE?

1200
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,190
ALL RIGHT,
WE'VE LOST THAT CALL.

1201
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,360
  LET'S GO TO HOLLYWOOD.
YOU'RE ON  TRU-TALK.

1202
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:30,190
HI, CHRISTOF. I'D JUST
LIKE TO SAY ONE THING.

1203
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,610
YOU'RE A LIAR
AND A MANIPULATOR,

1204
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,700
AND WHAT YOU'VE DONE
TO TRUMAN IS SICK!

1205
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,820
WELL, WE REMEMBER
THIS VOICE, DON'T WE?

1206
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,240
HOW COULD WE FORGET?

1207
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:41,750
Mike: LET'S GO
TO ANOTHER CALL.

1208
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:44,620
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S FINE, MIKE.

1209
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:48,210
I LOVE TO REMINISCE WITH
FORMER MEMBERS OF THE CAST.

1210
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,460
SYLVIA...

1211
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:54,720
AS YOU ANNOUNCED SO
MELODRAMATICALLY TO THE WORLD,

1212
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:58,220
YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU BATTED
YOUR EYES AT TRUMAN ONCE...

1213
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:02,430
FLIRTED WITH HIM...

1214
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,980
STOLE A FEW MINUTES
OF AIR TIME WITH HIM...

1215
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:07,400
TO THRUST YOURSELF AND YOUR
POLITICS INTO THE LIMELIGHT...

1216
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:09,440
THAT YOU KNOW HIM?

1217
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:11,440
THAT YOU KNOW
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR HIM?

1218
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:14,740
YOU REALLY THINK YOU'RE
IN A POSITION TO JUDGE HIM?

1219
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,820
WHAT RIGHT DO YOU HAVE
TO TAKE A BABY

1220
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:19,990
AND TURN HIS LIFE INTO
SOME KIND OF MOCKERY?

1221
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,700
DON'T YOU EVER
FEEL GUILTY?

1222
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:26,670
I HAVE GIVEN TRUMAN A CHANCE
TO LEAD A NORMAL LIFE.

1223
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,420
THE WORLD...

1224
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,590
THE PLACE YOU LIVE IN...

1225
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,260
IS THE SICK PLACE.

1226
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,800
SEAHAVEN'S THE WAY
THE WORLD SHOULD BE.

1227
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:40,550
HE'S NOT A PERFORMER.
HE'S A PRISONER.

1228
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,060
LOOK AT HIM! LOOK AT
WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO HIM!

1229
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,270
HE CAN LEAVE AT ANY TIME.

1230
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:46,940
IF HIS WAS MORE
THAN JUST A VAGUE AMBITION,

1231
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:50,270
IF HE WAS ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED
TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH,

1232
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,570
THERE'S NO WAY
WE COULD PREVENT HIM.

1233
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,740
I THINK WHAT DISTRESSES
YOU REALLY, CALLER,

1234
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,660
IS THAT ULTIMATELY...

1235
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:05,790
TRUMAN PREFERS HIS CELL,

01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:17,490

01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,950
[OVER SPEAKER]
I CAN HEAR YOU.

1585
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:25,580
WHO ARE YOU?

1586
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,790
I AM THE CREATOR
OF A TELEVISION SHOW

1587
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,170
THAT GIVES HOPE AND JOY
AND INSPIRATION TO MILLIONS.

1588
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:38,050
THEN WHO AM I?

1589
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:40,680
YOU'RE THE STAR.

1590
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:47,640
WAS NOTHING REAL?

1591
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:48,650
YOU WERE REAL.

1592
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:51,690
THAT'S WHAT MADE YOU
SO GOOD TO WATCH.

1593
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:54,730
LISTEN TO ME, TRUMAN.

1594
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:57,320
THERE'S NO MORE TRUTH
OUT THERE...

1595
01:32:57,530 --> 01:33:00,530
THAN THERE IS IN THE WORLD
I CREATED FOR YOU.

1596
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,500
THE SAME LIES.

1597
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:08,170
THE SAME DECEIT.

1598
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:10,830
BUT IN MY WORLD...

1599
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:14,710
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO FEAR.

1600
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:19,090
I KNOW YOU BETTER
THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF.

1601
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:22,100
YOU NEVER HAD
A CAMERA IN MY HEAD.

1602
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:25,390
YOU'RE AFRAID.

1603
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,270
THAT'S WHY
YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

1604
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:34,270
IT'S OK, TRUMAN.

1605
01:33:35,650 --> 01:33:37,440
I UNDERSTAND.

1606
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:40,570
I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

1607
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:45,740
I WAS WATCHING
WHEN YOU WERE BORN.

1608
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:50,370
I WAS WATCHING WHEN YOU
TOOK YOUR FIRST STEP.

1609
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:57,510
I WATCHED YOU ON YOUR
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

THE EPISODE WHEN YOU
LOST YOUR FIRST TOOTH.

1612
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:09,810
YOU CAN'T LEAVE, TRUMAN.

1613
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:11,730
PLEASE, GOD.

1614
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:13,940
Christof:
YOU BELONG HERE...

1615
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:16,530
YOU CAN DO IT.

1616
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:19,530

1617
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:22,530
TALK TO ME.

1618
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:25,120
SAY SOMETHING.

1619

WELL, SAY SOMETHING,
GODDAMN IT.

YOU WANT ANOTHER SLICE?

01:35:57,670 --> 01:35:58,540
NO. I'M OK.

1635
