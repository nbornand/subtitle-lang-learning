3
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:17,249
They're going!

4
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,540
Wait for me, shit!

5
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:22,957
Hurry up!

6
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,749
You're not fast enough!

7
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:25,915
Hurry!

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,624
- They bet 1200.
- On what?

9
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,707
First one to dive in the lake.

10
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:34,999
Go!

11
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,207
The water's ice cold.

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,332
Wait for me!

13
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:49,082
- Jump!
- No, I don't wanna!

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,124
It's freezing.

15
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:05,082
November

16
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,374
Shit, I got a cramp!

17
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:20,707
Damn!

18
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:21,999
I'm coming!

19
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,040
Looks like a beached whale.

20
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,082
Give him heart massage.

21
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,832
Don't fuck around!

22
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,790
Did you check the eel traps?

23
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,165
I want 600. I was second.

24
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,999
There's grog in the car.

25
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:12,791
THE HUNT

26
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,874
There's something fishy here.

27
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,540
It's you, Pelle!

28
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,207
Are you alone?

29
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,457
Get him!

30
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,915
I'm done for!

31
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,415
Careful!

32
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,290
Pelle is my new weapon.

33
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,957
Hang up your clothes.

34
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:34,624
I need to go!

35
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,207
- Pee or poo?
- Poo.

36
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,707
Okay, Lucas will help you.

37
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,124
Lucas, would you?

38
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,082
Take off his clothes.

39
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,540
Does it help to jump like that?

40
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,415
- I'm done.
- Good.

41
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,165
Can you manage alone?

42
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,874
Wipe me!

43
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,874
Watch your tone.

44
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,499
Get down.

45
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,457
Soap up.

46
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,582
Come!

47
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,415
Hi, Klara.

48
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,832
Anything wrong?

49
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,415
I'm lost.

50
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,915
Really? Where are Mom and Dad?

51
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,999
Home.

52
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,499
I forgot to look where I was going

53
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,290
and I found myself here.

54
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,624
You were busy avoiding 
the lines in the sidewalk...

55
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,415
and now, you don't know where to go?

56
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,707
No, and I don't remember the way.

57
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,624
That's annoying.

58
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,624
I know the way.

59
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,374
Shall I walk you home?

60
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,832
I'll watch the road,
you watch out for the lines.

61
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,790
Alright.

62
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,374
- Is Fanny coming too?
- Yes, of course.

63
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,540
This way, she'll protect us.

64
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,999
What is your favorite food?

65
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,332
Without a doubt, wild game.

66
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,832
Me, it's fish sticks.

67
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,915
Why are you working
at the kindergarten?

68
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,999
I used to teach at 
your brother's school,

69
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,082
but it closed.

70
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,624
My dad says you're sad because
you live alone in a big house.

71
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,790
He said that?

72
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,165
"Keep your head up

73
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,249
"And your feet on the ground.

74
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,790
"If you sulk, you'll get 
a kick in the ass."

75
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,665
Your father said that?

76
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,499
Mm-hm, "A kick in the ass."

77
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,332
Can I come and take 
Fanny for a walk?

78
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,624
Whenever you want.

79
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,915
Try calling her.

80
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,249
Fanny!

81
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,082
Louder.

82
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,124
Heel!

83
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,457
- Klara, where were you?
- At the supermarket.

84
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,290
I found her there.

85
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,624
Sweetie,

86
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,249
I told you not to run off.

87
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,457
Sorry.

88
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,790
- Coffee?
- Gladly.

89
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,457
Come in.

90
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,540
Go to your room.

91
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,290
Look what the cat dragged in.

92
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,457
Lucas!

93
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,665
Hello, Agnes.

94
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,624
You're a good dog!

95
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,457
Hi, honey.

96
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,082
You didn't put it away,

97
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,790
like you promised.

98
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,040
You leave your carabine
hanging about, too?

99
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,540
My carabine?

100
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,915
This is not a carabine.
It's a rifle.

101
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,207
Torsten!

102
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,499
Girl, you need to think.

103
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,707
We're going to buy soccer shoes.

104
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,874
Don't touch the pie.

105
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,707
Keep your paws off!

106
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,332
I want to find it in one piece.

107
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,582
Torsten, you coming?

108
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,582
Come by one of these days.

109
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,790
We'll make lasagna.

110
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,499
Lasagna!

111
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,874
She'll complain.

112
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,374
Damn, it's hot!

113
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,707
It's good, I got it.

114
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,415
What's the latest about 
your troubles with your ex?

115
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,207
It's alright.

116
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,957
I know when you're lying.

117
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,624
You blink.

118
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,082
Really?

119
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,707
Don't lie to me.

120
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,749
She lets me see him
every second weekend.

121
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,957
Call Kirsten...

122
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,457
Forget the lawyers.

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,040
Silence, Fanny!

124
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,749
Don't talk about Kirsten.

125
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,332
Stop, Fanny!

126
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,624
You miss Marcus?

127
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,915
Obviously I miss my son.

128
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,665
- Phone Kirsten.
- Stop it!

129
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,249
Down!

130
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,915
- Down, you nasty mutt!
- Stop it!

131
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,374
Lie down!

132
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,957
Naughty!

133
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,457
He isn't happy to spend
12 days with you

134
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,165
and two days with me.

135
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,290
I think it works well.

136
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,249
Can I say something?

137
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,915
Thank you.

138
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,332
He wants to spend more time here.

139
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,790
I found a job and 
he said you agreed.

140
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,249
Isn't it true?

141
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,957
Of course he'd say that, Lucas.

142
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,707
He feels sorry for you.

143
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,999
What? Feels sorry for me?!

144
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,624
Of course!

145
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,665
Behave like an adult.

146
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,374
Don't just think about yourself.

147
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,374
Exactly!

148
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,957
It was he who asked.

149
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,415
You're not even able to
respect our agreement.

150
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,165
You're not supposed to call me.

151
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:22,207
How can we discuss this
if you don't call me

152
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,624
and I'm not allowed 
to call you?

153
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,582
When can we talk then?

154
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,832
I'm hanging up.

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,040
No. When can we talk?
Kirsten?

156
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,915
Old cock, big cock,

157
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,874
bent cock, gnarly cock!

158
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,832
Cocks, cocks!

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,249
Hi, Klara.

160
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,374
Look stiff as a club!

161
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,207
Let's go to my room.

162
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,832
Damn, what a huge cock!

163
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,874
Hello, Klara.

164
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,290
Good afternoon.

165
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,207
Listen, you have to take her.

166
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,374
You don't respect 
any agreement!

167
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,957
What agreement?

168
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,124
Are they arguing?

169
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,457
Are you sad?

170
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,374
No, he needs a kick 
in the ass.

171
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,290
When you have kids,

172
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,374
you take them to kindergarten.

173
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,082
Want me to walk you to kindergarten?

174
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,249
Good idea.

175
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,290
I'll tell your father.

176
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,374
Hi. What's all the noise?

177
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,207
It's Agnes. We can't find Klara.

178
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,332
She's here.

179
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,124
Shall I take her?

180
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,040
Gladly. Bye.

181
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,165
It's alright.

182
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,582
Let's go.

183
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:16,457
You, look where we're going
and I'll watch out for the cracks.

184
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,082
Let's do that.

185
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,124
You softies!

186
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,124
Who wants to fly?

187
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,082
Me too!

188
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,624
Alright, come on.

189
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:18,790
Let's take a break!

190
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,332
I can't take any more.

191
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,999
- To me!
- Me too!

192
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,332
He's dying.

193
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,499
Wake up!

194
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,207
Come on, wake up!

195
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,165
Who can raise the dead?

196
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,790
This is the hand of death.

197
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,332
It's time for fruit snacks.

198
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,082
- Fruit!
- Coming.

199
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,040
Put away the stuff first.

200
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,207
Klara?

201
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,457
Come see me.

202
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,374
I found a little gift
in my pocket.

203
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,957
Give it to a friend.

204
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,582
It's not from me.

205
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,582
It says "Klara".

206
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,790
Someone must have
played a trick.

207
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,082
How about you give it
to your mom

208
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,457
or to whoever made it?

209
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,707
And kisses on the mouth,
that's only for mom and dad.

210
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,124
It's not from me.

211
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,832
You lie.

212
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,832
It's not from me.

213
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,624
Boys, put it away
and wash your hands.

214
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,665
- For real?
- Yes.

215
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,832
Hi, Pelle and Janus.

216
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,207
Hey, sweetie! 
You still here?

217
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,082
Your mom won't be long.

218
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,124
Can't wait for Christmas?

219
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,874
Do you remember the song?

220
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,790
How about we sing it?

221
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,040
I hate Lucas.

222
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,457
I thought you were friends.

223
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,332
No way.

224
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,499
Why?

225
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,165
He's stupid.

226
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,665
And ugly.

227
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,249
And he has a weenie.

228
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,874
Like most men.

229
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,040
Like your dad and Torsten.

230
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,249
Yes

231
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:14,290
but his is stiff...

232
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,457
as a club.

233
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,582
What?

234
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,040
It's true.

235
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,915
What happened?

236
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,290
He gave me this heart

237
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,249
but I don't want it.

238
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,124
If that's how you feel,

239
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,290
just throw it away.

240
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,874
Will Santa come?

241
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,207
Y-yes...

242
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,374
- Who knows...
- I think so.

243
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,332
If you've been good, he will.

244
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,915
Hi, Grethe.

245
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,582
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, sweetie!

246
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,249
Why are you in the dark?

247
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,624
I'm really sorry.

248
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,749
I came as soon as possible.

249
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,457
Was everything fine?

250
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,915
Is there a problem?

251
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,040
No, we collected

252
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,874
mushrooms and animal poop
in the woods.

253
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,999
Sounds great!

254
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,540
Come, let's go.

255
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,665
See you soon, Klara.

256
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,207
Goodbye, Grethe.

257
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,957
Come on, sweetie.

258
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,249
We'll go home quick
and take care of dinner.

259
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,332
OK?

260
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,790
I'm delighted to hear it.

261
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,415
Something happened?

262
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,790
Goodbye.

263
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:02,915
See you soon!

264
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,749
Did you talk about it?

265
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,707
Yes. He wants to live with you.

266
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,707
He's very angry.

267
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,790
Everything will be fine.

268
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,874
I'll bring him to you
whenever he likes.

269
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,082
Okay?

270
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,874
You should talk to him.

271
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,540
I'll get him for you.

272
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,707
Sorry, I'm just passing through.

273
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:31,874
Dad?

274
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,957
Okay, Marcus?

275
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,374
Yes, but I can't change schools.

276
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,582
We'll manage.

277
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,374
I must go see mom.

278
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,207
You're right.

279
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,790
Marcus

280
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,124
Be nice to her.
She's in pain.

281
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,540
'Course. Bye.

282
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,374
I love you. See you soon.

283
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,290
Sorry. Hi.

284
00:17:58,916 --> 00:17:59,665
Hi.

285
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,124
It was my son.

286
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,749
He's coming to live with me.

287
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:08,999
OK! Great

288
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:13,399
So maybe we should have 
a cup of coffee to celebrate?

289
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,540
- "Kaffe".
- Kaffe.

290
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,040
Coffee now? Here?

291
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,874
Alright coffee.

292
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,207
With milk?

293
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,499
No, I take it black and strong.

294
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,249
But I make the coffee.

295
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,457
Yes, I make the coffee,
and you do the dishes.

296
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,665
I do no more dishes today.

297
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,957
So, that's it. Okay?

298
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,499
Like this?

299
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,540
Better to do it this way.

300
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:10,832
Like that.

301
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:13,957
You're very good at this.

302
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,374
Thank you.

303
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,707
Can you straighten up
the courtyard?

304
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,499
'Course.

305
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,082
Hey, very good!

306
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,374
So far I haven't found any job
that matches my education.

307
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,082
But, hey, I like it here.

308
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,707
I like all the fresh air, I like 
the kids, I like all the nice people,

309
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,290
all the good-looking men.

310
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,832
Well, see you to-Moh.. Moh.
(Vi ses i morgen.)

311
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,040
Monday.
(Mandag)

312
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,374
See you tomorrow.

313
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,499
No, Monday. This is the weekend.

314
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,707
I enjoy seeing each other.

315
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,082
So do I.

316
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,374
Come here.

317
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,124
"Du er sød."

318
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,374
You're cute.

319
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,207
You too.

320
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,332
Just put it there.

321
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,457
You bagged nothing at all!

322
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:58,040
This is the first time
I came back empty-handed.

323
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,249
I assure you.

324
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:07,499
Your eyesight might be
deteriorating. Try these.

325
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,957
Listen everybody.
I'm going to call Ulla.

326
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,374
You bring the roast pork.

327
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:27,499
Eel.

328
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:28,665
Pudding.

329
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:32,832
- Johan, pork with apples.
- Let's toast

330
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,415
You take care of
the pork with apples.

331
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,832
This is Lucas.

332
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,457
Hello?

333
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,790
I can't hear a thing.
Just a moment.

334
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,040
Hello? Lucas, here.

335
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,624
Why do you never call me?

336
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,540
Sorry, what?

337
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,040
Why do you never call me?

338
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,207
Because I don't
have your number.

339
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,749
Look on your phone.
It is on the display, right?

340
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:13,915
Yes it is.

341
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,207
So, call me.

342
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,707
Hello, it's Nadja.

343
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:29,915
It's me.

344
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,124
Who?

345
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,499
It's me.

346
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,999
What are you doing?

347
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:39,957
Nothing.

348
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:44,957
And you?

349
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,582
I'm at a meeting.

350
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,665
<i>(Some pussy!)

351
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,082
- No, not really.
- A meeting?

352
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,207
I'm really happy you called.

353
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,415
I think a lot about you.

354
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,957
So, should we meet?

355
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,290
Yeah, I'd like that.

356
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,832
Who did you call? A girl?

357
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,290
Stop, Bent.

358
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:28,707
I'm just trying to tell you
all he just called a woman.

359
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:38,790
Can Lucas, can Lucas,
can Lucas, drink a beert?!

360
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:55,999
Of course, but of course
But of course he can drank!

361
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,374
- I have a gift for you.
- And it's not even Christmas yet.

362
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,915
Come on, I'll help you.

363
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:14,915
- Did he drink a lot?
- Too many for me to count.

364
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,665
Thank you very much.

365
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,249
Lucas...

366
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,290
You're my best friend.

367
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,790
My best friend.

368
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:29,999
- See you next...
- Kisses.

369
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,999
Can you handle him?

370
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:33,540
Thanks for your help.

371
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,499
I'll call you in case of problems.

372
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:42,582
Agnes...

373
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,290
I have to speak to you.

374
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:52,207
You know why you're so pretty?

375
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,332
No.

376
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,540
Because you don't know it.

377
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:05,374
- My love...
- I love you.

378
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:14,457
I love you.

379
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,999
I love you very much.

380
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,665
- Did you wait long?
- Yes.

381
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:27,915
Sorry.

382
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,207
This is my dog, Fanny.

383
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,290
This is my kitchen.

384
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,749
- You want some coffee? Or...
- No.

385
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,999
Fanny!

386
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,374
Where are you?

387
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,165
Come!

388
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,582
Thanks for the ball.

389
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:03,832
She learned that when
she was one year old.

390
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,124
Fanny! She wants 
to see it again.

391
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,082
She wants to see it again.

392
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,624
Where does the dog sleep?

393
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:18,499
Downstairs.

394
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:19,999
- Good Idea?
- Yeah.

395
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:22,332
- I throw the ball.
- Throw it.

396
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,790
Good.

397
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,665
- Can you see?
- I see you.

398
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,415
You won't strangle me, eh?

399
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,374
Socks or no socks?

400
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:05,499
Socks.

401
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,499
I scared you for once!

402
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:53,540
Lucas!

403
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,415
Hi!

404
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:58,957
- I'll get you!
- Can you come here?

405
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:01,457
Yeah, coming.

406
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:04,165
I can't catch you, kids.

407
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:08,124
I'll drink some magic potion
and I'll come back.

408
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,374
Hello, Grethe.

409
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,249
Hello, Lucas. Sit.

410
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,457
How's little Marcus?

411
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:21,207
Fine. Not so little anymore.

412
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,165
He wants to move in with me
before Christmas.

413
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,707
Try as I might...

414
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,082
but I can't stop
thinking about this:

415
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:39,249
A child told me something.

416
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,707
I must speak to you about it.

417
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,790
Sure.

418
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:47,665
This child has a vivid imagination,

419
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,707
but we should discuss it.

420
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:50,915
Sure.

421
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:52,874
Who it is?

422
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,165
I can't say.

423
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:05,499
According to this child,
some things happened.

424
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:08,040
Adult things.

425
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:14,749
What things? What happened?

426
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,374
This child, girl or boy, claims...

427
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,665
it doesn't like you.

428
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:27,665
And he or she saw 
your private parts.

429
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,874
How is such a thing possible?

430
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,374
I don't know.

431
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:51,790
Damn!

432
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:56,999
This is serious,

433
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,624
but don't worry.

434
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,707
I draw no conclusion.

435
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,332
We'll see.

436
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:08,457
What was said, exactly?

437
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:10,790
I can't answer that.

438
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:15,249
It's time for fruit snacks,
let's go.

439
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:25,290
Take a few days off,
until we find out more.

440
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:27,457
Finish your day.

441
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,749
We'll find a solution.

442
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,374
Alright.

443
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:10,582
Did I make you wait?

444
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,999
No, it's okay.

445
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,999
I don't know how 
to go about this.

446
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:20,332
Let's start now.

447
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:25,082
Klara...

448
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:30,332
can you tell me exactly

449
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,707
what you said to Grethe?

450
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:51,832
Please, tell him 
what you told me

451
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:53,499
about the heart-shaped cookie.

452
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,915
I said nothing.

453
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:06,415
So, it's just...

454
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:10,499
Grethe who made it all up?

455
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,415
- Or did you make it up?
- No.

456
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:18,749
Good.

457
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,124
So try telling me.

458
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:31,999
You can tell.

459
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:40,457
Is it true what you said?

460
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:42,207
That you saw...

461
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:44,707
Lucas' weenie?

462
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:01,540
Can you tell me what Lucas did.

463
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,082
You can try, Klara.

464
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:09,957
I wanna go play.

465
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:13,082
But you need to answer.

466
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:15,374
Don't be afraid.

467
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:16,832
Ole is nice.

468
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:20,457
He just wants to know
what happened.

469
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:27,124
Did he show you 
his weenie, here?

470
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:31,749
Is that it?

471
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:54,760
You nod your head.

472
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:59,124
It was here, in kindergarten?

473
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:07,374
Tell me what happened.

474
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:14,124
Grethe said you explained
his weenie was all hard.

475
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:18,624
His weenie was quite hard?

476
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:22,915
I think so. I don't remember.

477
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:26,124
But he showed you his weenie?

478
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:37,124
Does it upset you
to talk about Lucas?

479
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:51,165
Because you don't like
what he did?

480
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:58,832
You're doing very well

481
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,707
at answering my questions.

482
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,540
We're almost done.

483
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,249
What did he do...

484
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:12,624
after showning you his willy?

485
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:14,874
I don't know.

486
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,540
Did you touch it?

487
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,624
Do you remember?

488
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:34,082
Did some white stuff come out?

489
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:45,707
Maybe too much all at once.

490
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,082
You can go play.

491
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,124
You think?...

492
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:54,040
Yeah, just keep an eye on her.

493
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:04,790
You and me, we know.

494
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,624
That's a good thing.

495
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,790
But this case,

496
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:11,915
concerns the police.

497
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:16,040
And we need
the parents' consent.

498
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:18,082
Thanks for your help.

499
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,249
I don't know how 
to handle it.

500
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:24,165
Klara has a wild imagination.

501
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:28,082
But I believe her.

502
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,915
Anyway, she doesn't seem
to have made it all up.

503
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,499
No.

504
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:47,790
Ole thinks we must 
report this matter.

505
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,832
We must notify
the authorities.

506
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,082
Is the parents' 
meeting canceled?

507
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,749
I don't think so.

508
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,290
We are obliged to
inform other parents.

509
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:07,040
Where's Klara?

510
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,415
She's playing outside.

511
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,124
Where's Lucas?

512
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:18,207
He's also playing outside.

513
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,082
What if he went home?

514
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:21,665
Yes, that's better.

515
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,332
- Hi, Grethe.
- Hi.

516
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,707
- Torsten.
- Grethe.

517
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,165
We were leaving for
soccer when you called.

518
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,665
Sit.

519
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,540
I thought it was at 7:PM.

520
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:04,749
Everything okay?

521
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:07,207
We need to talk about Klara.

522
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,749
It's better if Torsten waited outside.

523
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:17,749
Torsten wake up.
Go text somebody, or play.

524
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,249
I won't be long.

525
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,165
What did that 
rascal do, now?

526
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:33,082
Something happened that's forbidden
between children and adults.

527
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,082
I'm sincerely sorry.

528
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:38,540
I couldn't prevent it.

529
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:40,915
Klara gave

530
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:43,832
sexual details 
about an adult.

531
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,999
I don't think children lie
about these things.

532
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,457
I don't understand.

533
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,290
What are you trying to say?

534
00:39:57,916 --> 00:39:58,957
It seems...

535
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:02,999
Klara was a victim
of sexual abuse, here.

536
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:06,665
Probably by a 
close family friend.

537
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,499
Sexual abuse?

538
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:13,124
What she said...

539
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,790
She'll surely deny it all
because she is ashamed.

540
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:20,707
But...

541
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:25,749
How?

542
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,374
We'll check to see how 
serious the situation is.

543
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,165
Hello! Here's the cake.

544
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,790
- No lactose?
- Yeah.

545
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,749
Your attention, please.

546
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,957
There's a new item
on the agenda.

547
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:19,874
There is suspicion of
indecent behaviour...

548
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:24,457
towards children.

549
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:30,249
It may be assumed that

550
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:33,624
an adult has abused a child.

551
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,749
There may be several victims.

552
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,582
Watch for

553
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:48,665
any consequent symptoms.

554
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:53,249
Bedwetting, headaches, nightmares.

555
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:55,499
We will go into details.

556
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:57,332
Please read this brochure.

557
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:03,499
This is a serious accusation!

558
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:07,124
No need to panic.

559
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:11,707
We will follow procedure
to the letter, of course.

560
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,415
Hello, Marcus.

561
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:29,040
Hello?

562
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:34,499
Dad?

563
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:36,457
Why are you whispering?

564
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,290
I'm not allowed to call you.

565
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:46,374
Who forbids you?

566
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:49,165
Did something happen?

567
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:55,082
Are you crying?

568
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,915
They say stuff about you.

569
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:03,124
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

570
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:04,415
Or live with you.

571
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,540
Who said that? Your mother?

572
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:13,124
They say disgusting stuff
happened at the kindergarten.

573
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,965
Don't listen to them.
It's not true.

574
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,332
Who called?

575
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:27,082
Grethe from the kindergarten.

576
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:34,082
Go to school as usual.

577
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,249
We'll talk tonight.

578
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:41,207
Don't worry.

579
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:42,374
Okay, m'dear?

580
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:50,624
I should have told you,
I'm sorry.

581
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:51,874
Yesterday...

582
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:58,332
I was told that a child said

583
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,207
I had shown him my weiner...

584
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:02,415
or "her".

585
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:10,332
I'm sorry, but...

586
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:12,915
that is...

587
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:15,624
really far out!

588
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:23,415
Marcus's mother was informed.

589
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:26,374
By whom?

590
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:32,082
Hi, Lucas!

591
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:38,957
Hi.

592
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:44,249
Not now, guys.

593
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,707
Is Grethe in?

594
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:50,749
I thought you were on leave.

595
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:52,290
I just need to...

596
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:59,499
What are you all doing here?

597
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:03,499
I need to speak to you.

598
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:07,082
I'm busy.

599
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:16,749
Go home.
Leave Grethe alone.

600
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,040
Grethe!

601
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:25,749
Come back!

602
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:29,040
Stop!

603
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,957
Where are you going?

604
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:33,457
This is absurd.

605
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:35,832
I asked you not to come!

606
00:45:37,416 --> 00:45:39,040
I'm not hurting anyone.

607
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:40,999
Stop where you are.

608
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,457
How could you?
You disgust me!

609
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:45,499
What have I done?

610
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:48,499
It feels wrong 
just to be around you.

611
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:51,374
Let me tell you what's wrong.

612
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,290
You called Marcus' mother

613
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:57,249
and now he's not allowed
to come see me.

614
00:45:58,416 --> 00:46:00,374
What do you think he's thinking?

615
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:04,790
I think kids don't lie.

616
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:08,332
Leave Marcus alone. Got it?

617
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:11,582
Leave my family out of it.
Got it?

618
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,582
You, leave my kids alone.

619
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:14,874
You are sick!

620
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:17,040
Klara is an innocent little girl.

621
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:19,499
It's Klara?

622
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:24,082
- Come on.
- I'm talking, Johan.

623
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,707
- Let's go.
- What did she say?

624
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:31,082
She's the daughter
of my best friend.

625
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:32,582
Come on.

626
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:37,540
Shit, it's Klara!

627
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:39,332
I need to talk to Theo.

628
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:40,999
Come on.

629
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:44,332
What are you doing here?

630
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:47,415
Why is Ulla crying?

631
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:48,749
You can't stay there.

632
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:50,582
What the fuck?

633
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:51,874
What is it?

634
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,915
We have nothing to say. Go!

635
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,374
Have you lost your head?

636
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:58,207
Maybe. Move it.

637
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,790
What are you looking at?

638
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:04,040
Go, Lucas.

639
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:37,707
Hi, Theo.

640
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:40,915
We need to talk.

641
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,874
The others are asleep.

642
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,915
I'll get something to drink.

643
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:22,749
I made lemonade.

644
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,124
If you're thirsty...

645
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:31,082
Thanks.

646
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,082
Listen,

647
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:35,957
we need to talk.

648
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:46,165
What are they saying?

649
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,082
You need to ask
your daughter.

650
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,332
They won't tell me anything.

651
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:56,957
It's gotten way out of hand.

652
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:04,207
You and me have to bring
things out in the open.

653
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:06,165
We need to see Grethe

654
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,957
before it degenerates all the way.

655
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:21,082
You want me to ask Klara?

656
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:24,915
- Is this what you want?
- That you ask Klara?

657
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:27,082
Of course. Why?

658
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:30,957
I know her.

659
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:33,915
She doesn't lie. 
She's never lied.

660
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:40,124
Why would she lie?

661
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:46,165
I don't know.

662
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:49,640
But she's lying about this.

663
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:02,249
Damn, Lucas...

664
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,290
I haven't touched your daughter.

665
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:15,499
You know that.

666
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:20,124
Do you believe me...

667
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,207
or not?

668
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:26,624
I don't know.

669
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,957
Theo, I haven't touched your daughter.

670
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:37,124
I don't know.

671
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:50,624
What's he doing here?

672
00:50:50,791 --> 00:50:52,832
He isn't supposed to be here.

673
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,915
I suppose not.

674
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,874
- Lucas, go away.
- What have I done?

675
00:50:58,083 --> 00:50:59,207
Get out!

676
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:01,874
What do you think I did?

677
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:06,207
Shut up and go!
I don't wanna talk to you!

678
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:07,415
Disappear!

679
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:10,790
I forbid you to sit
on our couch, bastard!

680
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:12,915
I never want to see you again!

681
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:14,749
I'll cut your prick off!

682
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:22,332
Are you crazy?

683
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,781
If you have, touched my daughter,

684
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,040
I'll put a bullet in the head.

685
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:30,582
And I believe you did it,
because she says so.

686
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,540
You wanna fuck up my life,
is that it?

687
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:37,999
Look at me!

688
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:39,499
What are you doing?

689
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:42,290
Hi, Klara.

690
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:43,957
Hi, Lucas.

691
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:47,165
Go to your room.

692
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:48,582
Agnes!

693
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:53,540
Come into the living room.

694
00:51:57,291 --> 00:51:58,749
Dad is sad?

695
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:02,457
It'll pass,

696
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:04,040
you know.

697
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:07,457
We'll stay here until
we're all wide wake.

698
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,374
You angry at Lucas?

699
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,832
Let's cuddle a bit like this.

700
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:18,915
He hasn't done anything.

701
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:21,457
I made up nonsense, that's all.

702
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:24,290
Now all the kids
talk about it.

703
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:26,332
It didn't happen.

704
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:37,082
Klara... Sweetheart.

705
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:41,624
It's hard to understand

706
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:45,207
but it can happen.

707
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:49,665
Your brain would rather
forget what happened.

708
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,124
It's unpleasant 
to think about.

709
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,207
But it happened.

710
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:00,624
And we're very happy
you told us about it.

711
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:03,665
Okay, darling?

712
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:10,332
Come!

713
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:13,082
Let's eat some cake.

714
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:25,374
Hello, Nadja.
Come in, sit.

715
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:38,040
Surely you're aware...

716
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:41,749
we reported the incident to the police.

717
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:45,957
Should I speak English?

718
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:47,415
No, it's okay.

719
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:51,040
Knowing the symptoms
of sexual abuse,

720
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:52,749
parents have asked their children

721
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:55,915
if they had nightmares.

722
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,124
You know?

723
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:02,332
Several parents

724
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:04,832
reported symptoms of abuse.

725
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,040
So we took action.

726
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:09,457
Why am I here?

727
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:17,915
Are you seeing Lucas?

728
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:19,457
Is Lucas your boyfriend?

729
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:26,540
- Yeah.
- I'll try to say it in English.

730
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:28,665
It is our duty

731
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:33,499
to inform the authorities
about such matters,

732
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:35,624
in a very serious 
case like this.

733
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,374
OK. Why?

734
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,790
I don't think,

735
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,874
that anyone here

736
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:46,582
is any longer in doubt about what Lucas

737
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:47,832
has done.

738
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:51,040
Lucas brought Klara here.

739
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,915
They were seen together.

740
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,082
He is alone with the children.

741
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:59,457
In the toilet or the playroom.

742
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:03,707
Kirsten, it's me again.
Call me.

743
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:15,207
Doesn't answer.

744
00:55:16,041 --> 00:55:17,332
Maybe she needs more time.

745
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,874
I need to talk to Marcus.

746
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:30,415
What are they saying at work?

747
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:45,582
Hi Klara.

748
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,874
Hi.

749
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,665
What are you doing here?

750
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:58,332
Can I take Fanny for a walk?

751
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:02,124
OK, sure.

752
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:06,290
Does mom know where you are?

753
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:15,582
You should tell her before coming.

754
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,499
They say you hurt me.

755
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:40,415
Do you think so, too?

756
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:46,874
I don't know, I don't remember.

757
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,124
What did I do, sweetie?

758
00:56:57,625 --> 00:57:00,415
I don't remember anymore.

759
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:03,165
And also the others.

760
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:09,707
What others?

761
00:57:13,916 --> 00:57:15,374
Who do you mean?

762
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:18,332
I'm scared.

763
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,415
You want to go home?

764
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:33,374
What about Fanny?

765
00:57:35,166 --> 00:57:37,249
You can walk her another time.

766
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:41,415
You'd better go home.

767
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:02,957
Did you touch that girl?

768
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:06,790
What?

769
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:12,332
You're not a sick person, right?

770
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,124
What do you think?

771
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,124
No... Ahm.. I'm just...

772
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:28,957
I'm getting a little...

773
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:30,707
disoriented.

774
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:31,540
How so?

775
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:34,582
Sorry it doesn't matter.

776
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,582
You think I'm crazy?

777
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:48,040
Is that it?

778
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:02,790
Go away. Take your stuff.

779
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:04,249
Stop it.

780
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:08,707
- I want you to go.
- Hey, hey...[Russian?]

781
00:59:14,125 --> 00:59:15,832
Why are you doing this?

782
00:59:16,416 --> 00:59:18,040
I abused a child.

783
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:20,082
That's what you're implying, idiot!

784
00:59:22,666 --> 00:59:24,374
Go!

785
00:59:24,666 --> 00:59:25,582
Clear off!

786
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:36,624
Look, it's snowing.

787
00:59:39,166 --> 00:59:40,874
- Pile it on the elf.
- Yes.

788
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:48,749
Him...

789
00:59:49,416 --> 00:59:52,332
he should be on the lake.

790
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,540
That's right.

791
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:55,832
They're skating.

792
00:59:57,875 --> 00:59:59,499
Where does he go?

793
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:01,374
You choose.

794
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:03,540
There.

795
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:13,624
And he goes on top.

796
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,249
That way, he can see everything.

797
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,207
Shouldn't he join the others?

798
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,124
It's snowing!

799
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:36,624
Don't you wanna see?

800
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:38,707
- I'm coming.
- Come on!

801
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:41,040
How beautiful it is!

802
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,332
Don't catch cold.

803
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:57,628
December

804
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,374
What the...?!

805
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:21,790
Marcus?

806
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,165
Is that you?

807
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:28,415
Sorry. Come.

808
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,790
You scared me.

809
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:32,249
I didn't mean to.

810
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,749
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

811
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:38,124
Hi, Fanny.

812
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:39,707
Old girl!

813
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:44,665
Let's go in.

814
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,749
Your mother know you're here?

815
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:48,040
Yeah.

816
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:50,499
Where's the key?

817
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:53,749
I gave it to someone.
I'll ask for it back.

818
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:54,957
Fanny, come!

819
01:02:55,708 --> 01:02:57,040
Are you hungry?

820
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:01,207
What a mess! It's filthy.

821
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:02,624
Come.

822
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,790
Stop it.

823
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:12,957
Mom suggested
I come to say hello.

824
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,290
Shouldn't you be in class?

825
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:19,790
I took a few days off.

826
01:03:21,291 --> 01:03:25,374
You know the situation
is not normal around here.

827
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:27,457
I was fired.

828
01:03:28,416 --> 01:03:30,082
The police is on the case,

829
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,624
but no one tells me a damn thing.

830
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:36,707
I'm going crazy.

831
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:42,374
Mom know you're here?

832
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,040
Right?

833
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:52,082
Fuck!

834
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:54,707
I'm crying again.

835
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:06,832
You want to talk?

836
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:13,874
It's okay.

837
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:16,540
- I'll be alright.
- Don't worry.

838
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:18,124
- Sorry.
- It's alright.

839
01:04:18,291 --> 01:04:20,207
This is ridiculous.

840
01:04:20,916 --> 01:04:21,999
Come.

841
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,707
Hi.

842
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:38,249
My godson!

843
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:40,790
Hi, Marcus.

844
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:43,749
You were able to come!

845
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:47,499
What an atmosphere in here!

846
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:48,290
Coffee?

847
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:56,999
- Have you talked to the police?
- Yeah.

848
01:04:57,166 --> 01:04:58,582
What did they say?

849
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:05,082
They asked a lot of questions.

850
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:09,465
Apparently, I'm supposed to
have touched other children.

851
01:05:09,708 --> 01:05:11,332
This is madness.

852
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,582
Altogether.

853
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,290
But damn, you did nothing!

854
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:23,332
Now they're all ganged up.
Johan, Bent...

855
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:27,290
They all lost their marbles.

856
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:33,957
You let them walk all over you.
I already told you.

857
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:39,124
Is Fanny okay?

858
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:40,957
Kirsten!

859
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:44,374
Still works.

860
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:50,332
I don't know.

861
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:57,707
Thank you.

862
01:05:58,125 --> 01:06:00,499
It'll be alright. 
Marcus is here.

863
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:04,040
He won't even pour a coffee
for his godfather.

864
01:06:04,416 --> 01:06:05,999
How about your hunting license?

865
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:07,957
- October 16.
- The 16th?

866
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,374
The day when the man becomes a boy
and the boy becomes a man.

867
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:21,082
Tell mom that you're here.

868
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:23,415
Marcus?

869
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:26,790
If she gets angry,
I'll set her her straight.

870
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,332
That'll be 269.50.

871
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,332
- There.
- Thank you.

872
01:06:57,541 --> 01:07:00,040
- And here's 30.50.
- Thank you.

873
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,040
Hi, Marcus!

874
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:06,915
Your father around?

875
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:14,165
Tell him, we don't want
either of you here, anymore.

876
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:19,124
- Why?
- You know how it is...

877
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:21,290
We have other customers.

878
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:23,374
Just don't come.

879
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:46,749
What's going on?

880
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,165
- Is this your son?
- Yes.

881
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,999
Do you mind?

882
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:59,540
Call mom, tell her
to come get you.

883
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,207
I've been arrested.
I have to go.

884
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:03,582
Okay?

885
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:05,749
Get in.

886
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:08,749
Slide over.

887
01:08:23,583 --> 01:08:24,582
Fuck!

888
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:49,790
Do you have a key
to our house?

889
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:58,624
A key? I don't think so.

890
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:01,207
- I'm going.
- Marcus!

891
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:02,874
Okay?

892
01:09:07,416 --> 01:09:10,832
Look, we know they 
nabbed your father.

893
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:19,540
Can I talk to you?

894
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:21,457
What?

895
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,499
Can I talk to you?

896
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:25,707
Yes, but...

897
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,832
Come in. Are you hungry?

898
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:34,957
Say hello to Marcus.

899
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:37,582
Klara, you can get the glasses?

900
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:39,374
Hi, Marcus.

901
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:41,749
Hi.

902
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:49,124
So ... Later!

903
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,540
He's there.

904
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:11,957
Marcus... we can drop you off.

905
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,915
Or, call your mother.

906
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,059
Marcus, you okay?

907
01:10:31,416 --> 01:10:33,207
Will you help my father?

908
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:36,540
Help your father?

909
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:38,790
How so?

910
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:42,457
Will you think about it?

911
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:45,915
Marcus, you're a nice boy

912
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:48,915
and I understand how you feel.

913
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:52,457
You don't have to pay for his mistakes.

914
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:54,499
He hasn't done what he's accused of.

915
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,124
Go to your room, dear.

916
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:01,082
I want to talk to Klara.

917
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,915
- Hi, Klara.
- Hi.

918
01:11:06,416 --> 01:11:07,415
Are you okay?

919
01:11:11,416 --> 01:11:12,582
Why are you lying?

920
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:14,332
I'm not lying.

921
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,499
Come on, Klara.

922
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:18,374
I just want to talk...

923
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:19,374
Enough!

924
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:22,749
Stop it!

925
01:11:22,916 --> 01:11:25,790
- Don't touch her.
- Piss off!

926
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:28,249
Enough!

927
01:11:28,416 --> 01:11:30,457
I just wanna talk to her!

928
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:32,915
Why are you lying, bitch?

929
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,374
It's not true!

930
01:11:36,916 --> 01:11:39,582
- Get him out!
- I wanna talk to her!

931
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:42,499
Enough.

932
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,540
Fuck!

933
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:48,665
Stop, Johan!

934
01:11:49,666 --> 01:11:51,082
Enough!

935
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:52,582
Stop.

936
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:54,915
Get off me!

937
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:56,290
Leave him alone!

938
01:11:58,833 --> 01:12:01,165
- Get up and go home.
- Move it!

939
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:02,624
Go home.

940
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:05,165
Bunch of bastards!

941
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,332
Come.

942
01:12:10,666 --> 01:12:12,249
Bunch of bastards!

943
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:31,374
I'm glad to see you.
Come in and get warm.

944
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:34,665
Damn, you're exhausted.

945
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,832
Did somebody hit you?

946
01:12:43,666 --> 01:12:44,290
No.

947
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:46,290
Holy shit!

948
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,290
Less noise, girls!

949
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:57,499
We've got relatives visiting.

950
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:03,665
My two sisters.

951
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,707
You met them when
you were little.

952
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:08,249
It's been a while!

953
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:09,457
Okay?

954
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:10,707
Fine.

955
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:13,457
Chip and Dale.
Cracking nuts.

956
01:13:13,325 --> 01:13:16,732
My father... He's trying 
to help out yours.

957
01:13:21,166 --> 01:13:23,207
Here's Lucas' son, Marcus.

958
01:13:23,416 --> 01:13:25,124
My brothers-in-law.

959
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:26,332
Elias

960
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:27,832
and Erik.

961
01:13:28,958 --> 01:13:31,332
I'm Erik.
This jerk is Elias.

962
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:34,165
Sit.
Offer him a drink.

963
01:13:34,416 --> 01:13:35,582
You thirsty?

964
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:41,749
Is water, okay?

965
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:43,499
Thank you.

966
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:46,957
Marcus, I spoke to your mother.

967
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:48,790
Don't forget to call home.

968
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:50,457
Okay?

969
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,457
You know what'll happen to Dad?

970
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,082
What did your old man say?

971
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:08,832
He said Lucas will have

972
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:11,290
a preliminary hearing tomorrow.

973
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:13,707
At 8 h 30.

974
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:15,874
There are two options.

975
01:14:16,583 --> 01:14:19,832
Either the judge upholds
"preventive detention",

976
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:25,332
or he finds no reason to 
continue holding him.

977
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:31,832
Which do you think it'll be?

978
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,457
I don't know.

979
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:39,249
But...

980
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:44,082
apparently all the children 
say the same thing.

981
01:14:44,291 --> 01:14:47,582
They describe your basement.

982
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:51,540
Wallpaper, color of the sofa...

983
01:14:52,625 --> 01:14:55,915
But when the police searched
the house this morning...

984
01:14:57,541 --> 01:14:59,374
What did they discover, Marcus?

985
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,207
We have no basement.

986
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:07,790
Exactly.

987
01:15:09,416 --> 01:15:12,582
- What does that mean?
- They have no basement.

988
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,124
What does it mean for Lucas?

989
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:16,040
That there is still hope.

990
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,415
What's the story?

991
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:21,790
Children often invent

992
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:24,624
details that do not exist.

993
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:28,749
I don't know if it's their imagination

994
01:15:28,916 --> 01:15:31,624
or if they repeat what their peers

995
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:33,124
or their parents say.

996
01:15:33,291 --> 01:15:36,957
We always assume
that children don't lie.

997
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:40,915
Unfortunately, they lie often.

998
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:45,165
And now?

999
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:47,457
Now?

1000
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:49,540
We'll see.

1001
01:15:50,541 --> 01:15:52,124
They'll call us tomorrow.

1002
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:06,874
Morning, big guy.

1003
01:17:10,916 --> 01:17:11,999
Sleep well?

1004
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:16,832
I brought bread
cheese and coffee.

1005
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:18,082
Thanks.

1006
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:22,665
I need to talk to you.

1007
01:17:24,416 --> 01:17:26,165
I must tell you,

1008
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:30,624
I'm your godfather
and you can count on me.

1009
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:34,665
Whatever happens. Okay?

1010
01:17:38,958 --> 01:17:40,582
I just spoke to your father.

1011
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:42,999
It looks good.

1012
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:45,165
He's coming by taxi.

1013
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:46,207
What?

1014
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,124
They released him.

1015
01:17:49,041 --> 01:17:51,457
Eat your toast and drink your coffee.

1016
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,124
Afterwards, we'll go downstairs

1017
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:56,707
to welcome to your father.

1018
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:23,040
Hello!

1019
01:18:23,341 --> 01:18:27,140
If you fondle your kid
you'll end up back in jail.

1020
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:29,707
The eggs and bacon 
won't eat themselves.

1021
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:30,707
Come on.

1022
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:33,249
It's nice to see you again,
scoundrel!

1023
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:37,749
Fanny! Hello, my girl!

1024
01:18:38,291 --> 01:18:40,374
It could have been worse.

1025
01:18:40,666 --> 01:18:44,207
You two, take a shovel
and dig a basement.

1026
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:46,499
Fanny peed on the floor.

1027
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:48,957
No, it must have been
the policemen!

1028
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,874
- Fanny!
- She'll come back.

1029
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:35,082
You want me to wash
the pants that I found?

1030
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:39,374
Well?

1031
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,540
What are you getting at?

1032
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:44,332
Nothing.

1033
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:47,040
I just wonder if 
I should wash it.

1034
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:48,707
Yes, if you found it.

1035
01:19:49,541 --> 01:19:51,207
I'll be a minute.

1036
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:53,374
You're gonna wear it dirty.

1037
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:56,249
Is this your girlfriend?

1038
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:59,124
I thought she was,
before all this happened.

1039
01:20:02,416 --> 01:20:05,290
I wanted to introduce you,
but we'll see.

1040
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:10,582
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

1041
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:13,624
It's not my thing.

1042
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:16,665
To have a girlfriend?

1043
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:18,957
No.

1044
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:23,957
And Jasmin?

1045
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:26,624
That was over a year ago!

1046
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,040
Stay there.

1047
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:38,874
Don't move.

1048
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:42,582
What is it?

1049
01:21:46,166 --> 01:21:48,040
- What is it, Dad?
- Go back in.

1050
01:21:51,666 --> 01:21:53,332
Let's go back.

1051
01:21:54,916 --> 01:21:56,832
Come on, Marcus.

1052
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,624
Forget it!

1053
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:25,915
- You're all dead!
- Stop.

1054
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:28,374
- Calm down.
- You will die!

1055
01:22:28,541 --> 01:22:29,957
Come here.

1056
01:22:30,416 --> 01:22:32,499
- Let go of me!
- Stop it.

1057
01:22:32,666 --> 01:22:33,874
I'll kill you!

1058
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:39,624
I'll kill you!

1059
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:41,874
Don't leave her out there.

1060
01:22:56,916 --> 01:22:57,915
Lucas?

1061
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:10,332
I'd like to be alone.

1062
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:13,207
Where's Marcus?

1063
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:18,290
You sent him back 
to his mother?

1064
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:19,499
Yeah.

1065
01:23:23,542 --> 01:23:24,457
Go back home.

1066
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:27,165
Please leave me, Bruun.

1067
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:28,707
Come inside.

1068
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:29,915
I told you to leave!

1069
01:23:30,333 --> 01:23:31,999
Get out! Go home!

1070
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:34,749
Go away.

1071
01:24:17,166 --> 01:24:19,082
There you are.
Merry Christmas.

1072
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:20,457
Merry Christmas, Per.

1073
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:25,082
I'd like two cutlets.

1074
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:27,499
I don't have any.

1075
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:33,040
I meant these pork cutlets.

1076
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:34,540
I won't sell you anything.

1077
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:44,749
I have the right to be here.

1078
01:24:45,541 --> 01:24:46,790
Go away.

1079
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,124
Hit the road.

1080
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:51,457
I want two cutlets.

1081
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:08,290
And now go away.

1082
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:10,415
Don't set foot in here again.

1083
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:16,999
We don't want 
anything to do with you.

1084
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:19,082
He hit me.

1085
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:21,207
You can't just hit 
someone like that.

1086
01:25:21,375 --> 01:25:22,790
Go now.

1087
01:25:26,125 --> 01:25:28,832
- Is that okay - to hit someone?
- Outside!

1088
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:31,499
- I can walk.
- Then go away.

1089
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:40,624
- I want my stuff.
- Get out, quick!

1090
01:25:40,791 --> 01:25:42,790
I want my stuff!

1091
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:51,624
- We have to actually 
'throw' this guy out!
- C'mon!

1092
01:25:51,958 --> 01:25:53,332
Get out!

1093
01:25:55,625 --> 01:25:57,499
Thanks for the visit.

1094
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:01,999
And go get fucked!

1095
01:26:04,291 --> 01:26:07,249
Go home.
Don't set foot here again.

1096
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:10,082
Don't let me see you again.

1097
01:27:02,041 --> 01:27:04,207
Didn't I tell you
to go fuck yourself?

1098
01:27:04,541 --> 01:27:06,249
I won't tell you again!

1099
01:27:08,791 --> 01:27:11,165
I just have one thing to say.

1100
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:19,165
- Damn!
- What's wrong?

1101
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:21,415
That's my business.

1102
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:24,582
Give him his stuff.

1103
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,124
Fuck, shit!

1104
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:37,874
45.50.

1105
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:51,082
My God, it's Lucas!

1106
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:54,165
Look at the state he's in!

1107
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:01,290
I'll talk to him.

1108
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:04,999
Let's stay here until he goes.

1109
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:13,040
Where's Fanny?

1110
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:18,540
I don't know.

1111
01:28:21,541 --> 01:28:23,082
Shit!

1112
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:58,540
CHRISTMAS EVE

1113
01:31:00,625 --> 01:31:01,957
I'd like to come in.

1114
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:46,915
Welcome, everyone.

1115
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:48,499
And Merry Christmas.

1116
01:31:48,666 --> 01:31:51,124
We will celebrate Christmas mass.

1117
01:31:51,291 --> 01:31:52,749
As always,

1118
01:31:53,666 --> 01:31:56,624
we begin with a prayer.

1119
01:32:03,708 --> 01:32:04,499
Lord,

1120
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:07,415
I'm in your house
to hear Your word.

1121
01:32:07,583 --> 01:32:09,207
God the Father

1122
01:32:09,375 --> 01:32:10,832
You, Lord Jesus,

1123
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:15,790
and the Holy Spirit, you 
comfort me in life and death.

1124
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:17,915
Lord

1125
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:22,249
may the Holy Spirit open my heart,
in the name of Jesus Christ,

1126
01:32:22,416 --> 01:32:25,374
so that I may learn
to repent my sins,

1127
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:27,665
to believe in Jesus,

1128
01:32:27,833 --> 01:32:31,624
and to live each day
in holiness.

1129
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:34,832
Hear me and grant my prayer,
my God,

1130
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,374
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

1131
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:48,124
Christmas Eve is dedicated
to the Child Jesus.

1132
01:32:48,416 --> 01:32:50,999
The son of God is born.

1133
01:32:51,875 --> 01:32:53,165
What is it?

1134
01:32:54,458 --> 01:32:55,999
I see it in his face.

1135
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:58,874
You see what?

1136
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:06,332
We can think about that
as we pray to the Lord.

1137
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:09,249
You say "Father"

1138
01:33:09,416 --> 01:33:10,957
and then

1139
01:33:11,291 --> 01:33:12,582
you become

1140
01:33:13,166 --> 01:33:14,499
a child of God.

1141
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:17,290
This is the beginning.

1142
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:21,332
Christmas time
is a time of children.

1143
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,999
This year, we celebrate Christmas
by relying on the gospel.

1144
01:33:27,166 --> 01:33:29,499
We've invited
the kindergarten choir

1145
01:33:29,666 --> 01:33:31,957
who have rehearsed,

1146
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:34,165
and now perform for us

1147
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:37,665
"A Child is born in Bethlehem"

1148
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:46,124
Come forward.

1149
01:33:46,416 --> 01:33:47,749
Stand there.

1150
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:54,374
Like that.

1151
01:33:55,375 --> 01:33:57,624
Klara, stand there.

1152
01:34:00,166 --> 01:34:01,874
One step forward.

1153
01:34:14,833 --> 01:34:19,624
A child is born in Bethlehem!

1154
01:34:20,333 --> 01:34:23,707
In Bethlehem!

1155
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:28,707
Rejoice,

1156
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:30,915
Jerusalem!

1157
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:34,874
Hallelujah!

1158
01:35:20,041 --> 01:35:22,124
What do you say?

1159
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:26,040
You got something to tell me?

1160
01:35:27,458 --> 01:35:28,915
- Wanna talk to me?
- Stop.

1161
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:30,832
You got something to say?

1162
01:35:31,833 --> 01:35:32,457
Calm down!

1163
01:35:32,666 --> 01:35:34,415
- Calm down!
- The whole town is here.

1164
01:35:34,666 --> 01:35:36,665
- Calm down.
- Wanna talk to me?

1165
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:37,957
You're sick!

1166
01:35:40,291 --> 01:35:41,082
I'm listening!

1167
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:48,582
Enough, you dirty psycho!

1168
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:50,832
I want to talk to Theo.

1169
01:35:52,416 --> 01:35:53,874
Look me in the eye.

1170
01:35:55,541 --> 01:35:56,582
In the eyes.

1171
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:02,124
What do you see?
You see something?

1172
01:36:02,541 --> 01:36:04,040
What do you see?

1173
01:36:05,166 --> 01:36:06,207
Nothing.

1174
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:08,832
There is nothing.

1175
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:12,457
Nothing at all.

1176
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:15,665
Leave me alone.

1177
01:36:17,041 --> 01:36:19,665
Leave me alone now, Theo. OK?

1178
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,707
I'll go. Thank you.

1179
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,374
You sure got enough gifts!

1180
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:54,374
You're lucky.

1181
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:57,332
It's exactly what you wanted.

1182
01:37:01,333 --> 01:37:02,249
I got her.

1183
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:37,624
Fanny...

1184
01:37:51,458 --> 01:37:52,624
Lucas...

1185
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:56,540
Hi, Lucas.

1186
01:38:06,791 --> 01:38:09,665
It shouldn't have happened.

1187
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,249
Klara, my dear.

1188
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:30,915
It's not Lucas, it's dad.

1189
01:38:39,333 --> 01:38:42,124
- Dad, are you crying?
- No.

1190
01:38:44,208 --> 01:38:45,249
It's just that...

1191
01:38:46,625 --> 01:38:49,374
the world is full of wickedness.

1192
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:52,582
But if we support each other,

1193
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,957
it will eventually go away.

1194
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,124
You're really sad?

1195
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:04,332
No.

1196
01:39:06,375 --> 01:39:08,165
You know...

1197
01:39:09,041 --> 01:39:10,415
Lucas

1198
01:39:11,125 --> 01:39:12,332
is daddy's 

1199
01:39:13,125 --> 01:39:15,124
best friend.

1200
01:39:15,291 --> 01:39:16,207
Together...

1201
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:19,999
we rode our mopeds,

1202
01:39:20,458 --> 01:39:23,249
stole apples and everything.
I've told you that.

1203
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:28,207
I just said some stupid stuff.

1204
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:33,249
He didn't do anything.

1205
01:39:41,875 --> 01:39:45,582
No.

1206
01:39:48,291 --> 01:39:50,499
Go beddy-byes.

1207
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:09,582
What are you doing?

1208
01:40:09,833 --> 01:40:11,624
Go join the others.

1209
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:15,624
Who is that for?

1210
01:40:17,875 --> 01:40:20,040
Give me ten minutes.

1211
01:40:20,208 --> 01:40:21,957
I'll be back.

1212
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:24,124
Theo...

1213
01:40:25,833 --> 01:40:26,957
don't go to him.

1214
01:40:29,916 --> 01:40:31,624
Let me do this, Agnes.

1215
01:41:02,833 --> 01:41:04,290
It's only me.

1216
01:41:11,875 --> 01:41:13,582
What are you doing here?

1217
01:41:22,458 --> 01:41:25,290
I brought you some food.
Just in case...

1218
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:31,915
Are you hungry?

1219
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:41,290
Go ahead, eat,

1220
01:41:41,833 --> 01:41:42,999
if you want.

1221
01:42:47,791 --> 01:42:48,915
This is very good.

1222
01:42:50,541 --> 01:42:52,624
You can go home if you want.

1223
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:06,540
Actually, I'd like 
to stay a while.

1224
01:43:07,291 --> 01:43:08,624
If it's OK with you.

1225
01:44:07,916 --> 01:44:12,290
ONE YEAR LATER

1226
01:44:35,625 --> 01:44:37,290
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1227
01:44:41,583 --> 01:44:43,040
Hello, Jorgen.

1228
01:44:45,708 --> 01:44:46,999
- Torsten.
- Marcus.

1229
01:44:50,208 --> 01:44:52,665
Hi, Dan. We're back.

1230
01:44:57,958 --> 01:44:59,957
- Glad to see you.
- Me too.

1231
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:07,332
Silence, please.

1232
01:45:08,291 --> 01:45:11,957
We're all gathered here
for a reason.

1233
01:45:12,458 --> 01:45:14,040
This is the day

1234
01:45:14,416 --> 01:45:16,082
when the boy becomes a man

1235
01:45:16,541 --> 01:45:18,249
and man becomes a boy.

1236
01:45:18,416 --> 01:45:19,874
Marcus, big guy,

1237
01:45:21,416 --> 01:45:22,874
you have your hunting license

1238
01:45:23,416 --> 01:45:25,582
and tomorrow, at daybreak,

1239
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:27,749
it will be your turn.

1240
01:45:28,416 --> 01:45:31,415
You'll become a man.

1241
01:45:31,666 --> 01:45:34,624
You'll conquer the forest.

1242
01:45:34,791 --> 01:45:36,249
Come here, buddy.

1243
01:45:46,625 --> 01:45:50,207
It's a great joy to see you here.

1244
01:45:51,416 --> 01:45:53,832
This is for you.

1245
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:10,665
I'd be delighted

1246
01:46:11,041 --> 01:46:11,915
if you were my son

1247
01:46:12,083 --> 01:46:15,499
and if this gift came from me.

1248
01:46:16,083 --> 01:46:18,665
But it's a gift from your father.

1249
01:46:19,458 --> 01:46:20,999
He passes it on to you.

1250
01:46:21,541 --> 01:46:25,707
It's been in the family
for generations

1251
01:46:26,291 --> 01:46:27,207
and now

1252
01:46:28,166 --> 01:46:29,832
it's yours.

1253
01:46:30,708 --> 01:46:32,082
Take good care of it.

1254
01:46:32,666 --> 01:46:35,082
Your grandfather

1255
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:38,165
missed many a deer

1256
01:46:38,625 --> 01:46:40,040
before he could feed 
your family with it.

1257
01:46:40,791 --> 01:46:43,457
Do not forget it. Congratulations.

1258
01:46:44,666 --> 01:46:47,040
Hopefully he'll drink a cup with us!

1259
01:46:47,208 --> 01:46:49,665
A shot with us!

1260
01:46:58,375 --> 01:46:59,790
Health and congratulations!

1261
01:47:00,333 --> 01:47:02,624
Lunch is served.

1262
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:09,290
Any more left?

1263
01:47:09,458 --> 01:47:11,582
- We'll bring more.
- Thank you.

1264
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,290
This is not easy.

1265
01:47:33,125 --> 01:47:35,457
All these lines you must avoid!

1266
01:47:35,625 --> 01:47:38,415
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1267
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:42,290
Hi, Klara.

1268
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:46,374
Are you okay?

1269
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:02,082
How 'can' you avoid these lines?

1270
01:48:02,791 --> 01:48:04,749
I don't know. There are so many.

1271
01:48:15,291 --> 01:48:16,290
Come.

1272
01:48:22,916 --> 01:48:24,582
Careful...

1273
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:29,082
Must take giant steps.

1274
01:48:30,666 --> 01:48:31,790
Made it!

1275
01:48:32,791 --> 01:48:34,457
I think your dad is there.

1276
01:48:37,541 --> 01:48:39,415
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

1277
01:48:56,875 --> 01:48:58,249
You're scaring the deer.

1278
01:49:00,583 --> 01:49:01,165
What?

1279
01:49:03,875 --> 01:49:05,624
- Did I ruin everything?
- No.

1280
01:49:06,041 --> 01:49:06,957
They'll be back.

1281
01:49:09,666 --> 01:49:10,707
Stay at your post.

1282
01:49:10,875 --> 01:49:13,874
It may take a while
but the deer will come.

1283
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:16,832
Are you ready?
